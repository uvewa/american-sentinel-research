"Now in the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also into writing." The proclamation that he made was for the restoration and rebuilding of Jerusalem. (At the time mentioned, the Jewish nation was subject to the Medo-Persian kingdom.)

Upon Ezra, the priest, rested the burden of this work. When they had chosen from all the tribes of Israel, men fit for the work, and all was ready for their journey to Jerusalem, "then," writes Ezra, "I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance. For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken to the king saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against them that forsake him. So we fasted and besought our God for this; and he was intrusted of us."

The principles of the gospel have been always the same. The people of God back in that day professed to that earthly kingdom that God would protect them against their enemies. They now saw that their path was beset with foes and they must either depend wholly on God, as they said they would, or go to the king for protection, thus denying their profession.

Ezra says, "We fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us."

The church *to-day* claims the Lord as her glory and strength and that she must, in her controversy with evil, use the "sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God."

Notwithstanding this, a large portion of it, associated in organizations, such as the "National Reform Association," "American Sabbath Union," "Women's National Sabbath Union," etc., are saying in word or action what was said in a speech by W. F. Crafts, in a plea for legislation in behalf of the church, made before a committee of Congress in 1888. He said, "What we ask for, is law;" and why do they ask for law? It is to furnish them power to overcome the world; yet all the while they are professing that "This is the victory that over-cometh the world, even our faith." All this they do and are not ashamed.

"O, Consistency, thou art a jewel!"

If the church would but practice what she preaches, and possess what she professes, the world would see her good works and be led to glorify our Father which is in heaven.
