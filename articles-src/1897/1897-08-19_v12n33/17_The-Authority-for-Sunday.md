It is not often that the advocates of Sunday rest feel called upon to bring forth out of its obscurity the Scriptural authority for Sunday, being for the most part content to rest upon the assumption that the day so generally observed throughout the Christian world must be the Scriptural Sabbath. Occasionally, however, the disembodied spirit, as it were, of Sunday authority is called upon to materialize, for the edification of its adherents and the discomfiture of those who believe in the day set apart by the Creator. The results obtained are not always satisfactory to the former.

One occasion of this kind is reported from Ellis Mound, Ill. Two members of the Missionary Baptist church at that place, Messrs. Denson and Atteberry, by name, were put on trial for heresy, in having "gone off with the Advents." The former is an adult, possessing a good knowledge of the Scriptures and ability as a speaker and writer, while the latter is a youth of sixteen years, who at the time of his trial had been studying the Bible only a few weeks. Accordingly, Mr. Denson's case was disposed of by simply calling upon him to state whether he kept Saturday or Sunday, after which he was expelled from the church by a vote,—only four voting out of a membership of one hundred and twenty. The consideration of young Mr. Atteberry's case, however, was deemed a fitting opportunity to "expose the fallacy of the seventh-day theory," which the pastor of the church, or "moderator," proceeded to do, as follows:

**Moderator.**—"Willie, did you ever work on the first day of the week, the Lord's day?"

**Willie.**—"I have worked on the first day of the week."

**Mod.**—(After expressing some regret and making some further remarks) "Willie, don't you believe the Saviour rose from the grave on the first day of the week?"

**Willie.**—"Yes."

**Mod.**—"Did he not meet with his disciples on the same day?"

**Willie.**—"Yes."

**Mod.**—"If they met for worship on the first day of the week, should we not do the same?"

**Willie.**—"They didn't meet for worship."

**Mod.**—"Then what did they meet for?"

**Willie.**—(Quotes from the Bible) "They were assembled, the doors being shut for fear of the Jews." (Laughter at the moderator's expense.)

**Mod.**—"Did not Paul meet with the church at Troas and break bread on the first day of the week?"

**Willie.**—(After opening Bible and reading from Acts 2:46) "If breaking bread makes a day sacred, then all days are sacred."

**Mod.**—"There; that will do. Sit down. As I said before, we don't want to discuss this subject. I only ask these few questions to show the fallacy of the seventh-day theory. Sit down." (Mr. Atteberry's case was laid over for further consideration.)

Those in the audience who were not entirely satisfied with this materialization of evidence for Sunday's claims, could reflect for their consolation that this was but a small part of the evidence that might have been given,—that there was much more that might have been brought out, just as good as this!
