The ministers of San Francisco, Oakland, and Alameda, Cal., have formed an alliance for the purpose of supplying the citizens with instruction and guidance in practical politics, so that the conscientious voter may know how his vote should be cast to advance the cause of righteousness. This scheme has a very plausible look upon its face. Who should know how to vote righteously better than the clergy? Who are more interested in promoting the cause of righteousness in the earth than those of high station in the churches? So plausible is this that it was long ago thought of and put into effect in nearly every country of the civilized world. That is to say, the management of political affairs was put into the hands of the very good men who stood at the head of affairs in the church. And the result was that the civil governments became no better, but a great deal worse.

"Oh, but it is going to be different this time. It is true that the church people never managed politics with good results before, but they are going to do better now. They are going to avoid all the mistakes that were made before." Will they? Where is the evidence of it?
