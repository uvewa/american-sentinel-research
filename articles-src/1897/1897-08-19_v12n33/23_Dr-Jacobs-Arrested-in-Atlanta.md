THE Atlanta Journal (Ga.), of August 2, makes mention of the arrest of Dr. Joseph Jacobs, proprietor of a drug store in Atlanta, for doing work in his store on Sunday. The Sunday law of Georgia has been quite generally disregarded by merchants and business men throughout the State, and the case of Mr. Jacobs will test the practicability of enforcing it to the letter upon all classes of citizens.
