The legislature of Kentucky, some time since, passed a bill appropriating $300 to pay for prayers by the chaplain during its session. When this fact was known, the "Jessamine Liberal League" protested against the measure through the press, and served notice that it would get out an injunction restraining the State treasurer from disbursing public funds for such a purpose. When the bill came to Governor Bradley, however, he refused to sign it, and is alleged to have said in reference to it that "to pay for praying for such a legislature would upset the whole plan of salvation." State Treasurer Long is also reported as adverse to the measure, and is quoted as saying that "it had long been a custom to pay for prayer in the legislature; but the new constitution had forever set such an unjust and unwarranted thing aside as nothing short of a species of petty robbery in the name of religion." So it appears that the Kentucky legislature will, for a time, dispense with official prayers.

It is certainly true that to take money from the people by taxation or any other method of compulsion, to expend for religious purposes, is wholly contrary to the plan of salvation; for that plan knows nothing of compulsion. In this matter, therefore, Kentucky is setting an example worthy of imitation by her sister States.
