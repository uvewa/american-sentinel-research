A Distinguished Catholic theologian, in an article upon the subject of labor and religion, written for American workingmen and published in the *Catholic Mirror* of July 24, says:

"As the State (any State) has no religion and can have none, and yet it is dependent upon it for its own very life, it should foster and encourage the private enterprises that teach it, and which try to enforce it upon the individual character to reach the body politic."

In regard to the above statement, it may be said, first, that if by "religion" Christianity is meant, and that therefore the continuance of a State is dependent upon its promotion of the Christian religion, the argument will not hold, simply because it is not true. The Roman State, firmly united to Christianity, as the author above quoted conceived it, fell; while the Chinese State, which antedated the Roman State by several centuries, has survived it by centuries. Many other States which have fostered and protected "Christianity" have fallen and perished. It may be greatly doubted if the Christianity that will allow itself to be fostered and protected by a State is of as much value as a preservative as are some other religions.

To day the world wonders at the vitality of the Ottoman Empire, which persists in living in spite of the concert of European doctors which have again and again assembled for its post-mortem. Lately it has shown so much vigor that the Christian press refer to it dolefully as the "rehabilitation of Turkey." No one who has studied the subject doubts that the chief reason of this reserve vitality and life of the Turkish State is religion; but it is the religion of Mohammed. So we repeat, if the writer above quoted means Christianity by the word religion, his logic is extremely faulty.

But there is another point suggested by his statement: Can a State have religion? As regards this, it is certain that it cannot have religion like a person. Circumcision is one of the requirements of Mohammedanism and baptism one of the requirements of Christianity, but the Ottoman State cannot be circumcised, neither can the German State be baptized. In fact, none of the individual acts required of a believer in any religion can be performed by a State. Hence, a State cannot have or practice religion as individuals do.

But we are accustomed to speak of "State religion," and States do have religion in a certain way. They throw the mantle of their favor and protection over and around one religion. When the Ottoman Empire thus favors Mohammedanism, it makes it the religion of the Ottoman Empire or State, and when any State whose people profess the Christian religion, by its laws or in any way, do the same thing for "Christianity," fostering and encouraging it, then that State has religion, the "Christian religion," in the only way that a State can have religion.

There may of course be degrees in the closeness of the connection of a religion and a State. It may be tacitly understood and adhered to, or there may be a distinct pronouncement of the same. Furthermore, a tacit agreement, relying on ancient and well-established precedents, may be more active and stronger than an absolute pronouncement, which the people have outgrown, and which, for this reason, is not lived up to. In other words, the thing itself is of more account than the name of it. Viewed in this light, more States have religion than we have imagined.
