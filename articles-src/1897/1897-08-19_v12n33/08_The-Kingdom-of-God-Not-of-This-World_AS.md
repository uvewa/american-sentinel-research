Any man in the world has a natural right to remove from the land of his nativity to any other country, and, by prescribed formula, to change his citizenship if he chooses to do so. Moreover, he has a right to return to his native country, as a citizen of his adopted country under its protection, as a foreigner in his native land. To advocate this principle in a legitimate way is not in any sense anarchistic or treasonable.

The kingdom of God is as real and tangible as any earthly government, but more completely perfect. This kingdom is also called the "kingdom of heaven," Matt. 13:24; the "commonwealth of Israel," Eph. 2:12; and a "holy nation," 1 Peter 2:9.

Of this nation, any one may become a citizen by adoption through faith in Jesus Christ, the king. All such are called citizens. See Eph. 2:19 and Phil. 3:20, Revised Version. All others are called aliens, strangers, foreigners, etc. See Eph. 2:11, 12, 19.

In becoming a citizen of the kingdom of heaven one thereby ceases to be a citizen of any nation of this world; and all that he is, and all that he has on earth, is transferred to the nation of his adoption. He cannot exercise any earthly franchise or engage in political discussions disconnected from the interests of the kingdom and glory of God without the loss of spirituality, and the disfavor of his heavenly King.

For obvious reasons, the land of one's nativity seems dearer than any other in the world; yet, to the child of God, all earthly countries become the same, though differing in natural aspects and political environments; he being a stranger and foreigner on earth wherever he may go.

It is the duty of the citizen of the kingdom of God to lead a quiet and peaceable life wherever his lot on earth may be cast, to observe the laws and usages of the respective governments, even though oppressive, so long as to do so will not violate the principles of the government of God.

A citizen of the kingdom of heaven need not go from nation to nation on any mission or duty without the protection of his King. Of God's ancient people, it is written, "When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people; He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes." Ps. 105:13, 14.

Earthly governments are usually represented in the Bible by wild beasts. All beasts are proper creatures of God, useful and beautiful in their sphere. But a beast cannot be a Christian in the likeness of God; no more can any nation which God symbolizes by a beast. The Government of the United States is represented by a two-horned beast. See Rev. 13:11.

Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world." John 18:36. Again, to his people, "Ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world." John 15:18. And again in prayer to the Father, concerning his people, "They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world." Chap. 17:14. Therefore, if his kingdom is not of this world, and his subjects are also not of this world, but hold their citizenship in heaven, they have no proper citizenship in this world, although that right may still be recognized by their fellowmen.

Paul said, concerning the kingdom of God, "The weapons of our warfare are not carnal." 2 Cor. 10:4. All agencies and implements of destruction used in war, and all methods of coercion employed in civil life are carnal methods, absolutely disallowed in the kingdom of Christ. Jesus said of his people, "The devil shall cast some of you into prison." Rev. 2:10. But he gives no commission to his ambassadors (ministers of the gospel) or any of his subjects to imprison the devil or any of his followers; much less to act as the devil does toward their fellow-religionists or anybody else.
