As a grand climax to the day's proceedings at the Chautauqua Assembly in Champaign and Urbana, Ill., August 6–15, the following episode took place on Sunday the 8th inst.:

A large cross without decoration of any kind was held by an attendant at one side of the stage, and a large American flag at the opposite side of the stage. While the grand old song "America" was being sung by the assembled thousands, the cross and flag were borne toward each other, the flag being caused to fall in graceful folds about the cross.

To the casual observer, perhaps, there is nothing significant in this transaction; but to the student of prophecy, to those whose attention has been called to the spirit of the times in which we live, and to those who discern which way the wind is blowing, so to speak, that one event means a great deal, and the idea carried out to its logical conclusion means nothing less than a union of Church and State.

To this end the leaders of all the different religious societies are laboring. Deny it as they will, it is bound to crop out here and there, either at Chautauqua assemblies or at some of their great conventions.

In conversation with the ordinary individual, when the subject of religious liberty is presented to him and the danger is shown him of a union of the ecclesiastical with the civil power in America, about the first dodge that he makes is to cite our national Constitution and quote the First Amendment thereto with great gusto; but how many are there out of a thousand or out of ten thousand who are aware that our Government, executively, judicially and legislatively, has committed itself and established a precedent that is a menace to our liberties. All it requires is a practical application, and we would have the Dark Ages over again and thereby would history again repeat itself. The camel has his head already in the tent, and it is only a question of time and a short time at the longest, when his whole body will be inside the tent; and then what?

And what makes this thing all the more difficult to believe is that Protestants are helping it along. Were the papacy at the helm it would not be wondered at so much perhaps. However, the papacy is only biding her time, and when the final blow is struck that will deprive us of our liberties, America can thank so-called Protestantism for it. Let us study our Bibles more diligently and see for ourselves whether these things be so.
