The tendency of the times to "take the law into one's own hands"—which means to set passion in the seat of justice—was illustrated in a marked manner recently in West Virginia. The matter has elicited general newspaper comment, as well it might. The facts and their significance are well set forth in the following from the New York World:

"W. S. Kimes shot Ben Hall three times for 'alienating the affections' of his (Kimes') wife. On trial Kimes received the purely nominal sentence of twenty-four hours' confinement in jail and a fine of $100.

"Governor Atkinson has now remitted even this trivial sentence, and in doing so he has preached an extraordinary and dangerous doctrine from the chair of a State's chief executive. 'My only regret,' he says, 'is that Kimes did not kill Hall. He ought to have done so.' 'Every man who has a soul in his body will agree with me that he ought to have killed him.' . . . 'Kimes did what every man should have done under the circumstances, except that he should have practiced with a revolver or double-barreled shotgun, so that when he made the attempt he would have brought Hall down.'

"That is to say, Governor Atkinson has issued a proclamation setting aside the laws of his State against murder and manslaughter, and notifying every man whose wife may go astray that he may kill the man who becomes her companion, without the slightest fear even of a fine.

"The fact is, as every intelligent person knows, that no man ever 'alienates the affections' of a wife. It is safe to assume that in such cases the alienation was effected long before the other man came upon the scene, and in face of the obligation resting upon every husband to retain the love and regard of his wife. When a governor not only uses his pardoning power in one case, but in effect promises to use it in every case, to shield murder done for this cause, thus authorizing jealous and hot-headed men to make themselves judge, jury and executioner, without even hearing testimony, that governor becomes an enemy of the law which he is sworn to maintain, an instigator of crime and its official protector."
