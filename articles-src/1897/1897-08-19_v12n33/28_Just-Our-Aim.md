MR. A. P. BRANAMAN, of LeRoy, Illinois, in remitting for a club of SENTINELS, says: "I am glad to tell you that the SENTINEL is gaining ground here. Wage the battle on the strongest foundation, which is the plain truth; give the people to understand the times in which we live, and what manner of men we ought to be."
