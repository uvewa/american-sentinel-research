THE following letter from a subscriber in Missouri is appreciated: "I am seventy-six years old, and am afflicted in many ways, but when I received your invitation to kindly aid in securing a few subscribers under your special offer, I thought how pleased I would be if I could send you even one subscription, but I am glad to tell you that I have been able to secure five, for which I enclose the money, and I hope to send you others before the offer closes. I have been a constant reader of the SENTINEL ever since its first issue, and I prize it highly. My prayer is that God may bless it and every one employed thereon."
