A WARM friend of the SENTINEL writes us from one of the western States saying, that in conversation with a member of the conference committee, it was thought feasible to recommend that the workers throughout the conference be invited to devote two or three hours each day for several days canvassing for subscriptions to the SENTINEL under its special offer. Is not this an idea worthy of consideration?
