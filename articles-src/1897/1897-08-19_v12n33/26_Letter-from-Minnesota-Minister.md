ELD. D. F. CURTIS, of Wasioja, Minn., a veteran minister and staunch friend of the SENTINEL, in sending in his third subscription order, says: "I rejoice to learn of the additions to your list under the special offer, and could but wish that it might increase to 100,000. May the Lord bless the SENTINEL to the good of the people everywhere."
