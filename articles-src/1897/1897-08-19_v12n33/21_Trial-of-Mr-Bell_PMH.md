The following notes relative to the trial of Mr. Bell, at Tupperville, Ont., for Sunday work, as announced in our last issue, are from a letter by Eld. P. M. Howe, a member of the Adventist community at Chatham, Ont. Elder Howe was present at the trial, and sends the following under date of August 11:

"Brother Bell asked me to talk for him in the case. They brought only three witnesses against him. The constable laid the complaint. The chief witness, Mr. McKay, swore that he was forty rods or more away from Mr. Bell at the time, and that he thought Mr. Bell was working. When I asked Mr. McKay what he was doing so far back on his farm on Sunday, he replied, 'I was salting my sheep.' He thought that was a work of necessity and did not think Mr. Bell was doing work of necessity, for he had a horse in the field. The justice refused to take any of the testimony in cross-examination. The whole matter was illegally conducted from start to finish.

"We explained Brother Bell's reasons for pleading 'Not Guilty,' and held that the enforcement of the statute as now amended would involve every farmer in trouble if he had an enemy who wished to take advantage of it to get revenge.

"All testified that Brother Bell was a kind, good neighbor, and very accommodating. He had furnished wheat for seed and flour for bread for a long time to the chief witness who came into court to swear him into jail if possible. It is a singular fact that Sunday laws are all based on false premises, and when enforced, nearly every case is so obscure that men must be found who will swear falsely to secure conviction.

"Brother Bell works every Sunday, but has been careful to go back into his fields. I visited his place yesterday, and the potato patch where he was seen July 25th is about eighty rods back from the road. It is fifty-five rods from where his neighbor was salting sheep, with several rows of thick high corn growing between.

"The justice in summing up the case said that this trouble had all arisen over a little matter of difference in religious belief; but in his mind he believed that the testimony taken showed that Mr. Bell had worked on the sabbath, the 25th of July, and other sabbaths. I asked him if he was trying Mr. Bell for sabbath breaking; so he corrected himself and called it the 'Lord's day.'

"He said he felt like being very easy with Mr. Bell, because of his peculiar belief about keeping Saturday, but the law of the land must be obeyed. Therefore he would only fine Mr. Bell $5 and costs, or fifteen days in jail, with ten days to pay fine or take an appeal."

Upon notice being given that the case would be appealed, the justice concluded to dismiss the case, without costs, which was accordingly done.
