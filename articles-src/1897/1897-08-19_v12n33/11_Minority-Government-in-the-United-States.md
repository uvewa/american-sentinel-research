*Albert Hart, in "Christian Register."*

The most familiar principle of American politics is that the majority invariably rules. This principle is supposed to be the foundation of popular government, to distinguish republics from oligarchies and monarchies, and civilized republics from anarchies: it is the stock theme of those who boast of the free system of America. It is the principle nearly universal in clubs, meetings, and stock comparies.

The principle of the supremacy of the majority is supposed to apply with peculiar force in the United States, where a long course of political training has accustomed people to submit to a political defeat without a military struggle. Where, in a Spanish-American State, a party beaten at the polls takes refuge in a revolution, we comfortably assure ourselves that we are willing to wait for a slow change of public opinion; and we compare ourselves favorably with people who consent to accept "the will of an autocratic emperor or of a titled House Lords."

In practice there is not and never has been in the United States, or elsewhere in the world, such a thing as majority government. If we have never known the will of an absolute monarch or the weight of a small, conquering host, we nevertheless submit regularly and patiently to the rule of a fraction of the population. Out of our population of seventy millions, nearly half is cut off from voting because of its sex; and all the male children and minors are also excluded. Unnaturalized foreigners are in most States not allowed to vote. The total number of voters in 1896 was only about sixteen millions; and of these only some thirteen millions, perhaps, actually cast votes for presidential electors.

Assuming that all the persons who cast their votes are actuated by intelligent principles, the political machinery in use in the United States, is, nevertheless, so arranged as to prevent the will of the majority of voters from prevaling. Most elections are but a choice between two complicated propositions. Shall the representative of one party, with its variety of schemes and policies, be chosen? or shall a man who has another set of promises be preferred? Shall a member of a legislature be chosen who will vote for three measures of benefit to his community and for two which will bear against those interests? or another person, who will vote for four measures in favor of his district and for only one against it, but who is notoriously venal? The poor majority finds itself confused, and in most cases ends by voting the straight ticket put up by the party with which it is in general most in accord. Where the country supposes that two tickets represent two distinct lines of policy, what is the guarantee that the party which gets the majority will press that issue to a settlement?

The voter is not able to bring up for a vote men who do distinctly stand for his principle, because the nominations of candidates are in few hands. In the city of Greater New York the "Republican organization" numbers, perhaps, five thousand persons, the "Democratic organization" not many more; and the "organizations" nominate the candidates. In such a case it is nearly impossible for voters, in large districts, to know the character of candidates put forward. Add to this the fact that most municipal and many State tickets are made up by a previous combination, the friends of one candidate agreeing with the friends of a candidate for a different office that their votes shall be joined for both persons, and we have a state of things in which the shrewd and able minority which controls the party machinery must in most cases impress its candidates, and thus its policy, upon the blundering majority.

Another political engine distinctly intended to further minority government is the Gerrymander. Its effect, wherever applied, is so to combine groups of votes as to enable the minority party to elect more persons than are chosen by the majority party. Further, without any such jugglery, our peculiar system of presidential elections is such that it is a well known fact that at least three Presidents of the United States have received a smaller number of popular votes in the aggregate than their defeated opponents.

In carrying on popular elections, third parties and third candidates favor minority government, because, under the almost universal American custom, a plurality of votes elects, so that persons are very often chosen who have less than a majority of the votes cast. A more serious disturbance is bribery. It need hardly be pointed out, in a country in which money is regularly used in many States at every important election, that buying votes is a transfer of a national majority into a ruling minority, and, eventually, if unchecked, into an oligarchy of men rich enough to buy votes on a great scale.

Quite aside from party fealty is the practice of "log-rolling." This exactly corresponds in legislation to the making of slates in elections. A agrees to vote for B's amendment, if B will vote for A's; and A and B, combined, thus force through a measure neither part of which could perhaps have secured a majority upon its own merits. In Congress the practice of log rolling has been elaborated into a system by which bills of the greatest importance become laws. The so-called conference committees are, in effect, a machinery for framing bills which have no majority in either house. In theory they are formed to draft some middle measure by which each house may yield something in the point in dispute. In practice they frame new measures, including details not voted for or insisted upon by either house. The conference committees are merely a delegation of the power of the majority to a small minority.

The natural result of the complications which prevent the will of the majority from being ascertained, or, when ascertained, from being carried out, leads directly to the most objectionable form of minority government; namely, to one man power. The agent through whom the majority is now usually compelled to yield to the minority is the political boss, whose rule is extending from the great cities into State politics, and is threatening national politics. He alone is able to make a combination of men and measures which, through our peculiar political methods, may receive the legal plurality of votes. He heads and represents the majority in a small clique of political leaders who control a section of party, which is dominant in the party itself; and that party has the support of the majority of voters in a city or a State.

The noteworthy thing about the whole system is that the majority still appears to retain its powers.
