In accordance with the usual custom of the office, no paper will be issued next week, hence this is the last opportunity we will have of speaking a word concerning our special offer before reaching the limit of its duration. To say that we have been gratified at the response fails to express our feelings; and more when we say that there seems to be no abatement of interest, but rather an increase. As we go to press, we are close to the three thousand mark of new subscriptions, and nearly all have been received in a little over two weeks. We wish that the SENTINEL family could have an opportunity to glance over our daily mail, and note the sentiment pervading the letters containing subscriptions.

Something of the interest manifested may be judged when the fact is known that nearly two hundred individuals have sent in clubs, some of them containing as high as thirty-five and forty names. One man in Montana forwards a list of thirty-six subscriptions as the result of two afternoons' effort among the business men of his town. An old lady over eighty years of age, who was an eye-witness of the thrilling scenes surrounding the martyrdom of Elijah P. Lovejoy, and in whose breast beats as strongly as ever the true principles of religious liberty, writes that she could not keep her room when she read our special offer, but felt impelled to go out and work in its behalf, and as the result forwards us a nice list of subscribers. We might multiply incidents of this character to almost any length, but it is not necessary. We simply mention them to emphasize the character of the constituency back of the SENTINEL.

And now less than two weeks remain before our special offer closes. Will not those who have not, as yet, because of force of circumstances, done anything in its behalf, secure for the paper at least one new subscriber? Is this unreasonable? Is it asking more than we can expect?

Jefferson in his day declared the time would come when the people would grow careless of their liberties. Will any one, alive to the events transpiring around us, deny that that time is now here? Certainly not; and it therefore behooves every lover of his country who prizes liberty of conscience to keep his eyes open and help to tell the people what all these things mean. So, under these circumstances, every effort made to circulate the AMERICAN SENTINEL is but a labor of love put forth to bless humanity. Who would hesitate to lend a helping hand? We believe not one; and therefore we confidently expect that the next ten days will roll up a list exceeding what we have already received. Shall it not be so?
