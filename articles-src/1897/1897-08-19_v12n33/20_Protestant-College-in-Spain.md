THE Independent (N. Y.), of August 12, gives the following item of news from Spain, which contains a lesson in religious liberty:

"For many years Pastor Fritz Fliedner, son of the famous Kaiserswerth reviver of the order of deaconnesses, has been the leading missionary of Protestantism in Spain. Among his successful operations has been the establishment of a Protestant college in Madrid, costing $50,000, which is now under roof and rapidly approaching completion. This success has aroused the opposition of the clericals, and the bishops of Vitoria, Santander, Leon and Valencia, together with the archbishop of Burgos, have united in a strong appeal to the government, demanding that this insult to the religion of the State be stopped, and that the noble sacrifices of the people for the preservation of the integrity of the State be rewarded by such protection to their religious rights. At latest reports the government has ignored this appeal."
