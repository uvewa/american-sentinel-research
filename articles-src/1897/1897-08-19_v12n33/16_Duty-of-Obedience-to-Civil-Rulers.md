"Bible Echo." Melbourne, Aus.

Of the Christian's duty to respect, obey, and pray for civil rulers, the Bible speaks in plain terms. It says: "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God." "I exhort, therefore, that first of all supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men; for kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty." "Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king." "Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work." "Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake; whether it be to the king as supreme; or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well." "Seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the Lord for it: for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace."

# LIMIT OF OBEDEIENCE TO CIVIL RULERS.

But it should ever be remembered that honor and obedience to earthly rulers are always to be rendered in subjection to the will of God. While they are the "higher powers," they are not the highest. "If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province," says Solomon, the wisest king who ever sat on a throne, "marvel not at the matter: for He that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they." Eccl. 5:8. While the law of the king is supreme in civil things, the law of God is over and above all law. In any case of conflict between the two there is but one course left for Christians to pursue,—"we ought to obey God rather than men." Acts 5:29.

It is too evident to need discussion that the law of Him who made us must stand first. Therefore, if civil rulers require idolatrous worship, all men have the right, with the three Hebrew captives, to say, "We will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up." If they forbid the worship of the true God, all, like Daniel of old, may fearlessly continue to worship him. If they require the observance of some other day as the Sabbath than the one ordained by God, all have a right to disregard such requirement, and to keep the day divinely set apart and blessed. Nay, more; it is the duty of all to do so.
