In Austria, one of the most religious countries of Europe, it appears that an individual who acquires the idea that it would be wrong for him to violate the divine command, "Thou shalt not kill," at the order of the government, and acts upon his conviction, is looked upon as exhibiting all the symptoms of lunacy. So we may conclude from the following, published in the *Independent* (N. Y.), of August 12:—

"Dr. Bela Skarvan was a Hungarian army physician on the staff of a military hospital. Six weeks before his time of service expired he informed his superiors by writing that, as he was an adherent of Count Tolstoi, he could no longer be a member of any military organization, and declined to serve any longer. At first the medical staff thought they had to do with a lunatic; but finding Dr. Skarvan firm in his convictions, his arrest was ordered and inquiries instituted as to what had best be done. He was examined before the military authorities and remained inflexible, and then, after some more weeks in jail, sentence was pronounced on him. For entertaining revolutionary ideas he was to be deprived of his rank and condemned to three months' hard labor in jail. Further, the University of Innsbruck, from which he had received his doctor's diploma, was requested to take his name off its books; and in order that his utter ruin might be secured, an order was issued prohibiting him from practicing as a physician in any part of the Austro-Hungarian dominions."

Very likely Dr. Skarvan was deemed guilty of a treasonable lack of "Christian patriotism."
