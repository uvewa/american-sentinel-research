A writer in the *Independent*, of December 31, in justifying the organizing and the workings of trusts states more frankly than we have seen before, the facts with reference both to labor trusts and business trusts. This article strikingly confirms the statements which we made in these columns a few weeks ago that the effect of all these trusts is to grind out of men every vestige of individuality, and leave them not even machines, but only parts of a vast machine. To his mind "individualism" has been carried to the extreme and has broken down; and these trusts have taken its place in the grand march of "Progress."

The writer of the article says that he is a manufacturer, and from the article itself we should gather that he is a member of a trust. The particular passages relating to the two kinds of trusts, run as follows:

### THE LABOR TRUST.

"The interior structure of labor organizations is a curious commentary on the economic current of the times, and serves well to point the moral of extreme individualism and the competitive system of business. The Union has as its cardinal principle the right of every member to a full day's pay for a full day's work. The rate is fixed as high as possible; the endeavor is to secure as much pay for as little work as possible. This is the true business instinct as business is now conducted, and it has its counterpart in the aphorism of the merchant (which is often the burden of the drummer's "instructions"): 'Get the highest price you can!'"

"Each member of a union pledges himself to support the Union and obey its rules. These rules are adopted by majority vote, after free debate; and if a member dislikes a rule he must either obey it or leave the Union. The minority has absolutely no power, and its only right is that of debate. The most important rules are those regulating the wage-rate and the hours of work. No member is to accept less than the Union's full day's pay for a full day's work. There is in it no recognition of superior ability; a carpenter is but a carpenter, a plumber but a plumber, a weaver, a weaver. Time and its compensation are the sole considerations.

"What chance is there under the Union's discipline for the display of special faculty? The law of individualism is that each shall freely exercise the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; and in this exercise find his true destiny, secure the fruits of his skill. But the Union steps in to deny this right, to crush the diverse tendencies, the particular abilities of the individual, to force every worker to the level of the whole. It does not admit superior ability. It takes away the spur to ambition and extra effort.

"There is no reason why a member should be a specially skilful workman; for he has no chance to rise, and there is no compensation for his skill. The Union's rules are admirably adapted to the *leveling* of men. The workman's wages, hours of labor, fellow-workmen and work are chosen for him, and his individual interest is sunk in the interest of the Union. The ideal union is the one whose roll of membership includes all the workers of a trade; and when this ideal is attained, and in some trades it is almost attained, the wages of all might as well be paid into a common treasury, to be used in the maintenance of the members and their families. This is Communism.

### THE BUSINESS TRUST.

"The method of the Trust is eminently practical. A number of distillers or rubber-makers enter into an agreement regarding certain main points in their respective lines of business, such as the prices of goods, the yearly production, the fields of operation, etc. If the combination includes all of the principle producers of a given line, the price is placed as high as the market will permit. If there are important producers outside the combination, the price is often fixed below the profit, sometimes below the cost point. The object is to drive competitors into the Trust, or out of the business.

"The market is divided into districts, perhaps, and each producer has the sole right to sell in one of these districts; or, each producer may make a certain grade of goods and nothing else; or, it may be, certain producers will be shut down entirely, on the ground that there is no field for them. In any case the result is the same, for the whole revenue is turned into a common treasury. The most economical plan is the most efficient and the best for each and all.

"The yearly demand is calculated by experts, and 'over-production' is avoided by making the yearly output conform to it. It is as simple as the Rule of Three. Economies are effected in every direction. No large sums of cash lie idle in products awaiting a market. Where a dozen houses had a dozen drummers traveling a district, the Trust has one or two, occasionally, when strong enough, none at all, for the dealer is forced by the demand to seek the Trust. The advertising expense becomes trifling. Where there was an office and clerks for each producer, there is now one general office, the Trust's. These advantages show themselves upon the ledger, and are the basis of goodly dividends.

"But, under this system, what has become of the individual? Free competition gave a capitalist the right to fix the prices of his goods, the right to choose his field of operation, the right to determine the rate and volume and character of his product. The Trust denies him this right, usurps so much of his power, and destroys to this extent his business individuality. The fundamental conception of the Trust is—Capital. It does not admit superior ability; where capital is equal, power is equal. It can curtail the influence of the ablest, repress his special faculty, by forcing him to submit to the dictation of the richest. Its effect is distinctly *leveling*.

"The Trust is thus the natural child of the competitive system, just as the Union is. The workman is sinking his individual interest in the interest of the Union, and the employer is finding his individual interest in the interest of the Trust."
