The managers of the Brooklyn baseball club have decided that the club will play Sunday games during the next season. This, however, is only one side of the subject. The preachers will be heard from later.

Now that the United States Government has professed religion, the natural question arises, What church will it join? Will it join the leading church—the Roman Catholic—or some one of the smaller churches?

SHORTLY before the holiday recess Representative Dalzell, of Pennsylvania, introduced into Congress a petition from the Christian Endeavor Union of that State, representing 207,000 members, asking for a Sunday law for the District of Columbia.

CARDINAL GIBBONS has expressed himself on the subject of the Sunday newspaper. He is quoted as saying that a Christian should select for Sunday reading only a paper that is clean and of high moral tone, and should resolve not to read it until he has first attended service at church.

ONE leading object of the "Religious Amendment" party is to obliterate from the public mind all distinction between the terms "secular" and "irreligious." This Government was made secular, but it was not made irreligious. A large majority of the signers of the Declaration of Independence and of those who framed the Constitution were professors of the Christian religion.

THE General Conference of Congregational Churches, recently in session at Winsted, Connecticut, appointed a committee to draft a Sunday law "which shall state fairly and clearly existing public opinion on this subject, and shall also be enforceable," and "to ask the enactment of some such law by the legislature." The latter body will begin its session this month.

THE five Roman Catholic bishops of the Province of Quebec have unanimously refused to accept the terms of the settlement of the Manitoba school controversy, and press dispatches state that the situation there is such as to amount to "a practical declaration of war between the Roman Catholic Church and the Liberal Party, headed by the Premier, Wilfred Laurier."

AN action has been brought in a Detroit (Mich.) court to restrain the Board of Education from enforcing the use of the book of prepared Bible readings in the public schools. The action is based upon the ground that the State Constitution forbids the legislature to pass any measure requiring any person to attend a religious institution, or levying a tax to support such institution.

THE New England "Sabbath Protective League" has brought an action against the proprietor of the Boston Theater, for allowing a concert to be given there Sunday, the 27th. The law, however, allows the giving of "sacred" concerts, and the court is waiting before granting the warrant until it shall have been decided by "expert testimony" whether the concert was sacred or otherwise.

"THE pastor of a Boston church," says the Christian Register, in a late issue, "last Sunday reminded his audience that, as late as 1830, a number of people were lying in jail in England because they had not attended the parish church. He suggested that, if the same rule were applied to his congregation, a hundred or more would meet the same fate." When preachers have recourse to such facts as this to stir up their congregations, it is easy to see what they would like; and when they shall have succeeded in securing conditions especially favorable for Sunday church attendance, by shutting off all labor on Sunday and all Sunday amusements, through the Sunday legislation which the Church forces are now working to secure, the next step, if the people still absent themselves, will be to affix a penalty for non-attendance. The logic of that movement has not changed at all since 1830.

THE Pope, it seems, is not satisfied with possessing a powerful Swiss body guard, but wants an army at his disposal. A press dispatch from Rome, dated December 29, reports an audience given by the Pope to a body of men representing the old "pontifical army," in which he said he had received offers from Canada, Ireland, and elsewhere from people who were ready to hasten to the defense of the Papacy, and that he "hoped the moment would soon come when he would see himself surrounded anew by sons as faithful and as well beloved" as those which had comprised the old army.

The speech is said to have produced a deep impression in all circles in Rome; but why should it be thought strange that the church of Rome, whose boast is that she never changes, should be as desirous now of controlling a military power as she was before the Pope became a "prisoner" in the Vatican?
