The novelist-preacher, Rev. John Watson, of England, who has been lately so much gazed at in this country, happened in one of his sermons to mention a few things that he believes; and now some of his admirers have caught it up and propose to make it the creed upon which Christendom shall unite. One paper, however, objects to it because "it lacks the essential quality either for a creed or a substitute for creeds, in that it comes without any authority behind it." The truth is, that it has as much authority behind it, as any, other creed ever had at its beginning. And if only its advocates could get the Government of the United States to endorse it, then it would have all the authority behind it that any other creed ever had. And if they are only persistent enough, no doubt they can bring about such an endorsement, especially as the United States Government is in the creed business anyhow.
