REV. DR. C. A. BLANCHARD, a college president and a man of unquestionable ability, undertook to prove in an address at Willard Hall yesterday afternoon that the "national conscience," whatever that may be, needs quickening by legislative enactment. The gentleman took his stand in favor of fastening the ship of State to the ship of Zion, and having it towed to the port of its manifest destiny by the Captain of our salvation. He differed radically from the views recently set forth in a Dispatch editorial on Christian citizenship.

We would like to ask the doctor how he and his followers expect to arrive at the "national conscience." Metaphysicians generally agree that conscience is the monitor that approves of what is right, or is thought to be right, and disapproves of what is wrong, or is thought to be wrong, in the individual life. But one system of philosophy may be opposed to another, and yet the schoolmen of each be honest and sincere.

The reply that Christianity universally recognizes the Christ and his divinity is no argument in favor of making him the law-giver through God's revealed word. The question would arise: Whose Christ is to be enthroned? The Arminians'? Presbyterians would object to this, for those who accept the Westminster confession cannot reconcile creative omnipotence with absolute free moral agency in man.

And Arminians would object to the Christ of Calvin, and both schools would sacrifice blood, if need be, to keep the Christ of Leo XIII. out of our organic law.

The irrepressible conflict between doctrinaires proves the utter impracticability and impossibility of the Bible becoming an organic law.

As the *Dispatch* said, in the editorial referred to, under such a system, Jews, non-believing Gentiles and agnostics, would be shut out from participation in civil affairs, thus violating a fundamental principle of this Republic—that all men are created equal.

To say that the agnostic, even, should have no vote is bigotry, whether it come from the pulpit or the pew.

Government is neither moral nor immoral—it is non-moral, and its weal depends on the integrity of those in authority.

The gentleman declared that 2,000,000 men in America, employés of corporations, are forced to work on Sunday because the natural affections prompt them. Their wives and children demand it. If they refuse to obey their masters, many of whom are ostentatiously "pious," they are discharged. But all this could be changed.

Let legislation be so shaped that every willing hand will find an opportunity open for honest industry. Then, when a man refuses to work seven days in the week because of his religious scruples, there will not be ten men ready to grab his job and comply with the corporation rules, a conspicuous feature of which is sabbath desecration.

Meantime, the *Dispatch* would like to have some adherent of Dr. Blanchard describe a composite conscience—one that would fit all the people.
