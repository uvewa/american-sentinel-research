JUDGE ROGER A. PRYOR, of the Supreme Court of this State, who a few days ago came out strong for Americanism, has now emerged with equal vigor in favor of Sabbatarianism. A number of orthodox Jews had applied for leave to incorporate a religious society, and Judge Pryor denied the application because the proposed charter provided that the society's annual meetings should be held on the second Sunday in January of every year. Such meetings, in the opinion of the judge, would be "contrary to the public policy of the State, if not to the letter of its law. A thing," he adds, "may be lawful and yet not laudable," which is axiomatic, but does not apply in this case.

This is a novel doctrine in a nation whose birth was due to a desire for religious liberty and whose Constitution guarantees its citizens against interference with their personal liberty within the law. But it is perfectly reasonable, as appears upon reflection. The people choose certain men to be judges over them, men endowed with superhuman virtue and superhuman wisdom, men like Judge Pryor and Magistrate Mott and Justice Divver and the judges of the late Mr. Tweed's time. If they should not supplement the laws enacted by their fallible fellow-citizens with their own virtue and wisdom they would fail in their obvious duty and would not be able to put a good face on it when they come into the presence of the Supreme Tribunal hereafter. The law is only a means to the great end, and not so good a means as Judge Pryor's and Magistrate Mott's heaven-inspired wisdom.

A thing may be lawful and yet not laudable, you know.
