A PREACHER of this city, David James Burrell, D. D., is trying to work up a general protest of the churches against the methods of the daily newspapers, and against the Sunday newspapers altogether. As a justification he declares "We have a right because we have the power." "We are strong enough to have our way in New York City; and New York City pitches the time for the other cities of the land. Let us act." This principle, or rather want of principle, that might makes right, is fast becoming the accepted justification of the main efforts of the church leaders. But it is altogether antichristian.
