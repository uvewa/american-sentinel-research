UNDER the above heading, the papers of the Northwest are giving an account of a disturbance in a certain school district in Minnesota, the root of which, it seems, is praying in the school. It is said that the "school row has just fairly begun." The clerk, who refused to issue an order, notwithstanding the teacher was qualified for the position, has been fined $10. A prominent county official, who was present at the trial, made a statement that the practice of praying in the school would be continued, while the majority of the school board declare that there shall be no praying in the school.

This illustrates the folly of attempting to foist religion on religious exercises upon a people against their will; or to maintain religious ceremonies, even that of prayer, where it would be better religion to follow the example of the Saviour in withdrawing from the public gaze into the mountains for prayer.
