One of the judges of the Supreme Court of the State of New York—Roger A. Pryor—seems to think himself the special guardian of Sunday as "the Christian Sabbath." A Hebrew society applied for a certificate of incorporation. The society desired to hold its annual meeting on the second Sunday of January, each year. The certificate was denied—not because any law prohibited it, but because in the judge's opinion, "In the State of New York the sabbath exists as a day of rest by the common law and without the necessity of legislative action to establish it."

The judge acknowledges that "The question is not whether such meetings on Sunday are illegal; but whether they should be approved by a justice of the Supreme Court;" and then gravely observes, "A thing may be lawful and yet not laudable." That is to say, that without any law judges may curtail the liberty of the citizen according to their own individual view of what may or may not be laudable. And the judge's view of what is laudable may spring from his own personal religious bias; yet that is to make no difference—it is to be imposed upon the citizen, and must be submitted to by the citizen, anyhow; because, though not lawful, he considers it laudable.

Judge Pryor says that "The members of the proposed corporation are of a race and religion by which not the first but the seventh day of the week is set apart for religious observance"; but that "The law which scrupulously protects them in the observance of their ceremonies gives them no license, and I am sure they have no desire, to affront the religious susceptibilities of others." That is the doctrine and the principle of the fullest possible religious despotism. For when I know that others in what they do have no desire to affront my religious susceptibilities, and then I prohibit them from doing those things lest they affront my religious susceptibilities, it is plain enough that my "religious susceptibilities" is only another name for an exceedingly despotic spirit—a spirit that would compel everybody to conform to my religious notions.

So as the conclusion of all this the judge says that "Because the holding of corporate meetings on Sunday is contrary to the public policy of the State, if not to the letter of the law, I decline to approve the certificate." And bear in mind that this "public policy of the State" is not what the people have declared by constitution or statute, but only what the judges without law and against the Constitution have decided to be the public policy of the State because according to their religious notions they consider it laudable.

Indeed, Judge Pryor follows this view so closely that in a case a few days later he refused a certificate to another organization, because their articles provided for holding the annual meetings on the last day of every year, and therefore said meetings would sometimes fall on Sunday!

And we are required to suppose that such things as this are laudable!

The Catholic Review, of January 3, considers Justice Pryor's decision so laudable a thing that it proceeds heartily to laud it in the following fashion:—

"It is well that our citizens should have from time to time an authoritative reminder that this is a Christian land; a land in which the Christian religion is a part of the fundamental law. Such a reminder has quite recently been twice given by Justice Pryor in the Supreme Court on the occasions when he refused certificates of incorporations to societies whose constitutions required or implied the holding of merely business meetings on Sunday. Both of these had for their objects nothing, apparently, that was not lawful and proper, and both were composed of Hebrews who keep the Sabbath on Saturday.

"The point made by Justice Pryor is that Sunday is a sacred day, to be kept free from business, and that this is so not merely by virtue of the statutes, but also of the more fundamental law, the unwritten law that makes Christianity a part of our system.

"We have several days in the course of the year that are by law exempted from the ordinary obligations of business, such as Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, and the like, which owe their existence to statutory enactment and are therefore described as 'legal holidays.' But though our statute law recognizes Sunday, to which it usually refers as 'the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday,' and though that statute law has sought to protect Sunday from profanation by enactments varying between rigidity and laxity, yet Sunday as 'the Lord's day' is not a 'legal holiday,' it is an institution of our system, such that, if by any chance, no mention of it occurred in our statutes yet would it be upheld by our courts as a part of the law of the land."

From this ready indorsement and use that is made of that decision, it will be seen that it is the most far-reaching thing that has been done toward a universal Sunday-religious despotism since the "Christian nation" decision of the United States Supreme Court.
