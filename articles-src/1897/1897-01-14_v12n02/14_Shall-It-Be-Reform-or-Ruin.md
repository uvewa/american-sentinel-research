At the annual banquet of the New England Society, lately held in this city, Hon. E. J. Phelps made the principal speech, in which he referred to last year's election contest, in the following words:—

"We have passed through a crisis that in my belief is the greatest this country has encountered. The distinguishing quality of this contest has been that it inaugurated for the first time in this land a controversy not merely between sections—which is bad enough—but between classes, which drew the line horizontal instead of perpendicular, separated the more fortunate from the less fortunate.

"The war is not over. One battle has been fought, but the prosperity that sanguine men looked for to follow immediately upon such a victory, has not come. . . . What this country demands is prosperity. If that returns this contest that we have been through will not be renewed. If it does not return it will be renewed, and God only knows what will be the result of it under these circumstances."

No, that promised prosperity has not come. Not only has it not come, but there are no more signs of it to-day than there were a year ago.

There is, however, prosperity of a certain kind that is entirely too prevalent for either the public good or the good of those who enjoy it. It is the kind of prosperity that is manifested in the following account of a reception given in this city on Christmas night for the two dogs named, to four other dogs:—

"The guests of Pet and Trix [these "guests" were the four other dogs] had a supper of candy, cakes and ice cream, served to them by beautiful women in evening dress. The guests of Pet and Trix drank crystal water from saucers of Sevres and Limoges. They were entertained with quadrilles danced by women only, to the music of a chorus of women. Canary birds in a cage enlivened the evening's harmony with their prettiest trills. The old parrot whom Pet and Trix have been taught to regard with reverence said nothing insolent or even frivolous.

The guests of Pet and Trix went home with new ribbons and boquets of violets. They were invited to come again on New Year's night."

Mr. Phelps and others may cry out all they please against "class-hatred" and against the growing "contest between classes which draws the line horizontal;" but so long as such things as this are carried on while multitudes are in want for the necessaries of plainest living, they will cry out in vain.

The AMERICAN SENTINEL has no part in this contest of the classes. We have nothing to do with those who on either side would do aught to excite class-hatred. At the same time, it is but just to remark that the people who engage in such scenes as this dog reception, do more in a single night to excite class-hatred and urge on such a contest as Mr. Phelps deprecates, than anybody else could possibly do in months of agitation. We deprecate class-hatred and class-contest as much as Mr. Phelps or anybody else can. Yet at the same time we know that practically it is absolutely useless to deprecate it, or to cry out against it, so long as these practices prevail, which can only the more excite it.

Mr. Phelps says that if prosperity returns the contest of classes through which the country has passed will not be renewed. At the same time he observes truly enough that the prosperity that was promised and which sanguine men looked for has not come. There can be no doubt that those on the losing side in the late contest are even now as quiet as they are, in hope of the prosperity that was so abundantly promised, provided the election should go as it really did. If that prosperity is not realized, or if times should grow worse, the danger is that when they again enter upon the contest they will do so with the determination to have what they want, promises or no promises, and if prosperity does not come they will bring it. And when that contest does come again, as Mr. Phelps well says, "God only knows what will be the result of it under these circumstances."

If the idle rich could pause in their senseless extravagance only long enough to read a few pages of the last days of the republic of Rome, or of the "ancient regime" immediately preceding the French Revolution, surely they could not fail to see that they are dancing on a volcano. Human nature will have to be changed before they can carry on those practices without exciting and deepening class-hatred. "Can we forestall ruin by reform? If we wait to be forced by events, we shall be astounded to find how much more radical they are than our utopias. Louis XVI. waited until 1793, and gave his head and all his investituers to the people who in 1789 only asked to sit at his feet and speak their mind. Unless we reform of our own free will, nature will reform us by force, as nature does. Our evil courses have already gone too far in producing misery, plagues, hatreds, national enervation."

As for us we know that by the gospel of Jesus Christ, by the power of the word of God, human nature can be changed. To this end we propose to work. Instead of attempting to allay class-hatred by crying out against it, when every day's practices of the idle rich only tend to create and deepen it, we hope so to present the truth of God that men will believe on him to everlasting life; to the destruction of all hatreds, all animosities, all selfish ambitions, all discontents; and to the patient waiting for his Son from heaven. This is the only right remedy. We wish all would apply it.
