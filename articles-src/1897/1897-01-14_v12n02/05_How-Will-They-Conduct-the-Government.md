In the Forum for December, Rev. William Bayard Hale, of Middleboro, Mass., presents a striking review of the "Church Entertainments" of the year 1896. In this, Dr. Hale is doing a good work. In view of the fact that the combined churches of the land have taken it upon themselves to reform the country and especially the Government upon their own ideas of propriety and morals, it is important that the country should know beforehand, so far as possible, about how those ideas run. As they propose to conduct the Government, it is well that the people should know first how they conduct themselves.

From a record "including more than five hundred occasions," Dr. Hale is enabled authentically to report "such religious intelligence" as the following:

"St. John's Church, Lowell, Massachusetts, in its Easter festivities, produced 'Violet in Fairyland,' and 'A Comedy of Errors up to date.' The Unity Church, Brockton, the Porter Church, Brockton, and various other congregations in surrounding towns, have delighted Southeastern Massachusetts with a laughable performance entitled 'Aunt Jemima's Album.' Another Brockton church has given a Wish-bone Party. The Christian Endeavors of Menlo, Iowa, have engaged in a New Woman Social."

"St. Paul's, Rahway, New Jersey, and several other religious societies, have presented that awakening and gladdening exhibition, 'The Mystic Midgets.' St. Paul's, Newburyport, Massachusetts, offered 'Mrs. Jarley's Waxworks,' rejuvenescent with Trilby characters (without whom no well-ordered modern church performance is complete) and The Man who Tickled his Wives to Death. Grace Church, Salem, Massachusetts, scored heavily with its 'Masque of Culture.' St. Francis de Sales, Charlestown, Boston, entertained a thousand people at a Progressive Whist Party.

"Members of the New Church, Bath, Maine, came forward with 'Woodcock's Little Game,' said to be a clever thing in the comedy vein, a brilliant series of Living Pictures, and that screaming farce, 'Poor Pillicoddy.' St. Paul's, Pawtucket, Rhode Island, held a Shakesperian Carnival; a reverend cleric, as Hamlet, did effective work in the ghost scene, and selected members of the choir, with others, rendered the lullaby from 'Midsummer Night's Dream.' Dancing furnished a fitting conclusion of the evening, the Grand March being led by Julius Caesar and the one hundred and twenty-five costumed actors.

"Unusually successful was the last annual Fair of Highland Congregational Society, Larch Street, Providence, whose place of worship was skilfully transformed into a market-place, where macaroni and suspenders—specially mentioned among other articles—were sold. The First Parish, Groton, Massachusetts, danced the New Year in, and realized about twelve dollars. The Asbury M. E. Church, Providence, has given a Hay-seed Party.

Ballou Universalist Church, Providence, has rendered 'Down by the Sea,' a two-act drama; tickets twenty-five cents, dancing not included.

**BAD:**

"Epworth M. E. Church, Toledo, has enriched its treasury by a Weigh Social. St. John's M. E. Church, Toledo, has given a stimulating entertainment by the Peak Sisters, widely known in American religious circles; introducing that touching ballad, 'Do You Know the Mouth of Man?' in which the gentle art of kissing is referred to ninety times; while the First Presbyterian Church, Toledo, has produced a refined diversion called 'Just Us Girls,' opening with a 'What Is It?' march, in which the young ladies wear their hair over their faces, and masks on the back of their heads; thus convulsing the audience by the spectacle of apparent deformities in an extraordinary series of evolutions.

"Passing on through the notices I have preserved, my eye is caught by accounts of a Mock Town Meeting, a Poker Party, a Fancy Dress Drill, a Tambourine Drill (irreverently described by the secular press a 'a winner'), a Dude Drill, a Great Moral Dime Show (introducing McGinty, a dwarf, and a petrified man), a Spider-web Party, a Mother Goose Market, and a Husking Bee. There are one or two announcements of 'Gymnastic Exhibitions' and 'Athletic Exhibitions,' which I make bold to believe are euphemisms for sparring contests. It was in the Boston Herald of only a day or two ago, that I recognized in the name 'Ike Weir, the Spider,' committed to trial for brutal assault, that of a pugilist long disreputable, who has appeared in my own town of Middleboro, Massachusetts, in a boxing-match which was a feature of a church fair. After having served his time, 'the Spider' will be an even more attractive personage for churches desiring to interest the public.

"The First Reformed Church, Bedford Avenue and Clymer Street, Brooklyn, has this year given a Living-Picture Show in which society women of the Eastern District posed in gilt frames, indifferently as St. Cecelia and Bacchante, The Madonna of Consolation, and La Zingarella. Ladies of St. John's, Youngstown, Ohio, in a black-face performance, made a pleasing appearance when they came before the foot-lights with songs, dances, and local hits.

**WORSE!**

"Now, I would not cloud with one moment's annoyance the brows of the esteemed persons who get up these shows. I do not carp at sacred Female Minstrels: they don't happen to suit my taste; but I may be peculiar. And yet when I read in the Buffalo Enquirer that at Fredonia, New York, the young ladies not only corked, but appeared in bloomers, and that at Woodside, Long Island, a similar performance was further enlivened by a pleasing act on the part of a young lady who, with enviable agility, if not discretion, kicked a tambourine held above her head, I cannot but feel that—considered as religious exercises—these doubtless delightful occasions may be, in some details, open to criticism.

"Neither can I personally with quite untempered enthusiasm commend the form which consecrated zeal has taken in the case of Grace Church, Erie and Second Streets, Jersey City. According to a press despatch, this congregation made a distinct advance in the art of sacred amusement by its recent production of 'The Talisman,' a three-act opera, the novelty being that the male rôles, those of Sir Roland and Dan Carlos, were taken by girls in fleshings. I may be wrong,—the New York Independent will correct me if I am,—but I should be disposed to regard this also as perhaps an error of taste. I know how great is the pressure for more and more exciting shows, upon churches which have gone into the theatrical business,—and the press reports state that Grace Church owes much of its prosperity to the frequency with which it provides high-class entertainments,—but, frankly, there has been, at least until recently, a prejudice against this particular costume as an attire for young ladies in church.

"I have, however, no hesitation in commending—as a successful exhibition of impudent and attractive indecency—the New Woman Social given, according to the New York papers, by the male members of the Methodist Society of Hancock, New York. Some of the more engaging toilets worn by these followers of John Wesley also described in the despatch. 'W. F. Stimpson in lilac bloomers with lace trimmings, was irresistible, as was E. H. Taylor in a Mother Hubbard, and with a weeping-willow plume. E. C. Seeley wore shiny black bloomers, set off with a gorgeous sash. J. Curtis Martin wore red bloomers and an angelic smile. Olin Henderson in check bloomerettes, Ward Thompson in a shirt waist, and W. H. Dean with balloon sleeves, were also conspicuous.'

**WORSE AND WORSE!**

"This is, possibly, funny. But for monumental godlessness made endurable by no saving grace of humor, for simian imbecility, for supreme and inimitable folly unmarried by the slightest suggestion either of common decency or ordinary self-respect, for grovelling baseness and depraved vulgarity—the Trilby Party, otherwise the Foot Social, otherwise the Ankle Auction, stands at the head of the church entertainments of the year. While others are trudging along the weary plains of the unimaginative and the ordinary, the Methodist Episcopal Church of Suffern, New York, and St. John's Protestant Episcopal Church of New Brunswick, New Jersey, with unblanched cheek and dauntless eye, have scaled the Alpine heights of deathless shame. I have received from all parts of the country marked copies of newspapers reporting these events; some of the papers bearing the request. 'Please give this your attention.' I am very willing to do so, but I regret the inadequacy of my vocabulary, and I refrain from any further attempt to characterize the performance. In the Trilby Social, as given by the Suffern M. E. Epworth League and the New Brunswick P. E. Olive Branch Society, the young ladies of the church display their—feet, let us say, and be polite,—behind a curtain which is lifted to a height described as 'tantalizing.' Men in front of the curtain view what is displayed of one female after another, and then bid for the privilege of taking her to supper. The charm of the scheme is the ease with which it lends itself to the worse than dubious; and I have no doubt that the press accounts of the scenes which attended the bidding are, in both cases, highly colored, though the most literal truth would certainly be exciting enough. The Boston Sunday Journal illustrated one of these events with a half-page picture; the New York Herald gave it a two-column illustration; the accompanying letter-press, and the reports published in other papers, describe a show which, in a respectable community, under other than ecclesiastical management, might have difficulty with the police.

"Tom-Thumb Weddings and Mock Marriages multiply. Plymouth Church, Chicago, is this year among those which have thus made Holy Matrimony a pleasing joke. One P. E. Church in Massachusetts, fired by the realistic spirit of the modern tank drama, added a vivid touch to its mock celebration of this Sacrament, by the introduction of real choir boys; but an African M. E. Church in New Bedford, with native imitative genius, outshone its white competitors with a sumptuously staged burlesque of the Marlborough-Vanderbilt nuptials. These congregations would profit under the tutor to whom St. Paul consigned Hymeneus and Alexander."

There is much more of the like in the Forum article; but this is enough to give the reader a fair idea of the general course of things in the churches throughout the country. With reference to the whole situation presented by this view, Dr. Hale justly and solemnly remarks:—

"A review of the entertainments of the past year affords evidence that, with dangerous rapidity, church entertainments are taking the nature of improper exhibitions. Ordinary buffoonery no longer draws. The more tempting attractions of the forbidden, the more spicy morsels of the variety theatre are demanded, and are being supplied. . . .

"Let us be human; let us be hearty; let us be, as we were made, men and women; but, in Heaven's name! let us insist that when people appear in, or for the benefit of, churches, they shall keep on their proper clothes. . . . The Church is not a system of theatres and music-halls. It is a divine institution with a definite, particular, and sacred office, distinct from that of all human agencies whatsoever. It is to teach the sacredness of life, by standing for the essentially sacred side of life. Its songs are not merry glees, but litanies of human hopes and sorrows, and chants of human hearts in winged aspirations seeking God.

"If there is in life anything pure, and virginal, and sweet,—God knows it is hard enough to keep the faith that there is! where is there to be kept any place and expression for it, if what are called the houses of God are given over to immodesty? . . . It may be too much to look for cleanliness on the professional stage; but surely it is beyond pardon that any body bearing the name of a Church of Jesus, the undefiled Nazarine, should, by a doubtful exhibition, sully the mind of any pure lad or tender maiden committed to its care."

## PERTINENT INQUIRY.

And beyond all this the inquiry is pertinent just now, When the churches of the land conduct themselves in these pernicious ways, how can they be expected to conduct the Government in any better way? And if they could conduct the Government in no better way than they conduct themselves, then what worse thing could befall the nation than to have the control of the Government full under the power and influence of such bodies?

Less than a month ago there was held in Chicago a joint convention of the National Reform Association and the Christian Citizenship League. This convention was held for the purpose of devising ways and means by which the church power could most speedily gain control of the Government and the nation. One of the principal speeches of the convention was made by President Blanchard, of Wheaton College, on "How to Quicken the National Conscience." He declared that "The churches make the conscience of the world at large." Let this be so, and what kind of a conscience will be that of the world at large if it shall follow the lead of the churches as portrayed in their own open practices before the world and for the "entertainment" of the world at large? As a plain matter of fact, the conscience of the world at large to-day is not so benumbed, yea, is not so debased, as these church entertainments show that the conscience of the Church is.

President Blanchard said further that "Nobody will say that amusements are right which the Church of Jesus Christ universally condemns." Let this be so: what then shall be said of amusements of the Church, which the world condemns, but which the Church indulges with avidity?

Thank the Lord, there are yet some faithful souls who are sighing and crying for the abominations that are done in the midst of her. But her sins are fast reaching unto heaven; and when she secures the governmental power to compel the people to drink of the wine of her fornications, her cup will be full, and God will surely remember her iniquities.

And even now the voice from heaven is calling "Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues."
