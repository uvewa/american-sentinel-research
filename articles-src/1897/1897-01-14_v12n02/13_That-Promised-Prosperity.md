In the last three weeks of 1896 there was a failure of a national bank for nearly every business day of that time, carrying down in their train other banks that were connected with them. In the last eight weeks of the year, of business failures of all kinds there were seventy-five more than in the same period of the year 1895.

Of course there are explanations readily offered by those who, before election, made the promises of great prosperity, provided the election should go the way it did go. The most remarkable of these explanations, because it is the most authoritative as well as the most scientific, is that which was given out December 30, by the Comptroller of the Currency, with reference to the failure of the national banks.

He gravely informs the country that one of these banks belonging to the national system was closed, "because of a want of immediately convertible assets." Oh! indeed. Would it be impertinent to inquire, How many banks, unless they were deliberately wrecked, were ever closed except "because of a want of immediately convertible assets"?

When a person dies nowadays, and the doctor does not know what caused death, the public is usually informed that he died of "heart failure." But unless a person is instantly killed, he never dies of anything else than heart failure. For whatever may be the matter with him, so long as his heart keeps going, that is, so long as his heart does not fail, he *cannot* die. The explanation that is given by the doctor of the national finances, as to why this bank failed, is precisely of the same character as that of the other doctors in the cases mentioned.

His explanation of the *results* of the failure of "the second largest bank in the city" of Chicago, is that "no other result followed than the failure of institutions for which it had long been the feeder." Well, dear sir, so far as other banks are concerned, when, in fact, *could* any worse *result* ever follow the failure of a bank? It is hardly to be expected by anybody that the failure of one bank could *result* in the failure of another with which it had no connections.

After such "explanations" as this, it is not to be wondered at that he assures the country that instead of these bank failures being taken as any real cause of apprehension, they should be looked upon as "quite the reverse," and taken as a special assurance to public confidence.

He says, that "It would be remarkable if, after the long strain of a political campaign turning so largely upon the discussion of the money question, with aggressive earnestness on the part of both contending parties, some bank and business undertakings did not feel the strain and give way." And this after months of continuous assurances, in which the Comptroller himself was personally engaged, that if only the election could be made to turn as it did, unalloyed prosperity would surely attend every branch of trade and industry!

Everybody knows that the promised prosperity has not come. The Comptroller's statement shows that he knows that it has not come; and therefore he tries to coax it to appear. He says that "It ought to be recognized that capital is not to be drawn out by threats of destruction to it, and will not be. It ought also to be recognized that when the institutions which deal in the handling of credit are compelled, through continued fright of the people, to keep in their vaults excessively large reserves, every branch of manufacturing trade and commerce must languish. The loss from all this, in the largest measure, falls upon the great body of the people who are dependent upon the activities maintained through the extending of credit by banking institutions. The desirable thing, therefore, is to have them loaning, and not hoarding, and their depositors drawing their checks for the purpose of transferring property, instead of to obtain money to place in safety vaults."

To be sure all this "ought" to be so, but it is not so. If all this were so, the promised prosperity would be prevalent. But as it is no more so now than it was before the election, those promises of prosperity were altogether vain.

Let us not be misunderstood. We do not say that the promised prosperity would have come, even had the other side won in the election campaign. If the election had gone the other way, we do not believe that times would have been any better than they are. They might have been worse. And even in the way the election did go, the times may be worse than they now are. We believe they will be worse.

And this is simply to say that in the election campaign the vital causes of present conditions were not dealt with at all. When these causes were discerned, as in some instances they were, they were dodged or beaten back, and a false issue made the all-important thing.

There may be faults in the financial system of the United States; but this is not the cause of the hard times. And such not being the cause of the evils, the cure cannot be found in any schemes of finance. The source of the trouble lies far back of all these things. It lies with the people themselves, as individuals. And as the source of the trouble lies back of the Government itself, no governmental remedies that may be applied will relieve it. No reform will be effective, but the reform of the individual. Of all places in the world, this *must* be so in a government which is of the people.

Yet as plain as this truth is, it is a fact that, with one exception, every movement for reform that is to-day attempted in the United States is aimed at the Government rather than the individual. Temperance reform has been turned altogether upon the Government. "Sabbath reform" is aimed altogether at the Government. And even what professes to be *Christian Endeavor* only, is directed almost wholly to an endeavor at reforming the Government. All this is directly the reverse of every principle of the Government of the United States, as well of every principle of Christianity; and therefore can never be anything but the reverse of that which is beneficial to both the Government and the individual.
