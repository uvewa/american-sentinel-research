No believers in the Koran are wanted in this country. Such was the decision arrived at recently by the Federal Board of Immigration in this city.

***

The case was that of six Mohammedan immigrants, who had arrived from the Orient on the steamer "California." At the Barge Office, upon being questioned, it was learned that they all believed in the Koran. The Koran sanctions polygamy. And from this the decision was arrived at that they must not be allowed to land.

***

As a matter of fact, not one of the six Mohammedans had more than one wife. That they were polygamists in practice, or contemplated becoming such in this country, no one claimed. They simply believed in the Koran, like all good Mohammedans; and this was the whole case against them.

***

There was an act of Congress passed in 1891 which enumerates polygamists among the classes which it is thought proper to exclude from this country. Among others named in this class are idiots and insane persons, criminals, those suffering from loathsome or contagious diseases, etc. To classify among such persons simple believers in the Koran is a proceeding in which there is neither reason nor justice. And when it is done, as in this instance, the conclusion at once suggests itself that the real opposition in the matter is directed against the religion for which the Koran stands.

***

This conclusion would not so readily come into view but for the fact that the United States has within recent years been posing as a Christian nation. Not yet have the last echoes died away of that decision by the Supreme Court, in February, 1892, that "this is a Christian nation." And with the opening of Congress next month, a million and a half of names will come before the national legislature calling for a recognition of God in the Constitution. These names represent the great society of Christian Endeavor; and other great religious organizations are helping to permeate the country with the same idea of a national Christianity. Such being the circumstances of the situation, it cannot be regarded as impossible or even improbable that this sentiment may have had something to do with this decision against the adherents of the Koran.

***

If it is to be established as a rule of national procedure that such a theoretical violation of the law as exists in the adherence of these six Mohammedans to the religious guide-book of their race, which sanctions polygamy, without the slightest allusion, actual or contemplated, to any violation of the law in practice, is sufficient ground for excluding an individual from residence in this country, then it is evident that justice is here about to take on an inquisitorial character which will be fatal to the survival of liberty. And of this there are, indeed, many existing indications.
