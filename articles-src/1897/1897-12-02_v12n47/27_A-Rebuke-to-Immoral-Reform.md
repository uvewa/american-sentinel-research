In the days of Parkhurst and his wicked reform in this city there was established the practice of inducing people to commit crime, and partaking with them in the crime, in order to have a chance to prosecute them. Col. Fred Grant, to his lasting honor, resigned the office of police commissioner rather than remain a member of a board that sanctioned such conduct. And now Judge McMahon, the other day in general sessions, administered a sound and deserved rebuke to the same thing. In charging a jury in such a case, the judge said:—

> "Now, as to the testimony of these two officers. The offense against morality, against good conscience, and against public order is the same, whether the officer does it under the orders of a superior and it is paid for by public money or paid for out of his own pocket. This is not the first time I have called attention to this, and I hope this will be the last time, because I hope this system will be abandoned once and forever.
>
> "Now, then, you have to pass upon the credibility of these witnesses. The statements of the officers are that under the orders of their superiors they have been engaged in this nefarious business for a considerable period of time, inducing persons to commit crime in order to convict them of it. You have the testimony of the first officer that when he entered these premises he deliberately said what was not true, that he came there from some person named Jack, a friend of his, and that is a circumstance that you have a right to consider in determining the credibility of a witness. I believe most firmly that a man who lies in the ordinary course of his duties will lie with his hand on the Bible."
