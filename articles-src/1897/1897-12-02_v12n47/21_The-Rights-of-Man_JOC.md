Widely differing views are held upon the question of man's rights, nearly all of which seem conclusive, considering the premises from which the argument is drawn. But as these conflicting deductions cannot possibly all be correct, it follows that some radical defect is present, somewhere, either in antecedent propositions or in methods of drawing conclusions. In dealing with this issue, therefore, the foundation for conclusions should be established in truth, rather than upon some selfish ground.

A "right," as defined by Webster, is that which is "conformed to the constitution of man and the will of God, or to justice and equity; not deviating from the true and just; according with truth and duty." Man was created in the "image of God," and was therefore constituted by the will of God to render service and honor to his Creator. Rev. 4:11. He was required as his personal duty, to obey God, and follow his ways in all things, that continuing like his Maker, he might retain the image in which he was made, and so ever be true and just. This was the original, and eternal "right" conferred upon man in the beginning, as a personal gift, and is still his if he will but use it. But beyond this personal duty, no right was bestowed giving one creature authority to command another in the way.

More than this, no man or set of men were given authority to pronounce upon another's moral standing, or to define his rights. Being made like his Creator, man was a son of God, and like the divine Son, was to delight in doing the divine will, because the law of Jehovah had been seated in his heart to prompt his ways. Ps. 40:6–8. Thus man was made capable of self-control under the guidance of divine suggestion. Like the angels of heaven, he was to be entirely led by this inner consciousness without the restraining influence of outward legality. Homage to God was not to be that of a servant, but of a son. Obedience was in no sense to be a forced service, but one of love. No higher motive was to be known than a spontaneous desire to do right and be right, which is the highest point of happiness it is possible to reach.

Such was and is the undoubted right of every man to-day who chooses to assert that right, even though it has been forfeited through evil association. How strange that so few seem to recognize the fact that the sum of human rights is contained in securing the highest joy, and that such joy is to be had only in God, through Jesus Christ. Separating human rights from heavenly joys, many seem to think that while one is from above, the other can be secured only through human legislatures and earthly courts of law. But civil courts can never restore these lost rights, simply because such gifts are above and beyond human jurisdiction. Its authority falls short in this work for the reason that it has no higher power, morally, than those whose rights it seeks to return. Being destitute of these rights themselves, earthly courts are absolutely without power to confer them on men, however much they might desire to do so. Even though a judge on the bench may have been fortunate enough to have acquired such endowment for himself, he could not possibly share it with another, for the reason that this heavenly gift is a personal allowance sent direct from heaven to the receiver. Whoever, therefore, undertakes to legislate, or pronounce sentence from an earthly bench, with the view to conferring a religious benefit, so that men may advantageously carry out the will of heaven, puts himself (unwittingly though it be) in the place of God, and assumes the prerogative of divinity.

The gifted Macaulay saw much truth along this line. When a candidate for parliamentary honors in 1832, he delivered a speech at Leeds, in which he is reported to have said:—

"I am for personal freedom in every part of the globe,—freedom to the white, and freedom to the negro. . . . I am for religious liberty in the fullest sense of the word. I detest all disabilities,—everything which is galling to the conscience, or which can shock the sincere scruples of any individual. . . . We act most in support of religion, and act in a manner most calculated to strengthen the interest of that religion, when we give universal freedom to religious belief. We hear it said that a policy which does not give a decided advantage to one sect over another is infidel policy. These words have been echoed and re-echoed in the country. According to this authority, justice is infidelity, and mercy is infidelity, and toleration is liberalism, and liberalism is only another name for infidelity. It is infidelity, it seems, to think worthily of God and justly of his law, and not to encircle with worldly defences that religion of which the weapons are not carnal, and whose kingdom is not of this world."—Arnold's "Life of Macaulay," pp. 123, 124.

This is not only good logic, but heavenly truth as well. For a state or civil power of any rank to dictate how one may exercise his divine right of worship, is an unwarrantable infringement of that which is wholly another's. By doing so it assumes that the permission to worship God is dependent on a grant from the civil government. But if the civil power can confer such a right as a mark of favor, it can withhold that right without injustice. In that case no one could claim it as his right, but must receive it, if at all, as an absolute gift from the government.

There is much involved here. In the first place such an assumption puts the government in the place of God to every citizen, and leads all who obey its dictates into idolatry. It also destroys the right of private judgment and makes every one subject to the religious caprices of those who, for the time, happen to hold the reins of civil power; for it follows that if at any time one set of legislators frame regulations for forms of religious worship, their successors may modify or change those regulations for others better suited to their ideas of fitness. Thus all would become subject to a change of religious practice with every change of government.

This may be thought an extreme view of the case, but as ultra as it may seem, this was exactly what was done in the reigns succeeding that of Henry VIII of England. Under the governments of Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth, Protestant and Catholic religions alternated as the spiritual law of the realm, and all subjects were required to change their form of worship to meet the demand of the reigning sovereign, or suffer punishment by the civil authorities.

No sane person would think of attempting so much in other matters than of religion. A man is little concerned about his neighbor's management of his estate. He does not legally interfere because his neighbor's methods of tilling land differ from his own. He would not think of applying to the courts for power to control the size and shape of a house being erected by another. In all secular things man enjoys the fullest liberty of private judgment, but when he attempts to exercise this right in matters pertaining to his highest joy here, and the fullness of bliss hereafter, some would seek to restrain and control his operations by legal process, because, forsooth, they are not just in harmony with his idea of doing such things. He himself has exercised his own judgment in deciding his religious practice, but is not willing to accord the same privilege to others. When unregenerated human nature controls the individual, how prone is he to lose sight of the Golden Rule: "As ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise." Luke 6:31.

There can be no logical reason given why men should not exercise the same right of judgment in religious, as in secular affairs. Was not man endowed of God with power of mind to observe, weigh, and make comparisons from which to draw conclusions? Is it possible for the mind to be enlightened without the exercise of these faculties? Can the average mind restrain such operation if it would?—Certainly not. Then what folly to think that one with strong convictions of religious preference could tamely yield that consciousness to an arbitrary statute, the product of minds with no higher endowment of discernment than his own. Such an one could well say with John Boyle O'Reilly:—

> "I care not for the outer voice
> That deals out praise or blame;
> I could not with the world rejoice,
> Nor bear its doom of shame;
> But when the voice within me speaks,
> The truth to me is known;
> He sees himself who inward seeks—
> The riches are his own."
