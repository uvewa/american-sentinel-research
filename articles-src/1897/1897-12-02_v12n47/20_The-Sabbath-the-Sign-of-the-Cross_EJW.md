Jesus says, "Come unto me, all ye that labor, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." Matt. 11:28. He gives rest because in him the works of God are perfect. "We are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works." "If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature." In him "we have our redemption, the forgiveness of sins, . . . for in him were all things created." Redemption through Christ is nothing else than creation—a new creation. Just before his crucifixion, Christ said to the Father, "I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do." John 17:4. And when he hung on the cross he cried, "It is finished; and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost." John 19:30. Thus he indicated that in the cross are to be found all the perfect, finished works of the new creation.

Now the Sabbath was given as the sign of a perfect creation completed; therefore it is the sign of those perfect works restored by the cross of Christ. That is to say, since the Sabbath is the sign of a perfect creation completed, and by the cross of Christ a new creation is accomplished, the Sabbath must be the sign of the cross. Try it and see if it is not.

## A GIFT, NOT A TASK EXACTED.

Here is where so many people mistake: they think that the Sabbath is a hard requirement that God lays on men, and then they soon get in the way of thinking that God cannot require it of us, since he does not desire his people to be burdened. But salvation is not a thing required of us, but a gift to us; and the Sabbath is the sign of Christ's saving power: he saves by the power by which he creates. Rest is not a burden, it is a pleasure. Nothing more absolutely delightful can be imagined than rest in the consciousness of work all done and well done, and this is the privilege of the people of God: "All thy works shall praise thee, O Lord, and thy saints shall bless thee. They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; to make known to the sons of men thy mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of thy kingdom." Ps. 145:10–12. "One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts." Verse 4.

The Sabbath is the pledge and assurance to us that the power by which the worlds were made has wrought good works for us in Christ, and that these works are all ours if we believe. This is the rest prepared for us from the foundation of the world.
