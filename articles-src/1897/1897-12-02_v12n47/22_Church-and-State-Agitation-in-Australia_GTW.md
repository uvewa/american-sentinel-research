### PROPOSED GOVERNMENTAL RECOGNITION OF THE DEITY.

**THE Australian Christian World**, of July 2, 1897, under the title, "Recognition of God," says:—

"The framers of the Constitution need not be irreverent, and the formal acknowledgment we ask for is simple and pious, and it may be simply and piously made."

This paper voices the sentiments of the Council of Churches in New South Wales, and it thus reveals the real wishes of many persons in the churches who are no doubt sincere in their desire to see God's name piously recognized in the Constitution and laws of the proposed Commonwealth.

But it is more than a mere "formal acknowledgment" that is asked for, as is evident from the expression, "It may be simply and piously made." The word "pious" has two definitions:—

First, "Godly; reverencing and honoring the Supreme Being in heart and in the practice of the duties he has enjoined;" second, "Practiced under the pretense of religion; as, pious frauds."

The recognition of God in the preamble of the Federal Constitution will give a religious coloring to the whole Constitution, and will make it possible to introduce religious legislation into the Federal Parliament a little later on after the Constitution has been adopted. The thing that is really desired by the class who appear so anxious for the acknowledgment of the Supreme Being in the Commonwealth Bill, is to enforce upon the citizens of federated Australia what they hold to be his law, or their interpretation of that law.

That this statement is true, one needs but to recall what the Council of Churches did recently in Sydney, when it sent a deputation to visit the acting premier, to get all the shops closed on Sunday by governmental authority. This very act on the part of the Council of Churches shows that the leaders in this movement would not stop with a mere "formal recognition of God" in the Constitution. It is a "reverent" and "pious" acknowledgment of God, according to their idea of what that means, that is desired. The enforcement of Sunday observance by law especially would be demanded.

Infatuated with the idea that the kingdom of Christ must "enter the realm of law through the gateway of politics," the religio-political reformers of to-day are turning from the heaven-appointed means for reforming men to the satanic agencies of force in religious matters. It has been the use of force which has brought persecution to dissenters in all ages. But force in matters of religion never made one true Christian. It has filled millions with a fear of ecclesiastical and civil penalties, and made many hypocrites, but it never made a Christian. The gospel draws the sinner by its own inherent power of love. It compels no one's will, but wins its way to the heart by its mercy and compassion.

God's way of reforming men is indicated in the following scriptures:—

"I beseech you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God." "I, Paul, myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ." "Exhort one another daily, while it is called to-day." "As though God did beseech you by us, we pray you, in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God."

Such is the tenor of the Scriptures all the way through. We are to beseech, entreat, exhort, persuade, and constrain men by the love of God, but not to force any one. It is all to be done in the manner set forth in the Golden Rule: "As ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise." Duke 6:31. Love is that secret cord by which the Infinite One draws the souls of men to Christ for salvation. This is evident from many passages. The Lord says to the sinner, "I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with loving-kindness have I drawn thee. Jer. 31:3. "I healed them; I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love." Hosea 11:3, 4.

The Lord does not put upon us any grievous yoke. He does not force us into his service. He invites us to come. "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." He takes off the grievous yoke that the compulsory service of sin has imposed and sets us free that we may render to him voluntary service. He says: "And I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them." Hosea 11:4. And he tells his people that they too should "break every yoke" and "let the oppressed go free." Isaiah 58. This is the gospel way. This is God's way, the way of mercy and love.

Christ said to Peter, "Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword." Matt. 26:52. Our Saviour used no outward force to gain followers, and he asked no armies to help his disciples to carry on the gospel after his ascension. He told them that they should be witnesses for him after they should receive power from on high; but Jesus plainly taught that his kingdom is not of this world, and that therefore his servants do not fight. John 18:36.

Why, then, do many of Christ's professed followers seek to use the very means which he condemned? Let him answer it. He says, "If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; . . . but all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me. . . . They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service: And these things will they do unto you because they have not known the Father, nor me." John 15:20, 21; 16:2, 3. This is the reason why professed Christians persecute the true children of God; they are not acquainted with either Christ or his Father. Persecutors know only Satan's gospel of force, and that is why they want the aid of the civil law to back up their church practices and religious forms, and it does not require any change of heart to do this. A formal recognition of God in a civil constitution comports very well with a mere outward profession of religion.

True religion is a matter of heart service to God, begotten of love, not fear, for fear has only torment. Such a recognition enters into all the social and business relations of life. He who makes it ever remembers that his Maker sees him, and that he must render account to God for all his acts. It is a matter of personal faith toward God. The Scriptures declare that "without faith it is impossible to please him; for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him." Heb. 11:6. "Whatsoever is not of faith is sin." Rom. 14:23. Then if any recognition of God is not a matter of personal faith in God on the part of the individual who makes it, it is sin.

The church has never yet joined hands with the civil power to enforce religious practices without soiling its garments, corrupting the state, and bringing disgrace upon the church and opprobrium upon the very name of religion through the persecution of godly men and women, under the garb of piety. Let all consider what such a union means.
