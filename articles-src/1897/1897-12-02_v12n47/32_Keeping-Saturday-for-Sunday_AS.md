"Good evening. Please come in and accept a seat near the fire, as it's a little chilly to-night," said Mr. Wilson, as he opened his door in response to the knock of our friends James and Johnny. "What can I do for you, my boys?"

"We have called," said Johnny, "to buy a few peaches. We heard that you have them for sale."

"I am sure, boys, that you intended no wrong in asking to buy some at this time. As it is the Sabbath, I cannot sell you any, but you are welcome to what you wish to eat."

"Excuse us, please, Mr. Wilson, for calling. We thought you kept Saturday for Sunday, but this is Friday night."

"We do not, my boys. Saturday is made of a part each of the seventh and first days of the week. Saturday will commence to night at midnight, but the seventh day of the week, which is the Sabbath, commenced an hour ago at sunset, and will end to-morrow at sunset, about six hours before Saturday ends."

"Well, we never understood that before; but what makes you keep the seventh day, Mr. Wilson?"

"Here is my Bible; read the commandment for yourself in the twentieth chapter of Exodus."

"O, you do just as the Lord tells you to, then, don't you? It's queer how our folks can read that commandment and say it means Sunday, when they own that Sunday is the first day of the week. Well, good evening, Mr. Wilson, we must be going. We will call some other day."

"Wasn't it too bad, Jim, about their sending Mr. Wilson to work in the chain-gang with a lot of bad men, and all because he dug a few potatoes in his own field on Sunday? It was Ed Day's father, that boiled maple sap on Sunday, who swore out a complaint against Mr. Wilson. He said his minister wanted him to."

"I say 'Sunday law' to you! I don't believe it's right anyway. As Mr. Wilson says, Sunday isn't the first day of the week any more than Saturday is the seventh. Most all those church members, and ministers too, will work from Saturday at sunset, sometimes till midnight, and then fine folks for working on the rest of the day which they call Sunday. I met a man the other day who was selling books, and he told me that Sunday used to be the heathen Sabbath when folks worshiped the sun, and that was why it was called sun day. If I keep any day as the Sabbath, I'd rather keep the one God tells me to."

"And so would I. Good-bye."

A. Smith.
