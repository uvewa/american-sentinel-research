The propriety of the agitation made by the SENTINEL for the separation of religion and the state is shown by many incidents in the volume of current events. One of these is mentioned by the Washington (D. C.) Post of the 18th inst., thus:—

"Joseph Bradfield filed a petition in the District Supreme Court yesterday praying for an order to restrain Ellis H. Roberts, treasurer of the United States, from paying to the directors of Providence Hospital [a sectarian institution] any money out of the treasury belonging to the United States or to the District of Columbia, upon and by virtue of an agreement or contract entered into between the surgeon general of the United States army and the directors of Providence Hospital, or on account of an agreement made with the directors by the District of Columbia."

The impropriety of appropriating public funds for sectarian uses generally has to be argued in the courts before it is admitted by the parties seeking the appropriation.
