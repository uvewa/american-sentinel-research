ABOUT a year and a half ago, the "Coöperative Sunday Association of Alabama" was organized at Montgomery, the capital city, as an auxiliary to the American Sabbath Union. (See AMERICAN SENTINEL, March 5, 1896.)

Since then active work has been put forth to create public sentiment in its favor throughout the State. Yet no decisive step was taken until recently in Birmingham, the second city in the State, or including its many suburbs, even the first in population.

A mass meeting was called to consider the "better preservation and rightful observance of the Sabbath." This was held on the night of November 8, at the First Presbyterian church. About twenty people were present, and at least six of these were pastors, but the "Jefferson County Sabbath Association" was started on its career, as a branch of the State association.

Several speeches were made in which were many significant statements. The prominent thought was that the religious forces must combine, and make an irresistible attack upon the legislature for more stringent laws in behalf of Sunday observance. One speaker had learned only recently, by examining the civil code, that Alabama had practically no Sunday law, as the provisions touched only a few of the many ways in which Sunday was being desecrated. One church could not engage successfully in this work. It would require the union of all interested forces. This is a work which Catholics will join with the various Protestant bodies. They did not expect any assistance from the Jews, nor from the seventh-day Christians, neither did they ask it; but the latter especially were too insignificant in numbers to amount to anything.

The Sunday law was upheld from a civil standpoint, but many statements revealed its religious foundation. The Sunday newspapers should be abolished, because of keeping people from church and filling their minds with secular thoughts. The fruit-stands and confectioneries should close because they tempt children to spend their pennies and nickels on the way to Sunday-school. The furnaces, railroads, etc., should stop work, because they keep many from serving God and attending church who would like to do so.

They seem to have lost sight of the power of the gospel, which is able to reform men and cause them to obey God despite all obstacles, though it involve the loss of position or all worldly possessions, even the sacrifice of life itself. But their purpose is to get laws passed to make it easy for people to serve God, or at least to appear to do so.

The majority of the officers chosen were men who were not present, but whose influence was desired to give strength to the movement. In selecting vice-presidents, there was some question whether a certain minister named was in sympathy with the movement. It was stated that his influence was second to no minister in Alabama when it came to politics. He had recently taken the lead in a strong and successful move upon the legislature against horse-racing and pools. They ran the risk, and accepted his name. If the doubts mentioned are correct, it is to be hoped that this minister will have the courage of his convictions, and sever his connection with this religio-political organization. At the organization of the State Association, some of the Montgomery pastors took a firm, decided stand against the effort to secure Sunday observance by law.

The new organization expects to enter upon an active campaign, and, as one of the daily papers recently stated, the Sunday question is rapidly becoming the "issue of the hour:"—

"A fortnight ago it was a nebulous fleck on the horizon. To-day it is a portentous cloud; with enough electricity within its folds to blast many a promising political career. It is going to figure in the county campaign, principally in the election of members of the legislature. The municipal election is a long ways off, but if this Sunday question is not settled between now and then, it will be the pivotal point of the campaign."

Then, after speaking of the movements of the contending forces, the same article concludes:—

"These preliminary skirmishes are full of significance to the keen observer. They forecast a pitched battle, that is only a question of time."

Two weeks ago, some eight or nine saloon men were arrested in this city for cleaning up their bars and premises in the early hours of Sunday morning. They were all dismissed, but, as indicated, this is only a skirmish preceding the conflict that is inevitable.

This is the golden opportunity to place the true principles of religious liberty and the evils of religious legislation before the people of this community, and the time will be improved by those who are awake to the situation. O that the people everywhere would sense the danger that is threatening the whole land from the spirit of religious intolerance that is gathering like a tempest, soon to burst upon the heads of those who cannot yield their consciences to the dictation of men. "We ought to obey God rather than men."

Birmingham, Ala.
