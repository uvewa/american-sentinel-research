The late Henry George, who died in the midst of his campaign for the mayoralty of Greater New York, was a philanthropist and a philosopher, and now that he is dead a most generous meed of praise is being bestowed upon him both by those who were with him in the political contest and those who were against him. In one of his speeches, delivered the last day of his life, he made the following statement which deserves to be perpetuated among the recorded sayings of the wisest men of the world:—

"I believe that God, the Father, can take care of his own laws; there is no need for us to gain trouble trying to meddle with God's laws—to enforce them."

If this suggestion were carried out, the Sunday laws which now disgrace the statute books of nearly all the States of the United States would be eliminated, and the persecution which they are sometimes made to authorize would be unknown. The whole conception of all Sunday laws starts in the thought that God requires Sunday rest in honor of himself. He requires nothing of the kind; and if he did, he would not have his laws which relate to his worship enforced by corrupt governments of earth.

Can earthly governments say to any man "Thou shalt have no other god but God?" Can they search the hearts of men for hatred, lust, envy, and pride and prescribe the penalty?

How, then, can they tell whether a man keeps the Sabbath or not? Idleness is not Sabbath-keeping; but to command idleness is all that the law can do toward commanding Sabbath-keeping! How can such laws be pleasing to God or beneficial to men?
