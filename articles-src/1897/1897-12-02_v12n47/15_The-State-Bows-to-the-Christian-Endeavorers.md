RECENTLY the state officials who are in charge of the work of constructing the capitol building at Albany, which work has been in progress seven days in the week, were visited by representatives of the Christian Endeavor Society and told that Sunday work on the building must stop; and—the work stopped.

There is a law in New York against Sunday work, and of this law these State officials were certainly aware; but to the law they paid no attention. But when the Christian Endeavor Society—a religious organization powerful in numbers and influence—told them that Sunday work under their charge must stop, they at once became obedient to the law.

Will some one tell us what there is in this other than an act of homage by the State to this religious society? What is there in it but an acknowledgment by the State that its own laws are less to be honored than the mandate of this church organization?

What, then, in the logical order of things, is there to hinder the society of Christian Endeavor from governing the State, and through that the people of the state? Where now is the real seat of civil authority in the State of New York?
