A question which has arisen in connection with the flag salute which has become a feature of the exercises in some of the public schools, as noticed last week, is that of what constitutes loyalty to country. It appears that a refusal to salute the flag in the manner prescribed, is quite apt to be taken as justifying a charge of treason against the objector.

***

There is a legal definition of treason, but this can hardly be applied to the circumstances under consideration. In a general sense, it will no doubt be acknowledged that treason can only be that which tends to the destruction of one's country, and that nothing which tends to its prosperity can rightfully be called by that name. But, determined from this standpoint, many individuals appear as traitors who by reason of prevailing sentiments and conditions, have been able to pose before the people as patriots, and who were even persuaded that they were such in their own minds. History is acquainted with many individuals of this class.

We might go back to ancient times to find an illustration upon this point. In the reign of Ahab, king of Israel, there was great distress upon the land by reason of a three years' drought, sent by the Lord upon the people because of their apostasy from him. For this apostasy King Ahab was himself responsible, having set the example in it and promoted it by the decrees of the kingdom. But when at last Ahab met Elijah, the prophet of the Lord, he exclaimed, "Art thou he that troubleth Israel?" He accused Elijah of being a traitor to the realm; when the truth was that he himself was a traitor, because by his course he had brought the country to the brink of ruin.

Napoleon is not generally regarded as a traitor to France. On the contrary, he is honored by the French nation as one of their greatest heroes. But what did he do for France? He sacrificed her treasure and the lives of many thousands of her people upon the altar of his ambition. He brought the armed hosts of the enemy to the gates of Paris, and the country itself to the brink of ruin. No traitor ever did more than this, in his efforts to serve himself at his country's expense.

It is not always the man who is most ready to go to war that has the best interests of his country at heart. It is not always the person that calls most loudly for the government to resent by force of arms some real or fancied insult, who is doing most for his country's real good. It is easy to be filled with enthusiasm over the prospect of demonstrating our national prowess upon the traditional field of glory, with very little thought of the ruin and misery that must inevitably come upon the country as the result. This country has not yet recovered from the ruinous effects of its great Civil War. Remembering the terse definition of Gen. W. T. Sherman, that "war is hell," it must be admitted that there is a belligerent sort of "patriotism" which is itself of the nature of treason, seeking as it does to plunge the country into needless war.

There can be no question but that whatever tends to promote peace, and respect for right and justice, tends to promote the highest welfare of the country; and the life that is devoted to this end, cannot by any shadow of right bear the stigma of treason. And therefore the Christian cannot justly be regarded as a traitor to the land of his birth or residence, since the Christian life tends only to promote peace on earth and good-will among men. It tends only to promote those conditions under which the highest national prosperity is attainable.

Yet the Christian may refuse to do that of which popular sentiment approves; and because of this he may be stigmatized as a traitor. But he does this knowing that allegiance to God means always allegiance to the best interests of the community and the country in which he lives. He refuses to make the state his god by giving to it instead of to God his supreme allegiance; but he knows that he can best serve the state not by turning away from God, but by remaining a worshiper of him. The three Hebrew worthies of old refused to worship the state of Babylon in the form of Nebuchadnezzar's great image; yet the state had no more faithful servants than they, and the king afterward recognized this fact by promoting them to a higher station in the province of Babylon.

No persons honor more than do Christians the just principles of government for which the flag of stars and stripes is supposed to stand. As the ensign of freedom it is worthy of all honor. But the flag itself has been prostituted to the uses of despotism. For as a keen observer of events has said:—

> "Knaves have stolen thee, Old Glory,
> For their Babylonian bowers;
> O'er their festal halls and towers
> Floats the flag that once was ours;
> O'er their crimes thy beauty trails,
> And the old-time answer fails
> When from chain-gangs, courts, and jails,
> Men appeal to thee, Old Glory!"

In the "flag salute" of which we have spoken, "Old Glory" is made a party to a proceeding which invades the rights of conscience; and Christians must therefore refuse to become participants in it. And they do this in the name of conscience, of honesty, and of the rights of man and of God. And in so doing they manifest, not treason, but allegiance to the foundation principles upon which this great Republic was established.
