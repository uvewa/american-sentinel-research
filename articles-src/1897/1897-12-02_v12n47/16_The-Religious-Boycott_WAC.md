AT the Christian Endeavor convention held in Perth, West Australia, September 8, a resolution was passed by which the members present pledged themselves to refrain from doing business with men who do not observe Sunday. Thus in Australia, as in America and other professedly Christian countries, the religious boycott is being advocated by professed Christians as a means of inducing men to observe the Sunday institution. And ere long we may expect the long foretold decree to go forth, that "no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name." Rev. 13:16, 17.

Evidently the Sunday institution is the mark here referred to. It is the mark of the beast, the spurious Sabbath which the papacy has put in the place of the Sabbath of the Lord; and professed Protestants are seeking to enforce it by the boycott, which in plain language means, Come to our terms or we will starve you out. In what contrast is such a course to the command, "If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink." Rom. 12:20.
