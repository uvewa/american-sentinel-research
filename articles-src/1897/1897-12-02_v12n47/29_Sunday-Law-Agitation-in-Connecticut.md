It appears that the church people of Connecticut, and the Congregationalists in particular, are not satisfied with the present Sunday law of that State, and want a new and more stringent one enacted. This became one of the chief topics of discussion at the late Congregationalist Conference at Bridgeport, and steps were taken to secure a concession to this end from the legislature. The Banbury News, of November 24, gives the following report of the procedure of the conference upon this point:—

"The legislative committee threw aside the draft of a law submitted by Rev. Mr. Hall, Lawyer G. H. Newton, of New Haven, and other gentlemen of a committee appointed by the Congregational Conference at Winsted in the fall of 1896, and substituted a law which only slightly amended the old Sunday law, making it less restrictive in its prohibition, but increasing the penalties.

"During the conference proceedings, Tuesday afternoon, Lawyer Newton, a delegate from New Haven, secured the floor, and spoke on the subject of Sunday laws in general. He advocated the cessation of all work on the Sabbath which was not absolutely necessary for the health, comfort, and reasonable enjoyment of the day. The day ought not to be so observed that it would keep people from the churches. The law had been so changed by the influence of the church that the saloons in nearly if not all towns were practically closed on the Sabbath, and he thought the church had done a good work to bring this about. He held that if it is necessary to keep the markets open for the Sunday meals because the people cannot afford to maintain refrigerators, then let these be open at a time that will not in any manner interfere with the church. He could not see why certain work had to be done on Sunday, or, at least, was done, that could be done on any other day.

"He advocated the appointment of a committee of five to frame a Sunday law to present to the next general assembly that would be so clear and concise and so satisfactory to the masses of church-going people and law-abiding citizens, that it will be readily passed and rigidly enforced. He believed in calling to their assistance in this respect the Catholics and Hebrews, and, in fact, all organizations outside of the church, as he believed the honorable people outside the church desired a practical Sunday law that would be observed and one that would be a credit to this commonwealth.

"Some discussion followed in which several speakers were in favor of leaving the Sunday law as it is at present. A vote was taken and the resolution for the appointment of a committee to frame a new Sunday law was adopted."
