What is known is sure; therefore be tolerant. There is much to be discovered; be therefore twice tolerant. For want of this diffidence and modesty certain great persons in the past—such as Reformers and Puritans—were not by any means tolerant, were indeed filled at times with the spirit of persecution. They were very much convinced of truth, and were also certain they had all truth, and so fell into an arrogant and insolent temper, whose influence has not quite departed from their children.—Rev. John Watson.
