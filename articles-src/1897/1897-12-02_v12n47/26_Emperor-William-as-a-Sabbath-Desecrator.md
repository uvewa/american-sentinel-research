Recently Emperor William gave a big hunting party at Romitan, in East Prussia, on a Sunday, whereupon the Consistory of the Lutheran (state) Church of that province passed a unanimous vote of censure upon the Kaiser for having "desecrated the Sabbath." Under Emperor William's sanction, stringent Sunday laws have been enacted in Germany, to which the state church now has the audacity to hold the Kaiser amenable. But the latter probably reflects that, as representing the state, he is at least on an equal footing with the church in their alliance; and that if Sabbath observance is merely a matter of state regulation, it is no great sin for a kaiser to observe it about as he pleases. That is the natural result of regulating Sabbath observance by state law.
