On the question of teaching religion in the state schools, and in reference to some features of the agitation for it, Sir George Turner, Premier of Victoria, Australia, in a recent speech, made the following pertinent remarks:—

"If religious teaching is to be any good, it must be doctrinal teaching, and it must be given by somebody who has studied and who understands the work."

"If all the leaders of denominations would meet and agree among themselves as to the lessons they desire to have taught, that would clear the ground of much of the difficulty; but I think if we got them together they would be something like the Kilkenny cats."

"If you had read some of the letters I have had to read about the matter, and had heard some of the sermons I have heard about it, you would see that it is not mere religious instruction in state schools of the kind asked for which is wanted. That would be the introduction merely of the thin end of the wedge."

"I regret very much the proceedings which have been taken by those who are leading this movement. You are asked to pledge yourselves to vote against me at the next elections if I have conscientious scruples against this platform. You are asked to pledge yourselves against every man who will not vote for the introduction of these books. Is that fair? Is it a fair way of obtaining a test vote on the question? I am surprised that those who attempt to lead Christian society are capable of adopting such tactics."

All of which applies forcibly to the situation which exists to-day in the United States.
