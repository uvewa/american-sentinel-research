At least one member of the Wisconsin legislature has received a communication from the "Superintendent of Christian Citizenship" of the City of Racine, giving him the following information:

"Arrangements have been made whereby the record of each legislator during this coming season will be forwarded to our superintendent of Christian Citizenship and he will make it his business to see that your constituents know of your record in this legislature; therefore it is to your interest as well as theirs to see that your record is kept clear and above all comment. We assure you that we do this with an object of aiding you as well as the cause we champion.

Respectfully yours,

G. C. HARNEY,
*Supt. of Christian Citizenship.*

The *Daily Advocate*, of Green Bay, Wis., says that the gentleman whom it refers to as having received this letter, "interpreted the letter as a threat, as indeed would most people, and he lost no time in replying: at the same time pointing out to Mr. Harney the impertinence which characterized the letter he had written."

It is perfectly plain that these mis-called Christian Citizenship managers are determined to work themselves into places as regular political bosses, and run the governments of States and the nation solely in the interests of what they choose to hold as Christian. They will never stop till they make the religious power dominate the civil as thoroughly as ever it did in Puritan times or the Middle Ages.
