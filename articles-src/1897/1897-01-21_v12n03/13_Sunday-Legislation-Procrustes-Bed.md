A PROMINENT speaker at the recent compulsory Sunday observance convention in Chicago, said:

"It has been the immemorial custom of our courts and legislatures to follow precedents, and from materials collected from the effete past, from decisions rendered and statutes enacted when the conditions of society were wholly different from what they are under our newer civilization, to construct Procrustes beds upon which they seek to stretch the great issue of the present, chopping, cramping and straining them as mercilessly as did the legendary giant of Athens his fated victims. In this case the victim resists, and thereupon occurs a struggle between the hoary Procrustes of Conservatism and the youthful giant of Progress."

This was not intended to describe the descent of Sunday legislation from the Church-and-State regimes of antiquity, and its conflict with the spirit of liberty and progress to-day; but it could not possibly apply to anything more perfectly.
