This new phrase, "Christian Citizenship," is now claiming the field of discussion. To some it seems to present the remedy for all the great evils which threaten our national, social, and personal welfare. To others it appears to be the germ which, cultivated to a successful growth, will constitute an evil more far-reaching and destructive to the individual, society, and the nation, than any of the present or past evils which have stricken our political institutions with the mildew of corruption.

"Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed." This being true, governments can justly exercise no power except derived-power. This nation of ours is a "government of the people, by the people, and for the people." Thus the people themselves are the Government.

This can properly be expressed in other words thus: The people acting together as a government, can exercise no power except what they have, as single individuals, consented to place at the disposal of the mass. The consent of the governed is expressed in the capacity of single individuals, by the exercise of the right of franchise in voting. In this way the individuals indicate what measures they favor, and pledge what power they have to carry them out. At the same time perhaps, and in the same way, they choose agents to accomplish their governmental desires.

The citizen as an individual thus gives his consent to the government, and the government in this way derives power or authority to act. What is termed an officer of government, only has a right to execute the will of the people expressed in the vote. If in attempting to do this as an agent, he finds it will not succeed because threatened by some element of discontent or the invasion of some foreign foe, he has a right to call upon the people who have exercised the power of franchise, in making him their executive, to make their pledges good by a strong police force, or an army sufficiently clothed with the real element of governmental power, which is the sword, to quell the disturbance or repel the invasion.

The governed can only delegate, pledge, or consent to furnish, to the government, physical power. That is the only power ever employed by civil government. In fact all the power that is needed in civil affairs is power to compel uncivil men to be civil.

But after a man becomes a Christian, he has two kinds of power—spiritual and physical. Can both become elements in his "citizenship"?

As the "citizenship" is the original factor and basis of civil government, and really constitutes it, whatever elements make up the citizenship determines the kind of government. The elements of citizenship are simply those represented in the power delegated to the government.

Otherwise there would be injustice. To illustrate: If Christianity were an element in citizenship and yet was to be controlled by the government without being derived from the consent of the governed, this would not be just; because "governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed."

If the government were to exercise authority with respect to Christianity without its being recognized as an element in citizenship nor derived through the consent of the citizens, this would be again to abandon the principle and exercise unjust power because not derived from the consent of the governed.

If Christianity were an element in earthly citizenship and delegated to the government yet not dominated by governmental power, then the government would be guilty of neglecting one of its functions, and violating the trust imposed in it.

Finally: Suppose, as the advocates of "Christian Citizenship" assume, that Christianity is an element in citizenship, and that it is delegated to the government, and the government does administer it. Then the responsibility is shifted from the individual to the nation: and instead of looking to God as the object of worship and obedience, as well as trust and confidence, he looks to the government. And this would be unchristian; because God has definitely forbidden it—"Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help." Ps. 146:3.
