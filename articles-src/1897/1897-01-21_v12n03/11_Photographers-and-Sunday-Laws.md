The photographers of Michigan are following the example of the barbers, and are calling for a special act of the legislature closing picture galleries on Sunday. The Michigan Christian Advocate, Jan. 16, 1897, says: "We do not consider such an act necessary." And further remarks that "All these men have to do is to shut up shop." Good. That is the very thing the AMERICAN SENTINEL has been saying all the time to every call for any kind of a Sunday law. The words of the Advocate are just as true of every kind of a movement for a Sunday law, as they are of this one. We only hope all the Advocates and all other papers and people will take this position and stand there forever.
