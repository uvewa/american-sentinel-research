"If religion is in itself inviolable, it is so no longer when it has ended in a true political society, a corporation which is owner of a portion of the soil. As such, it falls under the power of the State, . . . and its independence decreases in proportion to its political importance, except the government of society should quickly pass into its hands. That which is political in its constitution naturally subjects it to the fluctuations of opinion on the best organization of the State."—De Pressensé.
