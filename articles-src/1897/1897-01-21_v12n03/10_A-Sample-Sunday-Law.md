The New Orleans Times-Democrat, of Jan. 3, 1897, publishes a list of regulations in force in that city a little less than one hundred years ago, which had "for their object the maintenance of good order and tranquility" in the community; among which we note the following:

1. All persons, of whatsoever class, who, under any pretext whatever, will have the audacity to blaspheme the name of God our Lord, the Virgin Mary, our Lady, or sacred things, or make use of threatening oaths, will incur the penalties established by the laws of these kingdoms. All workmen or artisans, without exception, of whatever class or profession it may be, who will be convicted of having worked on Sunday or a holy day, during which one can only attend to work in cases of necessity by especial permission, will be sentenced to a fine of $10, or if he is insolvent, to six days' imprisonment; and his employer will pay double the amount.

"It is prohibited under penalty of twenty-four hours' imprisonment, to run carts on holy days and Sundays."

Another section provides that "billiard rooms must not be opened on Holy Days until after the High Mass."

Of course, "good order and tranquility" are very essential things in any community, and it must devolve upon the civil authorities to maintain them. This is the alleged ground of justification for all Sunday laws, and it is just as good justification for this particular Sunday law as for any other that was ever passed.

This law bears the stamp, it is true, of having been passed in the interests of the Roman Catholic religion; but what of that? All Sunday laws bear the stamp of some religion; for it is only religion which gives Sunday a distinction from other days of the week. Is there any choice to be made between a Roman Catholic Sunday law and a Methodist, Baptist, or Presbyterian Sunday law? Have not Roman Catholics an equal right with all others in this respect?

The fact that this Roman Catholic Sunday law prohibited work on other "holy" days than Sundays, only shows the ultimate state of things to which Sunday legislation leads. The Roman Catholic Church was the pioneer church in Sunday legislation, and her legislation with respect to "holy days" rests upon the same foundation as that pertaining to Sunday. Both are justified by the same logic. Sunday is itself only a "holy day;" and if work can properly be prohibited on one such day, it can properly be forbidden on all.

If "good order and tranquility" can be promoted by enforcing idleness on one "holy day," they can be promoted by the same means on all such days. And assuredly good order and tranquility ought to be promoted at all times.

It may be doubted, of course, whether enforced idleness is at all conducive to good order and tranquility. The facts of experience do not testify that way. But as Sunday legislation must be enacted by the civil authorities, if at all, some way must be found to justify it upon civil grounds. Hence we have Sunday laws along with laws against blaspheming "the Virgin Mary, our Lady," to preserve "good order and tranquility," and also as "sanitary measures," to promote the public health, etc. It would be safe to say that religious legislation is as justifiable upon the one ground as on the other.

The fact that the religio-political forces of the country are already engaged in the work of manufacturing "holy" days out of the national holidays, only adds to the evidence that their zeal for Sunday legislation will lead them in the same path taken by Rome. So that it is altogether likely that ere long the American nation will have attained to the point of progress and civilized enlightenment occupied by New Orleans under Spanish domination near one hundred years ago!
