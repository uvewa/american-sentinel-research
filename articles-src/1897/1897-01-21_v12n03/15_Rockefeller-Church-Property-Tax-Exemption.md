There is a contest in this city over a piece of church property, in which Mr. John D. Rockefeller is one of the principals. The case was in court the other day, and in Mr. Rockefeller's testimony the following passage occurred:

"Who was the real owner of the lease obtained from the St. Mark's Church?"

"I was," he answered.

"But it was held in the name of the church: why was that?"

"The reason for that," replied Mr. Rockefeller, "was to escape taxation. If I had held the lease in my name the property would have been taxed. If the church held it, it was exempt from taxation."

This is an illustration of one of the many evils of exempting church property from taxation. Here was one of the richest men in the world, a professed Christian too, who was the real owner of a lease on property; but to escape taxation the false pretense was made of holding the lease in the name of a church. And other testimony showed that the church management was a party to the trick.

The case was tried before Justice Pryor, who a short time ago refused a certificate of incorporation to a society whose annual meetings were to be held the last day of each year, because such meetings would thus sometimes fall on Sunday. He did not at once formally decide the case, but said that from what he could remember of it he should say that "Mr. Rockefeller's part has been purely a benevolent one and will receive due recognition before a higher forum than this"!

But Justice Pryor's "forum" decides questions of religion and men's relation thereto; and how can there be a higher forum than that? Yet though he recognizes a higher forum than his, it is to his mind such a one that he is satisfied that the "benevolence" of a man who resorts to a legal trick to show it "will receive due recognition" there. We wonder where that forum is.
