In view of the loud demand that the Turkish Government shall be wiped off the earth, the following dispatch to the New York Herald tells an interesting story:

"Constantinople, Jan. 10, 1897.—Official advices received here from Jerusalem show that there has been further trouble among the worshipers at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. It appears that the Roman Catholics were opposed to members of the Orthodox Greek Church entering the church by a certain door on the eve of January 6, the day observed by the Orthodox Church as Christmas.

"The latter insisted upon their right to enter, and the result was that the two factions became involved in a serious fight, which did not end until the Turkish authorities intervened to restore order. Some of the combatants were badly injured, but it is not known whether anybody was killed."

Is it not rather a happy circumstance that the Turkish power does exist in order that these devout "worshipers" may be kept from tearing one another to pieces in "orthodox style" at "the Church of the Holy Sepulchre"?
