As might be expected, so monstrous a fiction as that 'Christianity is part of the common law' did not have its birth in any legitimate way. It started as a "judicial forgery;" but once set going, was adopted and fostered by English judges of the times until it attained full legal growth, and has been bequeathed to our own time as a genuine thing. No less an American and legal authority than Thomas Jefferson has exposed this fraud, and his statement leaves it without any cloak for its true character. Jefferson's words on this point are contained in a letter dated at Monticello, June 5, 1824, written to Major John Cartwright, then of London. Referring to a volume which the latter had sent him on the English Constitution, Mr. Jefferson said:—

"I was glad to find in your book a formal contradiction at length of the judiciary usurpation of legislative powers; for such the judges have usurped in their repeated decisions that Christianity is a part of the common law. The proof of the contrary which you have adduced is incontrovertible. . . . But it may amuse you to learn when and by what means they stole this in upon us. . . . Here I might defy the best-read lawyer to produce one scrip of authority for this judicial forgery; and I might go on further to show how some of the Anglo-Saxon priests interpolated into the text of Alfred's laws the 20th, 21st, 22nd, and 23rd chapter of Exodus, and the 13th of the Acts of the Apostles, from the 23d to the 29th verses. But this would lead my pen and your patience too far. What a conspiracy between Church and State!"

Of the occasion of this judicial forgery, and the use made of it by the English jurists, Jefferson says:—

"In *Quare impedit* in C. B. H. 6, fo. 38, the defendant Bishop of Lincoln pleads that the church of the plaintiff became vacant by the death of the incumbent; that the plaintiff and I. S. each pretending a right, presented two clerks; that the church being thus rendered litigious, he was not obliged by the ecclesiastical law to admit either until an inquisition *de jure patronatus* in the ecclesiastical court; that by the same law this inquisition was to be at the suit of either claimant, and was not *ex-officio* to be instituted by the Bishop and at his proper costs; that neither party had desired such an inquisition; that six months passed, wherein it belonged to him of right to present, as on a lapse, which he had done. The plaintiff demurred. A question was, how far the ecclesiastical law was to be respected in this matter by the common law court. And Prisot (c. 5.) in the course of his argument uses this expression: 'A tels leis que ils de seint eglise ont en ancien scripture, convient à nous à donner credence; car ceo common ley sur quel tonts manners leis sont fonde s.' . . . Finch mis-states this in the following manner: 'To such laws of the church as have warrant in *Holy Scripture* our law gives credence,' and cites the above case and the words of Prisot in the margin. (Finch's law. B. I. c. 3. published 1613.) Here we find *ancien scripture* converted into *Holy Scripture*, whereas it can only mean the ancient written laws of the church. It cannot mean the Scriptures: 1st. Because the term *ancient scripture* must then be understood as meaning the *Old Testament* in contra-distinction to the *New*, and to the exclusion of that, which would be absurd and contrary to the wish of those who cited this passage to prove that the scriptures, or *Christianity*, is a part of the common law. 2nd. Because Prisot says 'ceo (est) Common ley sur quels tonts manner leis sont fondes.' Now it is true that the ecclesiastical law, so far as admitted in England, derives its authority from the common law. But it would not be true that the Scriptures so derive their authority. 3rd. The whole case and arguments show that the question was, how far the ecclesiastical law in general should be respected in a common law court. And in Bro's Abr. of this case Littleton says, 'les juges del Common ley pren-dra conusans quid est lex ecclesie vel admiralitates et hujus modi?' 4th. Because the particular part of the ecclesiastical law then in question, viz.: the right of the patron to present to his advowson, was not founded on the law of God, but subject to the modification of the law-giver, and so could not introduce any such general position as Finch pretends. Yet Wingate (in 1658) thinks proper to erect this quotation into a maxim of the common law, expressing it in the very words of Finch but citing Prisot. Wingate, Max. 3. Next comes Sheppard (in 1675) who states it in the same words of Finch and quotes Y. B., Finch and Wingate. 3. Shep. Arb. tit. Religion.

### NO AUTHORITY.

"In the case of King and Taylor, Sir Matthew Hale lays it down in these words: 'Christianity is parcel of the laws of England.' (I. Ventr. 293. 3. Keb. 607.) But he quotes no authority. It was from this part of the supposed common law that he derived his authority for burning witches. So strong was this doctrine become in 1728 by additions and repetitions from one another that in the case of The King v. Woolston the court would not suffer it to be debated, whether to write against Christianity was punishable in the temporal courts at common law, saying it had been settled in Taylor's case, ante, 2 stra. 834. Therefore Wood in his Institutes, lays it down that all blasphemy and profaneness are offenses by the common law, and cites Strange, ubi supra, Wood, 409. And Blackstone (about 1763) repeats, in the words of Sir Matthew Hale, that 'Christianity is part of the laws of England,' citing Ventr. and Str. ubi supra, 4. Bl. 59.

Lord Mansfield qualified a little by saying, in the case of the Chamberlain of London v. Evans, 1767, that 'The essential principles of revealed religion are part of the common law.' But he cites no authority and leaves us at our peril to find out what in the opinion of the judge, and according to the measure of his foot or his faith, are those essential principles of revealed religion, obligatory on us as a part of the common law. Thus we find this string of authorities, when examined at the beginning, all hanging on the same hook, a perverted expression of Prisot's, or on nothing, for they all quote Prisot, or one another, or nobody. Thus Finch quotes Prisot; Wingate also; Sheppard quotes Prisot, Finch, and Wingate. Hale cites nobody; the court in Wollston's case cites Hale. Wood cites Wollston's case; Blackstone that and Hale; and Lord Mansfield, like Hale, ventures it on his own authority.

"In the earlier ages of the law, as in the Year Books, for instance, we do not expect much recurrence to authorities by the judges, because in those days there were few or none such made public. But in later times we take no judge's word for what the law is further than he is warranted by the authorities he appeals to. His decision may bind the unfortunate individual who happens to be the particular subject of it, but it cannot alter the law.

"Although the common law be termed the *Léx non scripta*, yet the same Hale tells us: 'When I call those parts of our laws Leges non scripta, I do not mean as if all those laws were only oral, or communicated from the former ages to the latter merely by word. For all these laws have their several monuments in writing whereby they are transferred from one age to another, and without which they would soon lose all kind of certainty. They are for the most part extant in records of pleas, proceedings and judgments, in books of reports and judicial decisions, in tractates of learned men's arguments and opinions, preserved from ancient times and extant in writing.' (Hale's Common Law, 22.)

"Authorities for what is common law may, therefore, be as well cited as for any part of the *lex scripta*. And there is no better instance of the necessity of holding the judges and writers to a declaration of their authorities than the present, where we detect them endeavoring to make law where they found none and to submit us, at one stroke, to a whole system no particle of which has its foundation in common law, or has received the 'esto' of the legislator. For we know that the common law is that system of law which was introduced by the Saxons on their settlement in England, and altered from time to time by proper legislative authority from that to the date of the *Magna Charta*, which terminates the period of the common law or *léx non scripta* and commences that of the statute law or *lex scripta*. This settlement took place about the middle of the fifth century, the conversion of the first Christian king of the Heptarchy having taken place about the year 598, and that of the last about 686.

**CHRISTIANITY NO PART OF IT.**

"Here then was a space of two hundred years during which the common law was in existence and Christianity no part of it. If it ever, therefore, was adopted into the common law it must have been between the introduction of Christianity and the date of the *Magna Charta*. But of the laws of this period we have a tolerable collection by Lambard and Wilkins; probably not perfect, but neither very defective; and if any one chooses to build a doctrine on any law of that period, supposed to have been lost, it is incumbent on him to prove it to have existed and what were its contents. These were so far alterations of the common law and became themselves a part of it, but none of these adopt Christianity as a part of the common law.

"If therefore from the settlement of the Saxons to the introduction of Christianity among them that system of religion could not be a part of the common law, because they were not yet Christians; and if having their laws from that period to the close of the common law we are able to find among them no such act of adoption, we may safely affirm (though contradicted by all the judges and writers on earth) that Christianity neither is nor ever was a part of the common law."

The foregoing is only a part of Jefferson's argument, but sufficient for the purposes of this article. The full text is given as an Appendix to Jefferson's "Reports of Cases Determined in the General Court of Virginia, from 1730–1740, and from 1768–1772," published at Charlottesville, Va., by F. Carr and Co., 1829. His letter constitutes an effectual answer on the point in question, to the decision of the Supreme Court of New York in the case of The People vs. Ruggles, and of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in the case of Updegraff vs. The Commonwealth, rendered shortly before it was written, and frequently cited within recent years in support of laws for the enforcement of Sunday.

Upon a judicial forgery and a monstrous fiction utterly antagonistic to Christianity, therefore, rests Justice Pryor's statement constituting the basis of his decision, that "In the State of New York the sabbath exists as a day of rest by the common law."
