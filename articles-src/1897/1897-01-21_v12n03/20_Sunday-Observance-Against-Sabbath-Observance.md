Rabbi M. Samfield, Editor Jewish Spectator.

Motto: "Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty."

The evolution of the present Sunday law from the ecclesiastical institutions of the past has been amply proven, nor is there any doubt that the sole motive of its introduction into American State legislation was sectarian in its nature, and has as its object the rigid religious observance of the Christian Sunday, as taught in the Protestant Church.

It was not intended to be enacted as a civil institution, for the mere purpose of providing the laboring classes with a period of rest, recreation and amusement; the very letter of the law testifies against such hypothesis. On the contrary, any recreation and amusement: which was not sanctioned by the Church law, the State law would not permit on the Sunday.

For example, the principal prohibitions of the State of Massachusetts are at present:

"Being present at any dancing, public diversion, show or entertainment, or being present at or taking part in any sport, game or play; fine not exceeding fifty dollars.

"Keepers of places of public entertainment or refreshment not to entertain persons or suffer them to remain in the place drinking, or spending their time idly or at play, or in doing any secular business; fine at first conviction not exceeding fifty dollars; at second conviction, not exceeding one hundred dollars.

"Travelling, except from necessity or charity; going visiting beyond the town limits and using horse cars within town limits is illegal travelling under this statute."

And the Sunday law of the State of Tennessee, although not quite as blue as that of her New England sister, has enough of a bluish tint to demonstrate that it is begotten by the spirit of sectarian influence, and not by the science of political economy—"Any person who shall hunt, fish or play at any game of sport, shall be subject to a fine, etc." (Section 1824, Code of Tennessee.)

These few quotations, to which we could add many more, furnish irrefutable testimony that the State is more anxious to maintain and enforce the religious observance of the first day of the week, in accordance with theological interpretation, than to defend a principle of political economy, and to give the laboring classes an opportunity to recuperate their minds and bodies by the exhilarating influence of social pleasure and amusement. The Puritan spirit has left such indelible sectarian traces in the construction and application of Sunday laws that every unbiased mind can decide at once that all efforts to construe it as a purely civil law must prove a failure. So oppressive are these regulations in certain States to the working classes, that a majority of them prefer the labors of Monday to the gloom of Sunday.

THE STRICTLY PHYSICAL ASPECTS.

Had the State Legislature considered only the physical aspects of a day of rest it would have enacted only such laws as are prohibitions of hard labor and fatiguing work. And instead of proscribing places of amusement and entertainment, it would have encouraged their use in a legitimate manner. It would have permitted all acts and deeds on Sunday which do not carry with them an undue waste of the physical forces and nervous energies of man, and which do not inflict direct injuries upon the life and property of other men.

Aye, the State could have done even more than that, provided the question of a day of rest had been considered upon the general grounds of necessity, and been based upon the science of political economy. Instead of consulting the traditions of the synagogue and church, the scientific men of our age should have been asked how much physical rest is necessary for man under the present conditions of society, with the amount of labor that is allotted to him now in the presence of the helpful mechanical inventions of the age.

Perhaps the conclusion would be reached that labor having increased and causing a larger waste of nerve and muscle, one day in five should be given as a day of rest to the laborer and mechanic; or, perhaps, the researches of competent political economists would prove, upon statistical evidence, that since the introduction of steam and electrical power human force is not taxed half as much in agricultural work and mechanical labor, and that one day in *twelve* is the just proportion of physical rest to labor.

There is still another result to these observations: It may be discovered that if the eight-hour system is granted as a boon to the laboring classes, no day of physical rest is needed at all, because sixteen hours out of twenty-four are granted for that purpose, which would secure such rest and leisure to the working classes that no civil law of the land need be called in requisition to *compel* the observance of a special day of rest and repose for the body.

## THE TRUE SABBATH IS SPIRITUAL.

God himself has written the law of daily rest in the very heart of creation. Whenever the sun sets at the close of the day the natural period of physical rest commences, then the sabbath of physical rest has come, bringing with it the angel of sleep, the greatest benefactor of the sons of toil. The body needs no special day of rest; each night is its sabbath.

It is the soul, the spirit, which needs a Sabbath, to gain spiritual consolation and religious instruction, and, to provide for this necessity is the office of religion, the mission of each church within its own borders. With this spiritual work the State has nothing to do, and this spiritual Sabbath must unfold its beauty and sanctity by the innate force of religion. The rose and the lily will unfurl their delicate bloom and pour out their sweet perfume only when they are allowed to grow and expand by the innate force which God has laid in root, stem and flower. They would wither in our hands should we make the rude attempt to force asunder their delicate fabric. Even so will the beauty and glory of a spiritual Sabbath fade away, when the hand of the law uses forcible measures to impose it upon man.
