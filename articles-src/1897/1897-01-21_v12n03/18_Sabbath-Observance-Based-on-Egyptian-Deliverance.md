The Christian Endeavorer announces the "great discovery" that the reason why the Sabbath was kept by God's people prior to the day of Pentecost, was that God delivered the children of Israel out of Egyptian bondage. Possibly this may find credence with people who have never read the fourth commandment; but anyone who knows how that commandment reads knows that it bases Sabbath observance upon the example of God during Creation week. Would it not be better to learn the prominent and important truths relating to Sabbath observance as set forth by Inspiration, than to overlook them in the interests of a "great discovery"?
