As one reads the newspapers and magazines these days, there are two general impressions which make themselves felt upon his mind. One is, that the condition of affairs in this world, as regards government and the relations of the people with each other, is very unsatisfactory. It has been very bad for a long time, and seems to be getting worse rather than better.

* * *

People find a great deal of fault with the government. It fails to promote those ends of human welfare which it is supposed that governments are intended to serve, and people are beginning to distrust it and to look to other means for reaching what they conceive to be the demands of justice. It is quite fashionable now to lynch some kinds of real or supposed criminals instead of seeking to have them dealt with by the law. This is only one symptom of the general state of things. There are many others which find expression in different ways, but all indicative of the same general feeling that the affairs of government have been mostly turned out of the course of justice, and into the channel of subserviency to narrow and selfish ends.

* * *

At the bottom of this is a general feeling of natural distrust on the part of the people. As was said recently by a speaker who has carefully noted the situation, "The Republican party has no confidence in the Democratic, nor the Democratic in the Republican; the East distrusts the West and the West the East; the employer has no faith in the conscience of the employé, nor does the employé trust the employer. We find these various lines of cleavage running all through society—everywhere this lack of confidence." This being so, it is not strange that newspaper and magazine literature should be largely devoted to showing how things are not as they ought to be, and how one class of individuals are knaves and another class fools for allowing them to be as they are.

* * *

At the same time—and this is the other impression that one gets—there are an abundance of infallible remedies for all these evils. Almost every writer has one for the evils of which he speaks, and its virtue is so plain that, in his opinion, only bigotry or prejudice can prevent any individual from seeing it. So almost everybody is hopeful that, while things are in a very bad state just now, they will be all right very shortly, as soon as the people can get to work and supply the remedy. It is human nature to be hopeful, and it is well that is so; yet it is not well to build hopes upon a false foundation. Almost everybody hopes and intends to do better and be better in the near future than he has done and been in the past, basing this hope and intention on the feeling that he could do better if he only would; and so of the people in general; they likewise—so it is felt—could do better if they only would; and the would-be reformer has hopeful visions of a day just at hand when the people will rise up and do these better things, and relegate the evils which prevail in society and government into an eternal oblivion. And in some such way as this—so some of them think—will be ushered in the millennium.

* * *

But the truth is that the situation demands a remedy which is really beyond the power of the people themselves to supply. Just as with the individual who is always "going" to do better, so with the nation, which is made up of individuals, there is necessary a higher power and wisdom than resides in humanity to produce the better reality which is in prospect. And the trouble is that instead of looking to this higher source, men are looking only to themselves, trying to get out of themselves something which will lift them above themselves, up to the plane of moral perfection. But the plane of self, and of all that is in self, is right where they are now; and to try to get any power out of self to elevate themselves above this, is but to try to lift one's self by one's self. Everybody learns in childhood that this cannot be done, as regards the body. But very many seem never able to learn the parallel truth as regards the soul.

* * *

Whoever would lift himself higher than he is, must take hold of something above him, and not hold of the straps of his boots. And as it must be with one individual, so must it be with the whole people.

The great "Christian" Powers of Europe who have for years been in the partitioning business with respect to such territory as they did not already possess, and independently of the consent of the inhabitants, have now come in sight of a very fat prize of this nature, and their hands are fairly itching to get hold of it. And this prize is nothing else than the great empire of China. All signs point to the conclusion that this venerable empire, which can claim a greater antiquity than any other empire on the globe, will in the natural course of events soon become a thing of history only; that it is about to fall a victim to the insatiable lust for wealth which is the characteristic spirit of the age.

* * *

The justification for this proceeding on the part of the Powers—as they view it—has been involuntarily furnished by China herself. This is to say, she has demonstrated her weakness. This she did in the late war with Japan. In this war, some of her territory, part of her fleet, and some thousands of her soldiers, fell before the arms of the Japanese; but all this was as nothing in comparison with the real loss resulting from hostilities with Japan, which was that of her protection against the encroachments of the Powers of Europe. It had been supposed that China, with her immense population, needed only to be once thoroughly roused into action under the leadership of men of military skill, to become one of the most formidable military powers in the world. It is now demonstrated that this supposition was entirely incorrect: that China's swarming myriads are not a source of real strength to the empire; that the latter is wanting in cohesion; and that, in fact, there is little or nothing more to hinder the carving up of the empire by enterprising outside parties than there was to restrain the like enterprise in the territory of Africa.

THAT the thing is easy to be done, is, as we have stated, full justification for the act of doing it, in the view of the "Christian" Powers. We know this is so because their actions have conclusively shown it. In the ethics of European statesmanship, might and right are synonymous terms. When the partitioning of Africa was in full progress, a few years ago, the mere exploration of any territory, no matter how thickly populated with human beings possessing all the natural rights of mankind, was deemed to confer a perfectly valid title of ownership upon the explorers, and the government of which they were subjects; so that, as one facetious writer expressed it, the would-be "discoverer" of any new region had first to promise that he would give it back, before the Powers would allow him to do so. Africa is already partitioned among these Powers, and now it is China's turn, unless all signs are misleading. The only thing that hinders is the well-understood fact that each of the "Christian" Powers who have become the self-appointed administrators of the Celestial estate, wants the biggest and best slice of the same for itself.

"An ordinance in Cleveland," says the Jewish Messenger, "permits a Hebrew who observes the Sabbath to keep his billiard saloon open on Sunday, but fines non-Hebrews who may play billiards therein."

The law allows the Hebrew this liberty because he religiously observes the seventh day of the week. It exempts him upon religious grounds; and any one, by becoming religious in this way, can secure the exemption. Therefore it is on religious grounds that its exemption is secured and its penalty inflicted; for the exemption is denied to people because they are not observers of the seventh day. And yet it is claimed that the law is not religious, but purely secular!
