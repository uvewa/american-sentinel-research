The opponents of Sunday laws are often classed with the friends of the saloon. A plausible excuse for this unfairness is found in the declaration that the abolition of Sundays laws would necessarily pave the way for the wide open Sunday saloon. While this is measurably true, it would inevitably have one good result. The iniquity of the liquor traffic could no longer be disguised under the flimsy veil of an outward respect for Sunday. The criminality of saloon-keeping lies not in the day when the traffic is carried on, but in the traffic itself; and the sooner the public conscience is educated on that point, the better it will be for the welfare of the people.

The absurdity of the legislation which is supposed to "regulate" the liquor traffic, is seen in the fact that it throws around it the sanction of the law six days in the week, and makes it a crime on the other day. While the closing of the saloon on the day when its patrons are more than usually idle may have some advantages, they are more than offset by the fact that it is a compromise with the crime itself, and a sedative to the public conscience, which ought to be kept constantly awake to the evils of the saloon business every day and all the time.

To those who charge us with friendliness to the saloon in opposing Sunday laws we have this reply: You are specially hostile to the saloon one seventh of the time, while we oppose it all the time.
