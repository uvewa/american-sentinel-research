Persecutions for religion's sake are usually conducted by a small number of persons, while the masses of the people sympathize with the victims. The seeming exceptions are when, superadded to religious differences, there are hatreds, either racial or caused by war; or tyrannical feelings generated under despotic governments.

In England, for the two centuries before the death of Elizabeth, there were only 400 heretics burned at the stake; and 300 of these perished in the last three years of the reign of "bloody Mary" Tudor. During the same period the number of those burned in the Netherlands was about 75,000, and in Spain nearly as many. The greater slaughter under Spanish rule was due principally to the passions fomented by the long wars in Spain against the Moors, Moriscoes, and Jews, and fostered by the despotic character of the royal government.

In Scotland, about 1684, James II began to persecute Protestants. He used "thumbkins" and "boots" for the torture of his victims. These instruments crushed the bones and marrow. James took delight in personally witnessing their operation and hearing the screams and entreaties of the sufferers. He was supported and lauded by a few clergymen, but he was abhorred by the people. They called him "monster." When he fled the country, he left few friends in the Scottish lowlands.

In New England, in the 17th century, the persecutions of the Baptists and Quakers, the scourggings, solitary confinements, ear clippings, tongue borings, and hangings, were favored by zealous preachers and by leading church members high in office; but public opinion was outraged and the rescues of victims became so numerous and popular opposition so pronounced that the persecutions were gradually abandoned.

What is true of religious persecutions in other times and lands is true of those now waged in the States of this Union under "Sunday laws." The people generally do not favor them. These laws, obtained mostly by the lobbying importunities of paid agents of clergy-led societies, cannot be enforced as other laws are. Nobody is injured by the violation of them and nobody will appear as prosecuting witness. If enforced at all, it must be by paid spies and informers, wretches who, in the large cities, earn a scant livelihood by making trouble for honest men, their neighbors. No decent citizen will engage in such work. If a church member should do it once through zeal in excess, the contempt of the community prevents him from repeating it. In rural districts, such laws are not often enforced; though they exist in all the States, it is believed that they have never been enforced in one third of the counties in any State. In some of the largest States they have not been enforced in more than from three to six counties. In some cases the sentences have not been executed; and in others the fines have been paid by sympathetic bystanders. In others again the oppression and distress have been fearful.

In the District of Columbia it is probable that nine tenths of the adult population are opposed to the pending Sunday bill. It will be advocated, however, by two or three clergymen and a paid agent of the Reform society. These gentlemen are anxious to get power to add to the chain-gang all persons who do not observe Sunday after the Puritan fashion.
