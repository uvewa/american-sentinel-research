"Good morning, children. I am glad to see so many happy faces before me. This is your meeting, and I will therefore expect you to do a good deal of the talking. Now, in the first place, I ask you what it is to be a Christian?"

"It is to be like Jesus."

"It is to keep the commandments."

"It is to be good."

"It is to be like Christ."

"Very well. Now what do you think would be a good text of the Bible to start with?"

"We shall be like him." 1 John 3:2.

"As he is, so are we in this world." 1 John 4:17.

"He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked." 1 John 2:6.

"Very good. You must have studied your Bibles a good deal to have such ready answers."

"We attend Sabbath-school, sir."

"That's right. Now tell me, if a boy is greedy, and selfish, what do you say of him?"

"He is piggish."

"He is hoggish."

"Can a pig or hog be a Christian?"

"No, sir."

"If any person acts like a pig or hog, is he a Christian?"

"No, sir."

"I should say not."

"Suppose I write on a slip of paper, 'This is a Christian,' and tie it on the pig, would that make a Christian of him?"

"No, sir."

"Suppose I paste the paper on a piggish boy, would it make a Christian of him?"

"No, sir. He would be just as piggish as he was before."

"Very well. Now, if most of the people who live in this city or country, were greedy, and selfish, and filthy in their habits, what animal would you draw on your slates to show what kind of people they were?"

"A pig."

"A hog."

"That's right. Now, God represents nations by beasts. Do you know of any such spoken of in the Bible?"

"Yes, sir. In the book of Daniel Babylon is called 'like a lion,' and Medo-Persia 'like a bear.'"

"What is the difference between a lion and a bear?"

"One thing is, a lion holds his head up, and looks bold; but a bear holds his head down, and looks sneaky and savage."

"That will do. Now, can either a lion, or a bear, be a Christian?"

"No, sir. No more'n the pig could."

"If the nation represented by the lion, or the bear, had declared by law or decree, that it was a Christian nation, would it have made itself a Christian nation?"

"No, sir; it would have told a lie."

"Now can you think of another nation that is represented in the Bible by a beast?"

"Yes, sir. The two-horned beast is like the United States."

"Well, here is a picture of a two-horned beast. How do you like his looks?"

"He looks cross."

"He looks some like a tiger."

"He has got a mane like a lion."

"He's got two little horns; I should n't think he could hook very well with them."

"Can such a beast be a Christian?"

"No, sir!"

"Can the people who make up this nation, and are as bad tempered as such a beast, be a Christian nation?"

"No, sir; but there are some good Christians among them."

"Yes; but they belong to the kingdom of heaven. There are, also, a good many others not claiming to be Christians, who are excellent people, and who would like to better the management of the government, but cannot. God represents the nation by the spirit that actually rules it. Now, if I should write on a slip of paper, as I did for the pig, 'This is a Christian,' would that make him a Christian any more than it did the pig?"

"No, sir."

"Well, on the 29th of February, 1892, the Supreme Court of the United States declared this to be 'a Christian nation.' Did that decision make it a Christian nation?"

"No, sir. It was like the two-horned beast just the same as before."

"True. In the Bible God does not change the symbol or beast representing this nation to the end of time; only he is once or twice called the 'false prophet,' because he said he was a Christian when he wasn't one at all."

A. SMITH.
