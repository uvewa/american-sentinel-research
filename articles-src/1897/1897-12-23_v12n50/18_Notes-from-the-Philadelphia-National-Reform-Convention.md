[This convention met in Philadelphia, December 7-9, to discuss the so-called "Christian principles of civil government."

Among those prominent at the convention were Rev. Dr. John McNaugher, Rev. W. T. Chase, Rev. Dr. Josiah Strong, of New York City, and Dr. David McAllister, editor of the *Christian Statesman*. There was much said that was full of interest and significance. This will be evident from a perusal of the following notes of the convention, taken for the SENTINEL by Mr. W. L. Winner:—]

Dr. McNaugher, who presided, in his opening address, began with defining the object of the National Reform Association as "standing for a governmental recognition of God as the source of all government, and Jesus Christ, God's Son, as the nation's Lord and King; the Bible as the ultimate rule of civil life and the supreme test of loyal citizenship."

He said, "As a nation we present the anomaly of standing before the world a Christian people, but with an unchristian Constitution. We seek to remove the anomalous position that has been fastened upon us, and proudly present to the world a constitution and government that is consistent in character with our people.

### CLEVELAND'S THANKSGIVING PROCLAMATION CITED.

"Our national life as a Christian people found its inception in the sturdy manhood and religious simplicity of the New England Puritans. It is made more impressive and sure by virtue of our organic usages and customs, which culminated a few years ago in *that grand monument* of *national Christianity*, the last Thanksgiving proclamation of President Cleveland."

He made reference to the charge of their opponents that this movement is but "a parchment reform," and declared that it was "infinitely more;" that it contemplated a "radical, tangible reform that has already entered, and will be fought out, upon the arena of free thought."

As to the charge that National Reform means union of church and state, he cited that the movement "is not championed by any one distinct denomination or religious class. There is, in our land, no dominant sect, and there can be no more systematic concert. This is a sufficient answer; union of church and state in this country is impossible."

He showed the need of reform—citing the social, industrial, and political conditions, and declaring that the existence of all these things gave "a sufficient reason for the most earnest efforts toward the enthronement of Christianity in civil life." "To this end we seek alliance with all organizations seeking the same end." "This is radical reform." "What must be done is an awakening of public sentiment far and wide."

### HOW THEY WILL USE THE CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR AND KINDRED SOCIETIES.

He referred to the Christian Endeavor and allied organizations as being "the hope and the instrument of this work." "Their numbers, enthusiasm, and influence, indicate a condition of manhood disciplined for its speedy advancement." The point that is rapidly assuming the first importance in their activity is "the assertion of Christianity in the political sphere."

This point was taken up by the Rev. Dr. Strong, who in his speech said:—

"We propose to use these societies to distribute reform literature to every one that can be reached and influenced. The leaders of these societies are in full sympathy with this plan, and I feel sure that the rank and file are just waiting to be set at this great work.

"The young people had been drilled and now appreciate the fact that they must go into the field and fight. General McClellan was fond of drilling his troops, but didn't want to fight them; he was too careful of them. He was very fond of them, and was spoken of as being like a father to his troops. This fatherly interest, together with the seeming disinclination to fight, caused some one to remark that McClellan was so good a father to his men that they were not likely to ever get a *step father*. But Father Endeavor Clark is not that way. He has his men well drilled and is ready and willing to fight them."

### WHAT IT MEANS.

He stated that "if one in ten Endeavorers would distribute twelve leaflets once a month, it would mean six million in a year."

He referred to the coming of the kingdom of God by means of this reform effort, in a manner that was dramatic in the extreme, ending with the declaration, "I believe the new Jerusalem is now coming down from God out of heaven."

**RADICAL REMARKS BY DR. MCALLISTER.**

Dr. McAllister, in his address, made some radical remarks.

He said: "Romanism is expecting that this country will, in the great crisis that seems to be impending, break away from the secular idea in government and turn to them as the restorer of peace and tranquillity."

**THE "INFALLIBLE" STATE.**

"There are three faces to the subject of civil government; one is the secular idea, the other is the church idea, which is the Romanist idea of church infallibility applied to government; the third is the movement to embody Christian principles of righteousness in the organic law so that the state shall be the infallible interpreter of and the active agent in applying moral law."

**THE GOSPEL IGNORED.**

In all the speeches, not a single reference was made to the reformation of the individual or to the application of the gospel as the source and power of true reform. However, there was one feature that was most gratifying. A part of the evening was set apart for an "open parliament on Christian citizenship," in which it was expected that the presidents of each of the several young people's societies would indorse the proposed plan, etc., and thus officially commit their organizations to the ideas and principles advocated.

**THE SCHEME REDUKED.**

This was a most dampening failure, as but one of the four responded and his remarks could be construed only as a dignified rebuke to the purpose and spirit of the occasion.

Mr. Stoever, also president of the Luther League and an officer of the national organization, presented the purpose and scope of work espoused by the league in such a manner that it was an emphatic condemnation of the proposal to abandon the power of the Word for the power of the ballot.
