"WELL, Charlie, my boy, how did you like your lesson in French history, yesterday? Did you learn anything, or get any facts you could bring home with you?"

"Learn anything! I guess I did; I just knew these lectures would pay a fellow to listen to, and I can tell you they do."

"Did you make any notes? I hope you did; for they may be of great value to you sometime."

"O yes; I made a few, but I got so interested that I didn't get as many as I wish I had. The thing that impressed me most was the awful cruelty of the ancient Romans to their captives. Professor said it was the same in all ages of the world; the stronger are apt to oppress the weaker."

"True; but that is not Christ's way," said Mrs. White.

The next Wednesday afternoon found a goodly representation of sunny-faced girls and boys gathered in the classroom promptly at the hour.

"Can you tell me where the previous lesson ended? Hands up. Edna Phillips may answer."

"At the conquering of Gaul by Julius Caesar," said Edna, whose memory was her strong point.

"Right. This was hundreds of years from the time described in the beginning of the lesson. And so we find that the more modern inhabitants of Gaul do not at all resemble the more ancient ones. They had learned to dress themselves in bright and gay colors, and to wear very much jewelry. But there is as much difference between the Frenchman of to day and the Gaul as he looked in the time of Julius Caesar, as there was between the ancient and the more modern Gaul. These latter were tall and had broad shoulders, blue eyes, and fair, long, flowing beards, which sometimes were considerably in the way of the vain owners, especially in times of battle. The Gauls had a pretty correct idea of the best way of keeping in fighting order; for when any soldier became very fat, some form of punishment was given him.

"The wives of these people were very warlike, like their husbands, and it is said of them that they 'gnashed their teeth and brandished their arms like a windmill, when opposed to the enemy.' I see some of the girls smile at this description of the ladies of Gaul, as it is so far different from the Christian idea of what constitutes a true woman. But these Gauls, after being conquered by the Romans, adopted the more civilized mode of life of their conquerers. But this did not prevent them from sometimes burying or burning their horses, dogs, or even slaves, with their dead owners.

"But they had one redeeming feature at least; for they were really far in advance of most barbarians in the respect which they gave to their wives, and history tells us that these women repaid them in love and devotion.

"Rome was mistress now for the next 500 years, and as she was ever given to luxury and riotous living, so the inhabitants of her conquered territory soon learned to follow her example. The wealthier Gauls became more extravagant in their mode of living than even the Romans. They did not know the meaning of the word 'prudent.' The costly palaces and magnificent dwellings all bore witness to this fact. But where, alas! did the money for all these extravagances come from? I think you can all guess."

"I presume it came from the working classes," said Jack Smith, raising his hand.

"Yes; and they protested and cried and groaned, but it did no good. No one could get from under the cruel power of Rome."

"Couldn't they run away to some other country?" asked Charlie White, excitedly.

"Indeed they could not, or if they did, Rome, the proud mistress of land and sea, would run after them and bring them back to their cruel labor. An old Latin writer," continued Professor Carman, "in speaking of Roman taxation, says:—

"The lands were measured out, to the last clod; trees and vines were counted; every head of cattle was entered on the tax list; every human being was registered; nothing was heard but whips and cries of torment. . . . No excuse was admitted on the score of age or sickness; meanwhile the animals were diminished, the men were dying off, and still the tax was exacted for the dead.'

"Gaul plays a very important part in Roman history during the first century after Christ. Augustus and Claudius lived in Lyons, or Lugdunum, and Caligula, one of the most cruel of Rome's tyrants, made Gaul the theater of many of his fiendish and 'mad freaks.' Claudius was the mildest emperor of his age, but was very harsh and severe with the Druids, whom he drove out of the country. Until this time, the religion of Gaul, or Druidism (some of the rites of which required human sacrifices), and the religion of Rome—paganism—lived and grew side by side. But after the Druid priests had been driven away by the emperor, this religion gradually gave place to the gods of Rome, till Christianity found a foothold.

"During the reign of Vespasian, there was a man named Civilis, who determined that Gaul should be free; so he raised an army and proclaimed a man named Sabinus, emperor. But the rebellion was quelled, and though Sabinus and his faithful wife concealed themselves for nine years in a cave, they were found and beheaded by the cruel emperor. Although he was pronounced the most merciful of any who had preceded him, he did not heed the first principle of love laid down by Him who had said: 'Love your enemies, do good to them which persecute you, and pray for them which despitefully use you?'

"How long was it before the religion of Christ was taught in Gaul? I would like to make a note of it," asked Rob Billings, who seemed to be making good use of his pencil and note-book.

"It was about 160 years after Christ. Some Christians from Asia Minor, heeding their Master's command to go into all the world, settled in the place which is now called Lyons. But a bitter persecution was soon started,—you see that the spirit of religious persecution is as old as Satan himself. The more the emperor wanted to please his gods, the more he felt it to be his duty to punish those who differed from him in their religious convictions. So they were tortured in every way that cruel men could invent; and all this under the foolish notion that they were pleasing the gods."

"How long did this persecution last?" asked Edna Phillips, with a little quaver in her voice, for she was a tender-hearted girl and could never endure to see any of God's creatures suffer.

"For about 150 years, off and on," answered Professor Carman, "and then, about the beginning of the fourth century, Constantine declared himself a Christian.

"When you and Robert go to Paris, Charlie," said the professor, who knew of their promised visit, you will see a hill just outside the city, called 'Montmartre,' or 'Mountain of Martyrs.'"

"We will look for it," said Charlie, writing busily in his note-book.

"We will soon begin to introduce dates, which will help us better to keep in mind the events. But we have taken such rapid strides in these first lessons that we have not found it practicable. But you can remember that we have taken you now, from the first settlement of Marseilles about 600 years before Christ, to the professed conversion of Constantine, about the beginning of the fourth century.

"Now I will ask, How many wish to continue these studies?"

"All of us!" shouted a dozen voices at once.

"Well, then, I shall expect you all to be present next Wednesday afternoon, when we will hear something about the Franks."

Then the children hurried home to display their notebooks to their parents, and to declare that they thought Professor Carman's talks were going to be a great help to them.
