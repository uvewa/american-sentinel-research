The German emperor is quoted as having said recently that "only worthy Christians can fulfil the duty of Prussian soldiers." What a painful surprise the emperor would receive if his magnificent army should all at once become worthy Christians in truth, and instead of training themselves longer to slaughter their fellow men, train themselves in the "meekness and gentleness of Christ"! It is not probable that the emperor wants his soldiers to lay aside their carnal weapons for spiritual ones.

The remark, however, illustrates the governmental idea as regards who are worthy Christians; that is, they are those who can be depended on to fight the hardest to enforce the government's will.
