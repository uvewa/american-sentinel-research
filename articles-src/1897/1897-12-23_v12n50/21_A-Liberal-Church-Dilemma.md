The Christian Register (Unitarian) makes the following comment upon the awkward position in which many church members of this day find themselves, through the endeavors of the churches to be "liberal," and still retain their creeds:

"The difficulty with the position of liberal members of creed-bound churches is revealed in the statement that they may be received into fellowship, 'provided they have no pronounced or active dissent from certain doctrines regarded as important, although they doubt or even disbelieve them.' This amounts to saying that they may have doubts or denials, but that they must not express them. But, if the doctrines are really important, as the church asserts, the denial of them must be important, too. If, for example, one dissents from the doctrine of an endless hell, because, to his mind, it discredits faith in the eternal goodness of God, his dissent ought to take some pronounced and active form. The position of those who formally acquiesce in a creed which antagonizes their personal convictions reminds us of a little girl who showed a friend a work of art recently acquired and much admired by the family. After standing before it for a moment, in an attitude of rapt admiration, she said, 'This is very beautiful; but I don't think so!'"

The only way out of the dilemma is to do away with the creed. All that ought to be required of any body as a condition of church membership is that he believes the truth. And the truth is the Word of God.
