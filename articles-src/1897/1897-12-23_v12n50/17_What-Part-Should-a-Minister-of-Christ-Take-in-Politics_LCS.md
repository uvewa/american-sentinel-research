The above was the subject before the city ministers' meeting at Lexington, Ky., a short time ago. The writer was present and noted a few of the many statements, which are very significant as straws that tell the way the wind is blowing. One speaker said, The White House needs in it a man who can and will supply all the needs of the people of this country; who will be interested in all their affairs, both temporal and spiritual; and, said he, who could do this better than a minister of the gospel? Another said that he that rules the church ought to govern the country; that the minister should go into politics to purify them, and give them dignity; that the trouble with the country to-day is that the ministers have had too little to do with politics, and that they should "come to the rescue at once."

Another said, If the ministers would take hold of the politics of this country more firmly, putting a stop to lawlessness, close all saloons and such places, stop the Sunday desecration, this would make the people attend church. "It is our duty," he said "to make people stop doing wrong, and teach them what is right in politics as well as in religion." "The minister that does not lead his people to the polls, and see that they vote right is not fit to lead them to the kingdom of God."

There were ten ministers present, representing several branches of Methodism, Disciple, and Baptist churches; only one Methodist protested against the general sentiment. Finally, the writer was asked to speak on the subject. He said in part: We are in a critical period of our country's history. Its friends will prove its foes; for they are getting control of the ship of state, and are heading her for the sand-bar of church and state. At the present rate we will strike before long. Brethren, you have ignored the fact that each of the many denominations would want to run the government on its own church plan, and there would be a worse muddle than we now have.

The writer spoke of the past history of church and state, its evils and cruelties, and of the present attitude of the papal power toward this government, and then called attention to the fact that the minister of Christ had a high calling, second to none, not even to that of president of these United States, for the minister is called and commissioned of God. His citizenship is in heaven, and his business is to preach the Word, nothing more, nothing less. He is called and separated unto the gospel of God. He must come out, be separate, touch not the unclean thing. You have all acknowledged that politics are very unclean; so, brethren, take your hands off.

Shall the ambassador of Christ leave his God-given work, step down from the highway of holiness, to dabble in the mud-hole of politics? Surely not, for he can find enough of the world, the flesh, and the devil in the ordinary walks of life, without going into politics.

Then, brethren, this *making* people Christian by the arm of the civil law is foreign to the gospel. God leaves every man free to choose. The essence of the gospel is freedom, which voluntarily submits to absolute truth,—freedom of affection, and freedom of the will. To each of us each day, the Lord says, "Choose ye this day, whom ye will serve." His service is perfect freedom, for "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty,"—that is, liberty for you and every other man.
