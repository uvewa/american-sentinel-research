Cox, in the December issue of *The Defender*, makes the truthful observation that the training of children to proper Sabbath observance cannot be accomplished "by the methods employed by the stern old man who tied his boy to the bedpost on the Sabbath; to be shouldn't play marbles, and made him learn the hymn, Thine earthly Sabbaths, Lord, we love."
