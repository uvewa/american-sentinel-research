The well-meant scheme of securing perpetual peace between two great "Christian" nations by means of a treaty of arbitration, seems not to be proving a success. The proposed treaty in its original form provided that,—

"The high contracting parties agree to submit to arbitration, in accordance with the provisions and subject to the limitations of this treaty, all questions in difference between them which they may fail to adjust by diplomatic negotiations."

In the hands of the United States Senate, on March 31, this was amended to read as follows:—

"Any difference which, in the judgment of either party, materially affects its honor or its domestic or foreign policy, shall not be referred to arbitration under this treaty except by special agreement, nor shall any question as to the continuance in force of any treaty which has previously been made. It is further explicitly specified and agreed that all agreements entered into by the contracting parties under this treaty shall be signed by the President of the United States and receive the approval of the Senate by a two-thirds vote before it becomes binding upon Great Britain or the United States."

This seems to leave room for one more amendment to complete the farce to which the treaty is reduced; and accordingly the Independent (N. Y.) suggests the following:—

"Provided that, in the remote contingency that any case under this treaty is decided against the United States by an arbitral tribunal, such decision shall be null and void."

The moral of all which is that perpetual peace, whether between individuals or nations, cannot be secured without a genuine desire for peace on the part of the parties concerned. And this means the possession and manifestation of the spirit of self-sacrifice,—a thing which in national diplomacy is conspicuous only by its absence.

The Scripture says, "Let the peace of God rule in your hearts." People who will do this will live peaceably; and this is the one and only sure guarantee of the maintenance of peaceful relations.
