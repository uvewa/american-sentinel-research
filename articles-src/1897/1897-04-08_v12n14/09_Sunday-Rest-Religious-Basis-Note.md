The Christian Statesman says that people "will learn sooner or later that no civil right can be secured to any citizen on any other than a religious basis." This it says with reference to a demand for the "civil right" of Sunday rest, and it is, of course, an admission that such demands properly rest on a religious basis. That which rests on a religious basis is certainly religious itself; and such is the case with all legislation which the demand for Sunday rest has evolved.
