The clergy of the city of Cleveland, Ohio, are opposed to Sunday ball playing. They have learned that it is the intention of the management of the Cleveland league club to have Sunday games in that city during the coming baseball season, and they have promptly formulated their protests against it.

The question was the topic of discourse at the Dunham Avenue Disciple church (Rev. Mr. Chalmers, pastor), Sunday evening, March 28. "It was the intention of the speaker," says the Cleveland Leader in its report, "to make his remarks on Sunday baseball only a preface to a sermon on 'The Joy of Heaven;' but the latter subject was not touched upon, and the question of baseball became the sole topic of the evening."

This certainly reveals an unusual interest in the question on the part of this representative of Cleveland's clergy. It would seem that he considered a discussion of this subject to be equivalent in value to his congregation to a presentation of the gospel of God. Or can it be that he believed he was presenting the gospel in his remarks upon the impropriety of Sunday games?

The latter inference can hardly be allowed, since the speaker declared that he was presenting the subject from the standpoint of its legality, and not from that of its morality.

Alluding to an interview had with the manager of the Cleveland ball club, the Rev. Mr. Chalmers said:—

"I gave him to understand that I would fight to the end Sunday baseball, not as a preacher, but as a citizen; not with the Bible in my hand, but with the American flag."

Here is a mystery. Why should this minister of the gospel, in opposing that which he believes to be wrong, lay aside his Bible and take up the American flag? The American flag is the symbol of the American Government, and constitutes no standard of right and wrong. The Government may be right, or it may be wrong, but the flag remains its symbol at all times. Why then should the flag be better in the hands of a Christian minister than the Bible for convincing an opponent that he is in the wrong?

What is there in the American flag that discountenances Sunday ball playing? Many preachers seem to believe that the Bible is against Sunday ball, and an objection based upon religious grounds might be made with some show of plausibility; but what possible ground of objection to Sunday ball can be embodied in the flag is a question to which neither history nor reason can furnish an answer.

The Rev. Mr. Chalmers says that he would fight Sunday ball not as a preacher, but as a citizen. He is a citizen of the State of Ohio, and there is a law of the State which forbids baseball on Sunday. But what emphasis to this would be given by the American flag? The flag is not the flag of the State, but of the nation; and there is nothing in the national law which opposes Sunday ball. The national Constitution confers no power upon the national Legislature to forbid the playing of Sunday ball. And as a citizen of the United States, bearing the American flag, the Rev. Mr. Chalmers or any other person would necessarily stand in an attitude not at all unfavorable to Sunday games.

The speaker strongly alleged that his attitude in this matter was taken out of regard for law. "I am not standing," he said, "on the moral ground alone. It isn't a question as to whether I think it is right or wrong. It is the question as to whether it is law or not." This is precisely the principle by which the Christian martyrs were condemned and put to death during the Dark Ages. "Heresy" was against the law of the land, and the heretic, after being condemned by the Inquisition, was always turned over to the hands of the civil authorities, and from them received his punishment. It is an evil principle indeed that the only question to be considered in the administration of civil affairs, is that of what is the law. Laws ought always to be just; but they are frequently unjust. And when unjust, Right does not abdicate her throne in their favor. Right and justice always stand as the paramount claimants to our reverence and support. A minister of the gospel ought to be the last person to put the question of "what is the law?" above the question of what is right.

The speaker said further that "you don't have to believe the Bible to stand against Sunday baseball;" and in this he hit upon the truth. Reverence for Sunday is not based upon the Bible, but upon tradition; and the more the Bible is believed, the less opposition will there be to Sunday recreation in any form. The Bible speaks in a number of places of the first day of the week, but nowhere mentions it as a day different in character from any other day except the seventh, which it declares to be the "Sabbath of the Lord."

At the close of his discourse the speaker called upon his congregation for a rising vote in favor of supporting the Sunday law, and all present are said to have responded, with the exception of "five or six young men in the rear of the auditorium." Of this it may be said that to force a vote upon an issue only one side of which has been presented, making the voters commit themselves to that side without considering the evidence that might be given to the contrary, is a method of procedure quite characteristic of the movement for the maintenance and extension of Sunday legislation.

THERE is something decidedly curious about the spectacle of a minister of the gospel stepping out from the sphere of his calling and posing as the champion of law. Why should this be done by the clergy more than by the representatives of any other calling? Are not those in other professions honorable, honest, and law-abiding? Are they not as anxious as the clergy to live under a government in which public peace and prosperity are properly safeguarded by law? These questions must be answered in the affirmative.

Why, again, should it be only in case of a Sunday law that the clergy assume this pose? Are there not very many laws of the highest importance to the welfare of society, which need to be maintained against the assaults of the lawless? It must be admitted that there are. The tendency of the times is toward an increase of lawlessness, in those forms which are most destructive of human rights. Homicide is alarmingly on the increase, claiming by the latest statistics more than 10,500 victims in this country in a single year. Does not the prevalence of this crime, the epidemic of arson, the increase of robbery and drunkenness and other forms of iniquity which threaten the safety of society, afford as good opportunity to the clergy to become the special champions of law as does the desecration of Sunday?

Of course, from the standpoint of regard for Sunday as a religious institution, this attitude of the clergy is easily understood. But they strenuously assure us that in upholding Sunday laws they do not speak from a religious standpoint, or as preachers, but merely as citizens upholding the laws of the land. It is mysterious, to say the least.

Or, consider that other ground upon which the clergy so often base their support of Sunday laws,—that of physical necessity to the race. Why should the clergy take precedence of all other professions in looking out for the physical welfare of humanity? How does it happen that they know better than any others what man's physical system demands for the maintenance of health? One would suppose that the physicians would know best about this, and that they would have discerned man's physical need of Sunday rest before it was discovered by the preachers. But by some strange oversight they allowed the latter to surpass them completely on this point of physiological knowledge. Indeed, it is only through the preachers that we learn that the medical profession are even now informed upon this point!

And here again we are left to wonder that the researches of the clergy in the realm of man's physical necessities, and their special concern for the same, should be confined to the single matter of Sunday rest. For all this, be it remembered, has nothing to do with the clergy's regard for Sunday as a religious day, but is set forth by them from a purely civil standpoint, such as is held by all citizens in common!

Is it so, indeed? We dislike to doubt the sincerity of those who make this claim; but it must be said that the appearances are sadly against it.
