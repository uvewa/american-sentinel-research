The essence of religious despotism lies in the claim that individual opinions and actions different from those of the despot, must be suppressed, or expressed privately, and under such limitations as the despot may impose. The principle is the same, whether the despot be one individual or the concentrated and dominant "public opinion" of the majority. Public opinion is often the most cruel of despotic powers.

All Sunday laws contain the essence of this despotism, even though the theological theories concerning the Sabbath question logically forbid the existence or execution of such laws; for example: it is loudly asserted that God's law asks only the "observance of one day in seven, as individuals may choose." Sunday law adds: "But individual choice must be compelled by the will of the majority to regard one specific day which custom and law unite to designate."

To escape the charge of inconsistency and intolerance, it is added: "The law does not compel men to be religious on Sunday." Certainly not, because it cannot. But it does compel the cessation of labor and business, which is an act of deference to religion, and the only expression of the religious idea which the law can reach. The despotism of public opinion goes as far as it can toward compelling a religious regard for Sunday. When the world was a little more ignorant and religious, majorities were more intolerant, the law compelled attendance at church as well.
