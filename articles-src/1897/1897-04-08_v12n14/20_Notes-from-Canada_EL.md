[By Our Toronto Correspondent.]

SEVERAL occurrences having a bearing on the subject of religious liberty have transpired quite recently in the Dominion of Canada. The first event to which we will call attention is the coming of the papal ablegate, Mgr. Raphael Mery Del Val, who comes to this country ostensibly for the purpose of securing a settlement of the Manitoba School question more favorable to the Catholic minority. The arrival of the distinguished visitor in the city of Montreal was made the occasion of quite a display. The following announcement was issued at the Archbishop's palace:—

"His Excellency Mgr. Raphael Mery Del Val, apostolic delegate for Canada, will arrive at Montreal, Dalhousie-square, Thursday evening, at 7.55, by the Canadian Pacific train coming from Quebec.

"On this occasion, the priests of the city and neighboring parishes are requested to have the church bells rung from 8 to 8:30 o'clock, P. M. All the clergy and the faithful of the diocese are specially invited to the official reception which will take place at the Metropolitan Church immediately after the arrival of his excellency.

"By order of the vicar capitular,

"ALFRED ARCHAMBAULT,

"Canon, Chancellor."

In a speech in the Dominion House of Commons on the settlement of the School Question and the mission to the Pope concerning it, Mr. W. F. McLean said, as reported in his paper, the Toronto World, of April 1:—

"I am glad to see that the Prime Minister accepts the responsibility of the settlement which has been made. The Liberals as a party accept the responsibility of the settlement, and, speaking of parliamentary responsibility, I come to another point. . . .

"I say that the Government and their party must take full responsibility for that mission to Rome. They cannot escape that responsibility. They have said that it is on behalf of their party that they went there, and, seeing that we are governed by the principle of Parliamentary responsibility, they must accept that responsibility before the people. They say that they went to Rome to vindicate the civil liberties of the people of Quebec. Mr. Speaker, while I sympathize with them in their efforts to conserve their political liberties, I do not agree with them in the authority to which they went to protect those liberties. It is not in St. Peter's, it is not in the Vatican, it is not in the Seven Hills of Rome that the political, the civil liberties of British citizens are conserved. If there is a temple sacred to British liberty, if there is a place where our rights are to be protected, that temple is within these walls of Parliament. The shrine of our liberties is on the floor of the House, and we, the members of the House, are the sacristans of that temple; we are the priests, the ministers at this shrine; we, worthy or unworthy as we may be, are the men who must protect the civil liberties of the people.

"What will happen to gentlemen on the other side of the House if it turns out that the ablegate now in this country does not come to their relief and does not pronounce in their favor and guarantee their civil liberties, which they now profess they seek to protect? They will have to come down here to defend and protect these liberties if they are assailed. . . .

"I must take objection to the statement of the Solicitor-General (Mr. Fitzpatrick) last night in the comparison he made between His Holiness and Her Gracious Majesty. We who are Canadians say that there is no one but Her Majesty to appeal to in the protection of the civil liberties of British subjects the world over. She is the guardian of our civil liberties, not His Holiness of Rome. . . When we read the history of the unification of Italy, when we recall the names of Garibaldi and Mazzini, and the other heroes of that struggle, he is not the man whose name should be quoted by the Liberal party in the vindication of the liberties of the people of this country."
