The Pope has a new scheme for regaining his lost temporal sovereignty, evolved from the outcome of the late Italian war with Abyssinia. The Italian government requested the Pope to negotiate with the Negus of Abyssinia on behalf of the Italian prisoners detained by him, and the Pope seemed favorable to the undertaking. And now, says the Independent, "a cardinal, whose name is not given, in conversation with a correspondent of a Catholic paper, intimates that an understanding might be reached between the Vatican and the Quirinal provided King Humbert's court and government were removed from the Eternal City and the Pope was given reasonable assurance of non-interference from the secular arm. He would be satisfied with less territory than the Holy See formerly occupied, but it is absolutely necessary that Rome should be free to him. In return for this concession the Pope would allow the faithful in Italy to take part in the elections."
