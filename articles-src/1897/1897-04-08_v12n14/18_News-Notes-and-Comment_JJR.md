A distinguished prelate recently lectured in a neighboring city on the Cretan difficulty. Needless to say, he handled his subject altogether from a sectarian standpoint. Among other things it is reported that he dwelt with eloquent and impressive emphasis on the story of "the famous banner carried by the Bishop of Pelos, which led the Greeks to victory in 1821, and which is now being carried by the noble army of Christians who are advancing on Thessaly against Turkey." It is added that "a picture of the banner, with its Greek inscription created an outburst of enthusiasm." This makes very interesting reading in the nineteenth century of "Christian" civilization. When we bear in mind that the purpose of the "advance" made by this "noble army" was to despoil a neighboring country of its territory, and that the "noble army" counts on accomplishing its aim not by square fighting or its own valor, but through extorting support from some stronger power than its own government as the result of international jealousies which its action will arouse—when we remember that such conduct, prompted by such motives, is undertaken in the name of Christianity, we may well wonder what the inscription may be which appears on that "famous banner," and "aroused enthusiasm" in a Christian assembly.

***

Is it, perchance: "Whatsoever ye will that men should do unto you, do ye also unto them"? Is it "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you"? Or, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself"? Or, "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance"? Or, "Be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another"? Or is it possible that the "famous banner" that once led the Greeks to victory and was borne by a "Christian" bishop and is now again in the field had upon it another inscription; and was the enthusiasm of the lecturer's audience aroused by reading the Greek equivalent of these English words: "Put up again thy sword into his place; for all they that take the sword shall perish by the sword"?

***

Well, well! Since the pagan Constantine "conformed," and the "Christian" clergy "went into politics," the same old story has been told over and over again, as this learned lecturer told it. In buildings called "churches," built and kept by the State, men called "clergymen," employed and paid by the State as adjuncts of its police, have, from time to time, as their superiors commanded, blessed banners that were to be carried at the head of regiments, in order to subserve the same purpose for which soldiers are sometimes given infusions of gunpowder and tobacco in whisky—namely, to excite them to a nervous frenzy, so as to make them at once indifferent to their own safety, and ravenous for the lifeblood of their antagonists. The first "famous banner" of this sort to be upraised in the name of Christianity was made and sent upon its wicked mission by this same pagan, Constantine, after he and the bishops of his time had consummated the first union of the State with the "Christian" Church. It was called "the labarum." It is upon record that Constantine's soldiers fought harder, killed and wounded more men, and attacked with more recklessness after they got that banner than they did before; and thus was the Prince of Peace obeyed and served by the National Church militant, even as he is to-day.

And, so, if war eventuate between Greece and Turkey, and the news shall be wired to Athens that the Turks have sustained a great defeat, and thousands of them have been killed, and thousands more of them cruelly maimed for life, the Greek churches will be thrown open, and the priests therein will sing "Te Deum"s in their joy. Te Deum, laudamus for battle and murder and sudden death! Te Deum, laudamus for desolated fields, destroyed cities, ruined homes, and robbery, rape and rapine! Te Deum, laudamus for slaughtered and mutilated men, for widowed and outraged women, for orphaned children, wandering far and wide!

***

The Greeks ought to have a "National Christian Hymn" to supplement the work of their National Christian Banner, in the spreading of Christianity and the gospel among those unbelieving Turks. The poem from which the following stanzas are taken would fill the bill admirably. It was written years ago and dedicated to "the war clergy" of another country far away from theirs:—

"O God of battles! Once again,
With banner, trump and drum,
And garments in Thy wine-press dyed,
To give thee thanks we come!

Teach us to hate, and so to fight,
To rob, to maim, to slay,
And when the last red drop is shed,
We'll kneel again—and pray!"

A vacancy has occurred in the Canadian Parliament, and in due course a "writ" was issued to authorize a new election, in order that it might be filled. A dispatch informs us that the government has been requested to withdraw the writ and inform the Parliament that this action has been taken because a free election is impossible in the city of Quebec, which is a part of the district or province at present without a representative. The reason given for this request and statement is that the Roman Catholic bishop of that diocese, Monsignor Lafleche, is likely to exceed his colleague, Bishop Blais, of Bonaventure, in the exercise of his spiritual influence over the voters. It is a little difficult to understand how this could be done, even with the utmost zeal on the part of the good bishop first named. In these days the Inquisition is not available; and it seems that the last extremity of terror now at the command of the Church is that which she awakens by the threat of excommunication. Inasmuch as Bishop Blais has explicitly announced that he will excommunicate every person who votes contrary to his instructions, it seems that he has about exhausted the resources of his communion as a factor in politics, and all that Bishop Lafleche can do is to prove an honorable second in the premises.

* * *

The political activity of the Canadian clergy is largely the fruit of indulgence, although, as already stated, it originates in the position of extraordinary strength and serenity guaranteed to the Roman Catholic Church by the treaty of cession from France to England. The latter country, as that acute observer, "Max O'Rell," has pointed out, uses the Catholic Church to save it expense in keeping order. The emoluments are preserved, and the price of them is paid regularly. If a robbery is committed, no secrets of the confessional are betrayed, but the self-accused sinner is urged, if not commanded, to give himself up and make restitution. If a young man is too dilatory in his courtship, the "father" orders him either to marry the girl or make way for another less timid or sluggish. And so on. Of course, the English government is doing a serious injustice to its Canadian subjects when it takes their money from them in the form of taxes and then uses a portion of what is thus collected to pay certain men for keeping them in the spiritual slavery which these conditions manifest. It is not at all surprising that a ruling power which thus violates the fundamental principles of justice and true political economy should find itself in danger of losing a valuable territory altogether as a result of its policy. Strong in their treaty-rights, encouraged by the connivance of the ruling power at their encroachments on individual rights and freedom, the priests are ever alert, keen and aggressive in the political life of British America.

"RIEL's rebellion," which at one time threatened to sever Manitoba from the Empire, was caused by clerical intermeddling with the civil administration of that province, carried to an extreme that was fairly unbearable. Riel's rebellion was suppressed with some difficulty and bloodshed. It failed mainly because the oppressed people were at heart attached to the mother country and could not be dissuaded from their reliance on her general fairness, and their confidence that, sooner or later, she would, of her free will, remedy their heavy grievances. To some extent their hopes were justified by the event; but quite recently, the "fine Italian hand" of the Church has been deeply inserted in the coffers of the Manitoba school fund, and the agitation over this proceeding was intense at the last Parliamentary election, spreading, indeed, all over Canada, and shaking the Houses of Parliament at London. It appears that the Church won a substantial victory on that occasion, and we are informed that the settlement finally reached has greatly encouraged the bishops elsewhere in their work of "bossing the job" of the people at the polls. Canada is the country which some people would like to see annexed to the United States.

* * *

Apropos of annexation, I am reminded of a little episode. A certain New York daily was honestly and fairly conducted, in the true interests of the people, for many years. It made mistakes sometimes, like all papers and all men. But it had such a hold on public confidence that it was always credited with doing so honestly, by those whom it failed to mislead. It was a morning daily. There came a time when its proprietors desired to print an evening edition. In order to do this, they borrowed a large sum of money from a certain estate whose interests were inextricably entangled with those of our "Pacific railways." It is not too much to say that this ended the usefulness of the journal as a servitor of the people's welfare. Among other things in which it betrayed their interests and sought to bring trouble into the already too much troubled politics of the United States, was its strenuous advocacy of Canadian annexation. This it urged, because those to whom its soul, as well as body, was apparently mortgaged, had a formidable competitor in the Canadian Pacific line, and they looked upon annexation as a prelude to their getting control of that road, and "consolidating" it under the same management as their own, and thus depriving people of the benefits of competition between the two.

* * *

In the course of its performance of the work assigned to it by its masters, this journal was called upon to deal with the question of a united Church and State. The treaty rights, and the resultant position of the Roman Catholic Church in several provinces, were pointed out by some authorities in Canada as insuperable obstacles in the way of an organic union with our country—"for," said they, "you cannot have an established church in the United States." Hastily the paper in question flew to the rescue. It assured the Canadians that they could come into our union with their church in each province established, because the Federal Constitution prohibited only a Federal church, and left the States free to unite themselves individually with any church, in the work of government! This is true. But what are we to think of a paper capable of thus pointing out an unfortunate omission in our fundamental law and inviting people to join our union whose institutions are utterly incompatible with the spirit of our American system—and all for the sake of "wrecking" a railroad?

* * *

Or late years there has been a noticeable tendency to carp at the Christian Bible. The authorship of its various books; the authenticity of its historical accounts; the question of how far each part is entitled to the adjective "inspired;" the character, as allegorical or otherwise, of many statements; etc., etc.—all of these matters and many like them have been and are still being threshed over in a spirit of decidedly hostile criticism by many writers.

* * *

The latest conspicuous clerical attempt to weaken the Bible has been made by "Rev." Lyman Abbott, who occupies the pulpit formerly filled by the famous Henry Ward Beecher. Mr. Abbott has officially stated that he does not believe the narrative of Jonah and the whale. There was no particular reason, apparent on the surface, why Mr. Lyman Abbott should have chosen a certain occasion to disavow belief in this story. As far as known he had not been asked by anybody whether he believed it or not. Certainly there were plenty more things in the Bible about which a man of his intelligence might have talked in the pulpit besides Jonah and his adventure. It is hardly conceivable that the reverend gentleman had exhausted all other texts, or his ability to deal with them to the edification of his hearers. Why Jonah and the whale just now?

* * *

There is an answer to this question which is plausible enough to consider, if it be not very creditable to the gentleman in question. It is a fact that among the numerous evils which the cheapness of publication and the development of sensational journalism have brought upon mankind, the cultivation of a morbid craving after notoriety is one of the worst. The desire to have one's name known—to be talked about—of course existed and played its part in human action from the beginning. But before the printing press came this desire could not have more than a comparatively limited gratification. At present, if one does anything curious or remarkable, or out of the way, next morning millions of men will be eagerly discussing the affair in all its phases, and thousands will avail themselves of the first opportunity to see—and, if he is a preacher, to hear—the man who, under other conditions, would neither know nor care anything whatever about him.

* * *

The human mind is so constituted that nothing seems to it more curious and remarkable than to find a man discrediting his own calling. If a very prominent allopathic physician, for example, were to suddenly "come out" in an "interview" repudiating all the standard works of his profession, denying their statements, denouncing their theories, condemning their advice, and yet continue to practice according to his chosen system, people would certainly like to read all about it, and he would be covered with cheap "glory" of the modern newspaper sort. It is just the same way with a preacher who repudiates the Bible or impeaches its authority, and still goes on preaching. Every one recognizes this as a remarkable phenomenon in the world of mind. The man's words acquire an importance that is largely factitious, the dailies print them with flaming head-lines, and the free advertising thus obtained is nearly co-extensive with civilization.

* * *

Our friend "Bob Ingersoll" goes around the country lecturing on "Why I Am An Agnostic." But the good-natured colonel labors under an hallucination when he imagines that very many persons care a particle to learn why he is an agnostic. There are plenty of agnostics outside the churches, and, for that matter, such may be found, occasionally, in some pews of a Sunday. No doubt all of them have reasons sufficient to themselves for being agnostics. An agnostic outside of the church is not sufficiently rare to be interesting. Even an agnostic in his pew on Sunday may be explainable. But an agnostic in a Christian pulpit is indeed a great curiosity and mystery.

* * *

Possibly it was a mere coincidence. But very soon after the "Associated Press" and the "United Press" had flashed to San Francisco and Europe the information that the Rev. Lyman Abbott did not believe the story of Jonah and the whale and was anxious for us all to know it, the Rev. Lyman Abbott went forth to lecture. A man of his position would probably draw a fair audience if he appeared under competent auspices, in a large city, purely on his merits. But, coming as he did to a southern town, in the character of an independent Bible critic, who had just been preaching Ingersollism in his own church, he commanded at least ten times as much attention as he could possibly have gotten had he arrived unheralded save by the paid announcements of his proposed lectures in the advertising columns of the newspapers.

* * *

The reverend gentleman said nothing new in the course of his lectures, and did not, according to the dispatches, put the old truths of life and death and sin and suffering and redemption in any specially forcible or striking way. Only one remark seems to call for notice. It is reported that he proclaimed it to be the duty of government to find out what is the will of God, and to enact that will into laws! This is the political philosophy at present accepted by a class of profound thinkers out in the grand old State of Kansas, and they are now trying their very best to apply their theories to the work of practical legislation. The first step in this direction has been the introduction of a bill whereby it is "enacted by the legislature of Kansas: Thou shalt have no other gods before me"! and so on, through the rest of the Decalogue.

* * *

The Rev. Lyman Abbott would admit at once the absurdity if not the blasphemy of such a legislative act as this, were it brought to his attention. Yet it is nothing but a sincere effort to do just what he says ought to be done—to "enact the will of God into laws." Nobody doubts that Mr. Walters, who introduced this bill, and declares that he did so in all seriousness, and desires to see it passed—no one doubts the verity of his belief that the Decalogue is "the will of God;" and so his performance is directly in accordance with Mr. Lyman Abbott's advice. The fact is, the learned clergyman gave this recommendation under the dominating influence of that old notion that law, somehow or other, is connected with morality. Blackstone blundered in precisely the same way—but that is another story, and will do for next week.
