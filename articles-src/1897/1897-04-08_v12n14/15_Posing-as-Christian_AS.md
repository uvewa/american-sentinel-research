The nations of the earth are usually represented in the Bible by wild beasts. This custom is not uncommon among the nations themselves. As examples, England is symbolized by a lion, Russia by a bear, etc., the United States being symbolized by an eagle.

In the Bible different symbols are sometimes used to represent the same governments, thus, in Dan. 7:5 Medo Persia is symbolized by a bear, but in 8:3 by a ram. The obvious reason is that no one symbol could express all the leading characteristics of the nations represented. This is true also of the United States. In the Bible this Government is emblemized by a two-horned beast, in profession lamblike, but in legislation, in some respects, dragonic.

It is doubtless well known to the reader that National Reformers, so called, have been seeking, especially since 1863, to so change the Constitution of this Government, or otherwise, as to compel the nation to pose as Christian. They have in part accomplished their purpose except as to changing the Constitution, and the result has been to compel as it were, the two-horned beast to stand upright upon his hind feet and say, "I am a Christian," or to force the "Eagle" to scream, "I am a dove." No given Congress of the United States has yet given evidence of being unduly pious, and should such a desideratum be realized the very next Congress might wofully backslide. Evidently National Reformers have a hard task on their hands to keep the poor doggy standing.
