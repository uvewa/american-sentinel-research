The recent action of the ministers of Cleveland, Ohio, in the direction of suppressing Sunday base ball in that city by law, drew from a lady resident the following reply, which the said ministers might ponder with profit:—

"Editor Press: The advocates of all Sunday laws pose as friends of law and order, and assert that all they want is obedience to the law. The clergy have no more to do with the ethics of law than any other citizens.

"They are employed to promulgate the religious dogmas of their respective organizations, and have no right to enforce their ideas of morality upon the base ball team or any one else.

"The observance of Sunday is an act of worship, and what is not of faith is sin. Hence, to compel the base ball team to observe Sunday, according to the conscience of the self-appointed religious committee, would be compelling them to sin. It is self-evident that if the ball players had any regard for Sunday they would observe the day without compulsion.

"What would the attitude of the clergy be should the base ball teams send a committee to command them not to preach on Sunday. But they will say, 'We have a law forbidding base ball on Sunday, and the law must be enforced. So they said when Jesus was on earth: 'We have a law and Jesus must die by that law.' Like all Sunday laws, it was made in the interest of a certain religion. Ministers were ordained to minister the gospel and not civil law.

"Judge Brown, of New York, said of Sunday laws: 'We do not believe that this gross and ridiculous interference with the private life of citizens can be justified. Where there is no disorder involved, no wrong done, no act performed that is of itself evil, each proceeding is not within the sphere of acts that can be justly regulated by law.' Mrs. S. G. Wood."
