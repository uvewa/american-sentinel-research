In answer to the question "What is Christian Citizenship," the May Christian Endeavorer says that,—

"We must not confuse the 'Christian citizen' with the idea of the Christian business man, Christian mechanic, Christian father, Christian soldier, or Christian church member; but the 'Christian citizen' is one who brings Christian principles to bear upon his political life."

In regard to which it may be said that the Christian, merely as such, is a Christian business man, Christian mechanic, Christian father, and Christian in every other relation of his life; for Christianity covers the entire range of life's activities. And as the "Christian citizen" is "not to be confused" with this, it plainly follows that something different from this Christianity regulates his conduct as a "Christian citizen."

And such, indeed, is the case; for in politics the aim is to compel men to a certain course of conduct; while Christianity knows no compulsion, but simply says, "Whosoever will, let him come."
