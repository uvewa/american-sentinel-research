In 1830 the Congress of the United States in its famous Sunday mail report, referring to that consciousness of certain inalienable rights felt by every man, said:—

"It is an inborn principle which nothing can eradicate. The bigot, in the pride of his authority, may lose sight of it, but strip him of his power, prescribe a faith to him which his conscience rejects, threaten him in turn with the dungeon and the fagot, and the spirit which God has implanted in him rises up in rebellion and defies you."

It is not often that bigots are thus called upon to take their own medicine, but sometimes in a milder way the principle is no less forcibly illustrated, as will be shown in the following.

Everybody is doubtless acquainted with the position taken during the last Presidential campaign by most of the influential journals of the country on the question of criticism of decisions of the Supreme Court. Of these journals not one was more "conservative" than the New York Evening Post. To question the infallibility of this tribunal, even when a decision was made possible by a majority of only one vote, was to it the essence of anarchy, and, if indorsed by the people, the premonition of certain ruin. So sincerely did it believe this that it made a strong effort to induce the editors of these journals to establish a censorship upon the telegraphic reports and to expunge from the speeches of the "anarchists" all that would tend to lead the simple people astray. But most of these papers, though of the same political faith and maintaining the same doctrine in regard to the Supreme Court, were hardly ready to swallow the assumption that they were the guardians of public thought, or that the people had lost their ability to read and decide for themselves.

Imagine then their astonishment and disgust when they beheld this foremost exponent of judicial absolutism turn and rend this august tribunal when it made the recent decision upon the anti-trust law. The scales seemed to have fallen from its eyes and it says this is one "of the long list of decisions . . . in which the court has revealed its weak grasp of the fundamental principles of law and government." According to the Post's own definition such disrespectful language is anarchy, and the Times-Herald, of Chicago, determined to be consistent in its support of the Supreme Court, says that owing to the class of people which the Post assumes to address, it is anarchy that will have the worst effect.

While it is true that circumstances sometimes alter cases—or rather our view of them—they cannot alter facts and principles. But what are the circumstances in this case? The decisions were rendered by the same court, with the same authority, and made possible by the same number of votes. One was said to be in the interests of the rich, the other was not. The Post indorsed one, the other it did not. In one case the court is infallible, in the other it reveals "its weak grasp of the fundamental principles of law and government."

Now, if the Supreme Court is infallible when it agrees with us, and has only a "weak grasp of fundamental principles," when it does not, it follows that the infallibility rests with us, not with the court. And it may be said that there never was a man—indeed it may be safely said that there never will be a man—who has asserted, or who will assert the absolute finality of any action of the Supreme Court of the United States simply because it is an action of the court, who would not deny the doctrine the very moment a decision was rendered which he thought to be against his interests. So then, let us not say that either our own opinion, or the opinion of the Supreme Court, is final. Let us say that justice, and justice alone, is the ultimate standard. Let us maintain the doctrine that "nothing is settled until it is settled right."
