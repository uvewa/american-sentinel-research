On April 24th last, a decision was rendered by two judges in the District Court of Stearns County, Minn., which forbade the conducting of religious exercises in the public schools of Avon. The case was that of Oliver Rasnick, plaintiff, vs. Common School District No. 60. The decision sets forth that religious services which included repetitions of the Lord's Prayer and prayers to "Mary, mother of God," had been regularly conducted in the school from the time of the organization of the school district, without objection from its patrons, until the commencement of the school year of 1896; and that after complaint had been made by the plaintiff and others to these exercises, "a majority of the legal voters of said school district petitioned the trustees thereof to permit and authorize the school house in said district to be used for the purpose of divine worship and for the purpose of instruction in religious matters and religion, the same not to interfere with the use of the school house for school purposes, which petition was granted and notice thereof was by the said trustees given to the defendant."

The practical working of this permission is an interesting feature of the case, and is set forth in the decision (in part) as follows:

"Four or five minutes before nine o'clock in the forenoon the children were called together in the school room, the pupils required to stand and together repeat the following prayer: 'Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven; give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.—Amen.' And also the following: 'Hail, Mary, full of grace! the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God! pray for us sinners, now, and at the hour of our death.—Amen.'

"Then without any intermission or further calling the school to order, the school exercises proper were begun and continued to twelve o'clock. Then, without any dismissal of the school, or intermission, the said prayers were repeated; pupils desiring to do so, however, being permitted to retire before the saying of these prayers. The school was then formally dismissed for the noon hour. Four or five minutes before one o'clock the school was called to order and the pupils directed to stand and repeat the following prayer: 'The Angel of the Lord declared unto Mary, and she was conceived of the Holy Ghost. Hail, Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners, now, and at the hour of our death.—Amen. Behold the handmaid of the Lord. May it be done unto me according to thy Word. Hail, Mary,' etc., as above, 'And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us. Hail, Mary,' etc., as above, closing with the Lord's prayer, as before stated.

"Immediately upon the conclusion of this prayer, and without any intermission or further calling of the school to order, the school exercises proper followed, and continued till four o'clock. At four o'clock the teacher announced 'School is out, and those who wish to go may go.' Then, without further dismissal or intermission, the same prayers were said and the same ceremony had which was followed, on two days of each week, by one half hour instruction in the Catholic catechism. There was no formal dismissal of the school, further than the teacher saying that those who wished to do so could go."

It will be observed that the teacher (a devout Catholic) took pains to minimize the force of the permission to leave the school before the religious exercises began, by proceeding immediately with the latter after a mere perfunctory notice to the young pupils of permission to those who wished, to depart. It is proper to note, also, that nothing would be easier than for an unscrupulous or religiously biased teacher under such circumstances to so manage affairs as to practically nullify, to a great extent, the liberty of absence from religious exercises which is thought to be a safeguard against injustice. In the case of young children, especially—and these are the very ones that ought to be most jealously guarded—such a provision could be easily deprived of its force by an artful teacher.

The decision is eminently just, and will, we hope, serve as a precedent in all similar cases that may arise in the future.
