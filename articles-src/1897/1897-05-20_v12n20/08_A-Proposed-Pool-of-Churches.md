At an interdenominational meeting of the "Congregational Club" in the Third Congregational church of San Francisco, May 4, the statement was made by one speaker and liberally applauded, that "There are 100 churches too many in the State of California, and if they should die off it would be the best thing for the kingdom of God."

This utterance seemed to strike the key-note for the meeting, and another speaker expressed the opinion that "A commission should be appointed representing all the evangelical churches, to arrange the placing of churches according to population. As to what churches should be placed in any one city, let priority of establishment determine."

After further remarks in support of this idea, a resolution was adopted unanimously providing (as reported in the San Francisco Call) "that steps be taken preparatory to the establishment of a State commission, which shall have for its object the placing of evangelical churches according to population."

This of course means nothing less than a "pooling" of the popular churches for their own interests and against such denominations as do not have "population" on their side. While the thought was not expressed at the meeting, and probably was not contemplated, there can be no doubt that the practical working out of this idea would result in arraying the more powerful and popular church bodies against the numerically weaker ones, which of course will not be regarded by the church "pool" as being at all necessary to the interests of the community in which they exist.

Let the churches seek for the "unity of the Spirit." Any other kind of church union will be worse than the present disunion.
