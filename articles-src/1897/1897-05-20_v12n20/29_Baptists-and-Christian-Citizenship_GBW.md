*From "Baptist Principles of Religious Liberty." by Geo. B. Wheeler.*

THE Christian Endeavor Convention which met at Boston, July, 1895, in which the Baptists were largely represented, declared itself as standing for Christian citizenship:—

"Christian Endeavor stands always and everywhere for Christian Citizenship."—*Official Report, Fourteenth International Christian Endeavor Convention, Boston, 1895, p. 345, Resolution Six.*

Christian citizenship, as defined by the Christian Citizenship League, an organization endorsed by the president and secretary of the Christian Endeavor Society, is:—

"To reveal Jesus Christ as the Saviour of the nation as well as of the individual."—*The National Christian Citizenship League Constitution, Art. 2.*

"Christian citizenship maintains the supreme right of Jesus Christ to rule municipal and national as well as private life."—*The Christian Citizen, (Chicago), October, 1893, p. 7.*

The heading to a call recently sent out by the Christian Citizenship League, reads:—

"In the name of the Lord of Hosts. A summons to the followers of Christ to unite against his enemies."—*The Christian Citizen, October, 1895, p. 3.*

We give two quotations from the call to show its character:—

"The forces of evil are organized, aggressive, insolent, triumphant. Is it not time to marshal the hosts of righteousness in battle array?" "If the prayer, 'Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven,' is ever answered, the people of God must do a twofold work; as in Neh. 4:16–18 where, trowel in one hand and sword in the other, they simultaneously rebuilt the walls of the holy city, and fought the enemy."

Do not these statements clearly indicate a turning away from the power of God which is the gospel, to the carnal weapons of civil warfare, for the purpose of accomplishing the will of Christ here upon earth? And yet this call was endorsed by a large number of the leading clergymen of the country, including many prominent Baptists.

At the Christian Endeavor Convention, held at Washington, D. C., July, 1896, great prominence was given to the subject of Christian citizenship. Fifty-three pages of the Official Report are devoted to this theme, besides the space devoted directly to its kindred theme,—compulsory Sunday observance. Baptists were largely represented in this convention. It is a marvel that Baptists could acquiesce in the sentiments expressed on that occasion, and printed in the Official Record. One statement reads as follows:—

"One purpose of this great Christian Endeavor movement is to enthrone Christ in our national life. . . . To illustrate: Christ got into our national life when the Pilgrim Fathers, in the cabin of the 'Mayflower,' entered into that solemn compact, setting forth that they had undertaken that perilous voyage for the purpose of planting a colony for the glory of God and the advancement of the Christian faith, and pledged themselves to frame civil institutions with that end in view. To that pledge they and their descendants were loyal for the next five generations."

Is it possible that Baptists have forgotten what they suffered under this attempt to "enthrone Christ in our national life"? Have they forgotten the cruel scourging and banishment they suffered under it? or have they repudiated the principles of separation of Church and State for which their fathers struggled and suffered for those five generations? If Roger Williams were here, would he acquiesce in this "Christian Citizenship" movement? or sit in silence while the principles for which he strove and sacrificed are repudiated? Can it be possible that the Baptist church will confirm the enemies of Christianity in their charge that as soon as a weak and persecuted church becomes strong, it repudiates its plea for liberty, and uses the civil power—the weapon of its persecutors—to oppress its dissenting brethren? Verily the editor of the *Indiana Baptist* speaks the truth when he says:—

"Roger Williams should be on earth again to teach some Baptists that 'the civil magistrate has no authority to punish the breaches of the first table of the Decalogue.'"—*Indiana Baptist, April 18, 1895.*
