*From the "Ram's Horn," Chicago.*

The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Arch-angel and with the trump of God. 1 Thess. 4:16.

That is one of the few prophecies which are unfulfilled. Unlike some of those of old, it is not veiled in the language of mysticism and symbol. It is as plain and explicit as words of one syllable can make it. It is as sure of being fulfilled as those prophecies have been which foretold, with surprising minuteness, the birth of Christ and his impressive death. It is as sure of being fulfilled as was that prophecy concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, which, indeed, came to pass with shocking realism. What if the trump should sound to-day, or when Christmas bells peel in celebration of the nine hundredth anniversary of Christ's birth, what would Gabriel and his host of angels find were they to bring to the great ingathering the nations of earth from the east, and the west, and the south, and the north?

Tearful vision for the Master. They would bring him a thousand million souls, two thirds of the world's number who, nineteen centuries after his death and resurrection at Calvary, never heard that he had lived. He would also find his nominal church, not one and united as he charged it to be, but broken up into one hundred and eighty or more distinct sects or divisions, working (so far as they work at all), without practical harmony and often with warring envy. He would find three thousand churches in America alone belonging to what are known as the more evangelical bodies absolutely without a single accession by confession of faith last year. He would find the world in which the church moves and is supposed to exercise its influence, plunging in a frenzied pursuit of riches, or pleasure, or empty fame. He would find, in short, just about such a scene as our artist pictures on page one. If the trump should sound there would not be mountains nor hills enough in the world to hide the terrified throng who would call upon these to hide them, but who are living from moment to moment as if life was an everlasting play day or a dream. It will yet appear that it is a solemn reality.
