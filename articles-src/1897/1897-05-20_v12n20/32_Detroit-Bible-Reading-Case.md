A Detroit (Mich.) judge has granted a mandamus against the use of "Readings from the Bible" in the public schools of that city. The Michigan Christian Advocate, of May 15, says that this is a point scored by "opponents of the Word of God." But the Word of God itself teaches the equal rights of all classes of people.
