*By Rev. Arthur S. Burrows.*

The fourth principle for which a Baptist Church stands is, that we refuse and oppose all connection between Church and State, believing that the State has no right to control religion. Conscience must be left untrammeled and so protected as the inalienable right of all, mankind being accountable to God only for its exercise.

Each is to follow personal conviction of duty in obeying God, without interference, and each is bound to extend the same right to all others without distinction. We believe that civil government is of divine appointment for common human good [Rom. 13:1-5], that we are to render tribute and honor where due [Romans 13:6, 7], and that we are to pray for rulers and magistrates [1 Tim. 2:1-4]; but we claim that Jesus Christ, whom God has exalted as King of kings and Lord of lords, is the prince of the converted conscience [James 4:12].

Baptists stand for religious freedom among all citizens and repel all State distinctions for political ends. Soul freedom is the bulwark of religious liberty, the inevitable outgrowth of the New Testament principle that each must hear for himself, must repent for himself, must believe for himself, must confess Christ for himself, must be baptized on his own confession [Romans 14:22]. We come into this world one by one, we must go to Christ one by one for his pardoning grace, and we leave this world one by one to be rewarded according to our works if we be Christ's, and to be judged if we be not Christ's [2 Corinthians 5:10]. Hence the State has no authority over the religious beliefs and observances of men, whether orthodox or heretic, atheist or heathen.*
