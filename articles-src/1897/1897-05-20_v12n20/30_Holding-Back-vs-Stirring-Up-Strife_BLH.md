THE Lord is worthy to receive glory and honor and power, because he created all things, and for his pleasure they are and were created. Rev. 4:11.

When man sold out to Satan, the Lord, whose delights were with the sons of men (Prov. 8:31), loved man so much that he "emptied himself" (Phil. 2:7, R. V.) and came to the earth to seek and to save that which was lost.

That which God is more interested in than anything else in this world, is his people (Deut. 32:9), and when he divided the nations and separated the sons of Adam (verse 8) at the tower of Babel (Gen. 11:8), he determined the times before appointed, and set the bounds of their habitation (Acts 17:26), that they should seek the Lord; and if they should feel after him they would be sure to find him, for "he is not far from every one of us."

He gave all life and breath and all things; and when man sinned he put himself just as close to him as it was possible to get, even taking upon himself man's flesh and blood. Heb. 2:14.

God not only delivered up his Son for us all, but with him freely gave us all things. Rom. 8:32.

All the hosts of heaven are studying the plan of salvation (1 Peter 1:2; Eph. 3:10), and are ministering for them who shall be heirs of salvation. Heb. 1:14. They are God's host (Gen. 32:2), and Jesus is their Captain. Josh. 5:15. They know all things that are in the earth. 2 Sam. 14:20. They listen for the word of command from their Prince and hasten to do his bidding. Ps. 103: 19-22.

These ministers of God defeat the purposes of proud kings and turn the plans of nations to naught. 2 Chron. 32:21. When the angel who is placed in charge of any nation holds no longer with that nation, that nation goes to ruin. Dan. 10:20.

When a prince or ruler of any people rebels against the interests of God's people, the angel that is in charge of that field is held or bound in that place until he is able to influence the mind of the head of that nation in favor of God's cause, or is released by his Captain.

This truth is plainly set forth in Daniel 10. The prophet was fasting and praying for three full weeks (verses 3, 4). His prayer was heard from the very first and Gabriel was sent to answer it. The prince of Persia withstood him until his prince, Michael, came and released him (verses 12, 13, R. V. margin).

At the golden altar in the first apartment of the heavenly sanctuary, but near to the entrance of the second, the prayers of the saints are presented. Rev. 8:3. From this altar the prophet heard the voice of Michael that released the angels that had been detained in the country of the Euphrates, holding back the powers from engaging in general war. Rev. 9:13-15. The angels obeyed the command and the powers were turned loose.

From the pages of history, beginning with July 27, 1449, and continuing "an hour, a day, a month and a year" (391 years, 15 days), the student reads the account of slaughter, carnage and ruin that went with and followed in the track of "Apollyon," the "Destroyer," of prophecy,—the "Sultans" of history.

The "sure word of prophecy" points out the year, and even the very day,—Aug. 11, 1840—when the Sultan should surrender his independence. History records the fact of the fulfillment of that prophecy. From that time he has been restricted in his operations.

Why a stay in his awful work? Because Christ, about this time, was to enter upon his last work in the heavenly sanctuary for a lost world.

As he came before the holy law of God, to finish his work as priest, and saw ruin on every hand in the earth, he gave command to the angels to hold, not only the powers in the valley of the Euphrates, but in the world, until God's work should be finished. Rev. 7:1-3.

The powers may gather, statesmen may tremble, and the daily news may proclaim a general war inevitable; but God has said to the angels, "Hold the four winds (war and strife) until my servants are sealed in their foreheads."

To another he has said, "Go through the midst of the city and set a mark upon the foreheads of those that sigh and cry for the abominations that are done in the midst thereof." Eze. 9.

Christ came to seek and to save the lost. To us he says again, "Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me even so send I you." John 20:21.

Then let every minister in the land, let every Christian, stop proclaiming war, stop stirring up the powers to strive with one another, and unite with all heaven in the work of holding the strife. Let them take the gospel of Christ, which is the power of God to save men (Rom. 1:16), and go to sinners as Christ did.

Now is the time for every one who believes in the God that created the heavens and earth to stop presenting their petitions—prayers—to State or national legislatures, to kings or emperors, and to come boldly to the "Throne of Grace" and find help; for this is a time of great need. "Cursed is the man that trusts in man, that maketh flesh his arm. Jer. 17:5.

Let every one who knows God take up this law, even the law of ten commandments written in stone, and go as Paul did to the Corinthians, clothed with the spirit of the living God, and unite with God, Christ and the angels in writing it upon the fleshy tables of the heart. 2 Cor. 3:3. Then will they be workers together with God. 1 Cor. 3:9.
