A sample of the intoxication that is produced by imbibing religious error is given in the Christian Endeavorer for May. Mr. G. L. Wilson, having evidently read and assimilated the Rev. Mr. Gamble's "great discovery" concerning the Sabbath, writes the following:

"When Jehovah finished his six days of work, he did not set apart Saturday as a rest, but gave us the astronomically true Sunday, September 27th, A. M. (not Julian). When the ceremonial law was given, after the Sunday sabbath seemed forgotten in Egypt, the tenth to sixteenth Nisan week was given at Passover time, in the year 25, 10 A. M. [2510 A. M.?], at which time Friday to Saturday was the seventh day of the ceremonial week—only ceremonial; and this date of the month would come on different days in different years, as the Fourth of July comes on different days of the week in different years. In the year 2550 A. M. the manna showed Sunday as the Sabbath. In the year A. D. 30, prophecy showed Sunday, April 7 (9th Julian), to be the restored Adamic Sabbath (not the ceremonial Jewish). It was man's first day of the new creation, but God's seventh day."

Let the reader contrast this jumble with the clear simple, straightforward language of the fourth commandment, and then thank the Lord that he does not have to try to look through a tortuous maze of assumption and supposition to discover his duty with regard to the Sabbath.
