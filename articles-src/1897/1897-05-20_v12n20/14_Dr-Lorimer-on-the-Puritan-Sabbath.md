THE Rev. Geo. C. Lorimer, who has for several years past been connected with the Tremont Temple church, Boston, Mass., evidently desires no reëstablishment in this country of the "Puritan sabbath." On a recent Sunday he spoke to his congregation on this point, the following, as reported in the Haverhill Gazette, of May 5:—

"The term 'Christian sabbath' was unknown for the first twelve centuries of Christian history. The term 'sabbath' as applied to the Lord's day is unknown to the articles, the canons and the prayer book of the church of England. The Christian idea of the day is of a day of worship, refreshment, rest, peace, joy, liberty. The duty is therefore incumbent upon every Christian to claim these privileges for himself and for all persons committed to his care, and, as far as in him lies, to obtain and preserve it for the whole brotherhood of man.

"Many eminent churchmen have rejoiced during the past few years because of the opening of the art museums and public libraries during a portion of Sunday, yet this boon was the result of years of agitation, and the men and women whose unrelenting demands secured the privilege were denounced as heretical persons who were planning the general wreck of Christianity.

"When the Sunday evening concert was tolerated in Boston the amusement places were crowded every Sunday evening by non-going church people and the streets kept clear of that mob of aimless persons who always throng the public streets during an idle day. Certain churchmen concluded that the Sunday concert was responsible for the small attendance at the evening church service, and acting upon this impression they demanded the police to interfere. What was the immediate result? Every hotel and brothel in the city became crowded and the churches did not gain a respectable increase. Under the Sunday concert plan men were able to go to work on Monday morning, while under the present arrangement they are unable to do so owing to the debauch of the Sunday evening.

"If Sunday be made a day of gloom in this State the inevitable penalty will be loss of commercial importance and the creation of a class of human beings who will be skillful in evading the penalty of law, while indulging in a state of lawlessness which will endanger Christianity."

Why not leave the Sabbath just as it was left to mankind by the Creator?
