*Michigan "Christian Advocate," May 1.*

In the *Michigan Catholic*, of 26th ult., appears an article on "Freedom and Catholicity," signed by "Veritas." After speaking of the freedom and justice of the American Government, and some of the principles underlying civil power, the writer concedes that the Roman Catholic church derives benefit from the American form of government, especially as to spiritual progress and administrative facilities, but thinks that the Republic, in guaranteeing equal rights to all churches and special privileges to none, restricts the inherent power of Romanism. He then says:—

"The State has no national church, and therefore she regards all churches as equal, *i. e.*, as an organized society; consequently by the law of equity she concedes to none the privileges she does not allow another, and so the Catholic church, while enjoying a freedom common to others, is restrained from her own lawful power to suppress heresy. This, in itself, is an evil. However, the remedy is not in the power of the Catholic church under existing conditions, so instead of stamping out heretical doctrines, which is one of her missions, she strives by every possible means to infuse a true Catholic spirit into the individual, and even goes so far as to carry her crusade against error into the enemies' camp, by conducting missions to non-Catholics."

It is well understood that the Roman Catholic church considers it "one of her missions" to "stamp out heresy" and it is on this very account that Protestant Americans prize their form of government. Thank God that under it there can be no such bloody suppressions of heresy as the persecutions of the Albigenses, the holocausts of the Inquisition or the massacre of St. Bartholomew. The world has seen enough of that sort of thing. Heresy may be provoking and even hurtful, but the Roman Catholic method of suppressing it is repugnant to every sense of right and justice. Because that church still claims "her own lawful power to suppress heresy," we are devoutly grateful that a more just and humane civil power has stepped right in and practically says with Luther—"To burn heretics is contrary to the will of the Holy Ghost."
