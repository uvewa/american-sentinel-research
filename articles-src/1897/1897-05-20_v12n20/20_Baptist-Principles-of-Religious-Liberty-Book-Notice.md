"BAPTIST Principles of Religious Liberty," by Geo B. Wheeler, an advertisement of which appears on another page, is destined to accomplish great good in stirring up the pure minds of Baptists to earnestly contend for the faith once delivered to the saints along the lines of "soul liberty." The author has received warm endorsements of his pamphlet from prominent Baptist preachers and editors, college presidents and professors, both north and south.

Rev. Arthur S. Burrows, whose ringing words on Church and State we print on another page, writes thus of the pamphlet:—

"My Dear Mr. Wheeler:—

"I thank you for your courteous permission to peruse your "Baptist Principles of Religious Liberty." They are righteous, because based upon the principles of Christ. They are essential, because the only assurance of both individual and national life. Your statement of these principles is a fresh inspiration to simple Christianity, pure church membership, and patriotic citizenship.

"Accept a contribution of mine during 1896, and my best wishes.

"Sincerely yours,

"Arthur S. Burrows."
