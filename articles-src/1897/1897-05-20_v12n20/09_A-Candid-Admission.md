The "Rescue of the Sabbath in California" is the topic of a communication from Rev. William Rader, of San Francisco, to the May Christian Endeavorer. In it Mr. Rader mentioned that since 1883 California has had no Sunday law, and adds that the California climate invites Sunday desecration (which is obviously true,) and then says:—

"I would not make the impression that the California sabbath is worse than that of Illinois or Massachusetts, or any other State. . . . If California is not what it ought to be, morally, the climate is not wholly responsible. The San Francisco sabbath is observed quite as well as the Chicago sabbath."

In other words, Sunday desecration is no worse in California, where there is no Sunday law, than in Illinois, Massachusetts, or "any other State," where Sunday laws exist, notwithstanding that the California climate is unusually conducive to indulgence in the various forms of Sunday recreation.

Of what use, then, are Sunday laws in the States? What do they accomplish more than to manufacture "crime," by causing the arrest of people for doing what is allowed to be good and lawful on other days of the week!

Where there is the most of the law of God in the heart, the Sabbath will be best observed. But only the Spirit of God can write his law in men's hearts.
