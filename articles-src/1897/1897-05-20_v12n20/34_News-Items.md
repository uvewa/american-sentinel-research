SUNDAY, May 16, the Cleveland baseball club will make a test of the Ohio Sunday law by attempting to play a game in that city. Chief of Police Abbott was notified that the large crowd which would be present to see the game would be likely to mob the police if the latter interfered with the exhibition, and he replied, "I shall have an adequate force present to prevent the game, and if necessary the police will be supplemented by the militia." The president of the Cleveland ball team has announced that in case of such interference he will transfer the club to Detroit.

THE "League of American Wheelmen" have put themselves on record as opposed to Sunday bicycling; but it is reported that California and some other Western States are not in harmony with the organization on this point, and may form a league of their own.

THE "majesty of the law" was vindicated recently in New York City, it is said, in the following manner:—

"The city of New York wished to get some property for the approach to the new bridge across the East River. The city owns the property, but the only way that it could be obtained for this purpose was for the city to sue itself in condemnation proceedings. This was duly decided, the Supreme Court has affirmed it, and the city of New York now pays twenty-nine thousand dollars to itself for the land."
