In a communication to the Cottonwood County Citizen (Windom, Minn.), of Feb. 6 last, taking exception to Sunday evening games and amusements, Mr. C. S. Royse says:—

"There are two institutions which may be looked on as distinctly American—the American sabbath and the American saloon."

Such an admission is fatal to the "American sabbath"; for any institution that takes its rise from the same source whence comes the American saloon, can have no just claim to sanctity. As certainly as the "American saloon" is an American institution, so certain it is that no other American institution can be holy. And no Sabbath is worth anything that is not holy.

The "Sabbath of the Lord" (see Exodus 20:8-11) is holy. The "American sabbath" is but a human institution, and hence has no holiness.
