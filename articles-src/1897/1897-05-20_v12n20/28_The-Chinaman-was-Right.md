"Bible Echo." Melbourne, Aus.

A CHINESE grocer in Sydney, says the Sydney Daily Telegraph, of March 18, when asked by a "city missionary" to sign the Churches' Sunday-closing petition, carefully inquired what the petition meant. "To enforce the closing of all shops on Sunday." "Oh, me close every Sunday and all holidays." "Then sign, and make those close who do not." "No, me no sign; me close myself, not trouble about anybody else." The Chinaman was right. There was evidently more religious freedom slumbering in his bosom than was manifested by the "missionary" who asked him to sign the petition, or the Sanhedrimitish "Council" that sent this "missionary" out with its gospel of compulsion.
