A WHITER in the Christian Advocate, lamenting the destruction of the Armenians by the Kurds and Turks, and suggesting as the only possible way for the prevention of further atrocities the union of Great Britain and the United States against Turkey and Russia, says: "Of course, Christian America is horrified to think of the weary tramp of myriad feet over the blood-stained track to far-away Siberia, fearful dungeons, dismal mines, the lash, the sword, the torture; but, notwithstanding all this, Russia has done much good in Central Asia, and it certainly is not just to call her a little better than Turkey." This was an allusion to what some other writer had said of Russia in the same paper.

After reading the above true description of Russian barbarism which this writer has portrayed, we can but wonder at his own conclusion that it is not just to call Russia "little better than Turkey." What does he want to call her? No better? No; he conveys the idea that Russia is a good deal better than Turkey.

The probabilities are that should this same writer desire to go on a Christian mission to either of these countries, he would prefer to go to Turkey, knowing that he could preach Christ freer from interruption in Turkey than in Russia. Religion is free in Turkey. And any man is free to preach his religion, provided he does not make his religion the means of stirring up rebellion against the government. In Russia any religion besides the Established Church is not allowed. Every other religion than the Greek Russian church is itself under the ban.

What, then, makes Russia so much better than Turkey? Nothing but the supposition that Russia, unlike Turkey, is a Christian nation! The good she has done in Central Asia is that she has conquered certain weak Mohammedan States and annexed them to her empire. But why go to Asia? What good has Russia done in Europe? How does she treat those who preach the gospel there? For them the road to Siberia is always open and always thronged. Russian cruelties, banishments and persecutions are made in the name of Christ, and not in the name of Mohammed. Should Russia gain possession of Turkey, the American missionaries now laboring in that country would have to leave immediately; and should the Armenians or Mohammedan Turks rise in rebellion when under the Russian government, the Russian Cossack would, under the orders of his "little father," the White Czar, show himself equal to the Bashi Bazouk and the Kurd.

National Christianity means but little, whether in Russia or the United States. To write it on paper looks well; but to be appropriately written, it should be written with blood,—not ink,—for it always has meant and always will mean persecution and death to dissenters. When Christian America is horrified at Russian persecutions, and Christian Russia is delighted with them, it is time that this national Christianity be analyzed to see of what it is composed. A close inspection will reveal in national Christianity a large amount of pride, priest-craft, bigotry, and love of power, and only the thinnest tinsel of Christianity to cover it—in fact, nothing but the name.

If the national Christianity of the United States is not as bad as that of Russia, it is because it is not yet so firmly established. Let national Christianity once be firmly fixed here, and this land will be a dreary place to the dissenter, who, perhaps, will be glad to seek an asylum under the government of some generous Mohammedan such as have ruled in the past. Yet, strange to say, the desire for a national religion, by law duly recognized and established, is very pleasing to many Americans.
