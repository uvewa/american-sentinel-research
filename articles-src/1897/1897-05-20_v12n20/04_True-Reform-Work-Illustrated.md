The well-known temperance worker, Francis Murphy, has recently been conducting gospel temperance meetings in Boston, with great success. Of the agency by which this success has been attained, he says:—

"From the first we had the presence and power of the Holy Spirit. Men who had been enslaved for years by intoxicating liquors signed the pledge, and reverently kneeling, with tears of repentance running down their faces, cried out, 'Lord, have mercy on me; deliver me from the power and dominion of sin.' Thank God, their prayers have been answered in complete deliverance from the drink habit and all other sinful conduct.

"The gospel of Jesus Christ has enabled us to come off more than conqueror in this great struggle with sin in the face of all the people of this classic city of Boston. The press of Boston gave me the most hearty and generous support from the first meeting to the finish, and the ministers also. All denominations heartily united in the name of Jesus Christ. It has been a Pentecostal time. We were all with one accord in one place at one time. Men were filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance. The city government were so favorably impressed with the work that they voted to give Faneuil Hall free of charge to me for the work."

And this is what might be done everywhere, if the effort for reform were but conducted by the divine Agency here brought to view. If Mr. Murphy had undertaken to conduct political temperance meetings instead of gospel temperance meetings, would any such success have crowned his efforts? Certainly not. The Spirit of God is the great reforming agency in this world, and without this no righteous reform can be accomplished. If the cause be righteous, its leaders may confidently look to God for the power to crown their efforts with success.

Alas, that so many reformers of this day should be grasping for political power, instead of seeking for the power of the Spirit!
