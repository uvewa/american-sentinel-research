It is reported that the Sultan not long since expressed his opinion of Leo XIII, by the remark, "Who is this pope that's always meddling in the affairs of our State?" the occasion being the presentation of a letter from the Pope to the Sultan, concerning the protection of Christians in Crete. The papal envoy was snubbed, the Pope was deeply offended, and a coldness has existed between the Porte and the Vatican ever since.
