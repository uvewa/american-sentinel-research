AS SHOWN BY A COMPARISON OF THE ANCIENT GLADIATOR WITH THE MODERN WAGE SLAVE.

"*Twentieth Century.*" July 17.

A LEARNED and elegant historian has devoted considerable vivid rhetoric to a presentation of the gladiatorial pastimes of old Rome. He tells us that these popular diversions were an amazing demonstration of the moral degradation of mankind in antiquity. "They display," he observes, with the irritating fatuity from which even the profoundest learning is not exempt, "more vividly than any mere philosophical disquisition the abyss of depravity into which it is possible for human nature to sink. They furnish us with striking proofs of the reality of the moral progress we have attained." Here we have an echo of the Pharisee who stood up in the temple to pray and thanked the Lord he was not as this publican.

The type of Roman imperial society being military its horrors were of a sanguinary character. The type of modern competitive society being industrial, its horrors are exempt from bloodshed, but they are horrors. Horror for horror, the ancient wage slave, the gladiator, was not more barbarously treated than the modern wage slave, the toiler. Posterity, which alone can pass final judgment upon this question, may reasonably be expected to conclude that if anything the wage slave of the nineteenth century was rather worse off than his fellow of the first.

Yet the gladiatorial shows of antiquity were undoubtedly horrible. They owe their origin, it seems, to religious fervor, and gladiators were hired at first to fight at funerals. They slew one another at great men's tombs in order to propitiate the immortal gods in favor of the deceased. The Roman nobles were in the habit of bequeathing large sums for this singular purpose. The individuals who witnessed these combats acquired a passionate taste for the excitement of them, and before very long the funeral of a rich man was the occasion for the gathering of an enormous mob eager to see the gladiators fight.

Two sons achieved some note for filial piety as early as 264 B. C. by compelling three pairs of gladiators to fight at the funeral of their father. Julius Caesar was the first to have these combats at the obsequies of a woman. He was so much attached to his daughter that when she died it required some unusually sanguinary fights to assuage his woe. At last the public appreciation of these contests acquired such intensity that the politicians provided them gratuitously for the voters. No candidate for high office under the Roman republic, and particularly during the career of Cicero, could hope to be elected unless he hired an army of gladiators to slaughter each other in the arena before the assembled people.

The number of these trained fighters in Rome became so large during the reign of Augustus that he felt alarmed and restricted their importation. He further deemed that no greater number than 120 should fight at once. His successor, Tiberius, endeavored in other ways to abate the ardor for gladiatorial spectacles, but in vain. The nobles maintained whole regiments of fighters in private gymnasia of their own. The games attained the most colossal proportions and the slaughter was on horribly wholesale scales. Even rich tradesmen kept their gladiators and exhibited them in ferocious battles as a means of attaining social position.

To the modern mind the scene in a Roman arena is all but incredible. Tens of thousands of spectators were seated about the ring. At the signal, wild animals, lions, tigers, elephants, wolves, all made savage by hunger and ill treatment, were brought within the circle. Then the gladiators emerged by the score and fell to fighting the beasts and one another until the arena swam with blood and the ground was heaped with corpses of the slain.

The gladiatorial shows demoralized the population on a vast scale. "It is abundantly evident," says Lecky, "both from history and from present experience, that the instinctive shock or natural feeling of disgust caused by the sight of the sufferings of man is not generally different from that which is caused by the sight of the sufferings of animals. The latter, to those who are not accustomed to it, is intensely painful. The former continually becomes by use a matter of absolute indifference." This is unquestionably true. We are not to suppose that the Romans lacked the finer feelings of humanity because they took delight in the sanguinary scenes of the circus. Far from it. The contemporaries of Cicero, of Virgil, of Horace, of Tibullus, gave abundant evidence of a nobility of mind and heart. . . . It simply happened that circumstances had made them utterly indifferent to human torture in a single respect.

If this seems incredible, we have but to look at the conditions prevalent in the industrial world to day. We see on every side an indifference to human suffering in comparison with which the ancient Roman delight in savage slaughter is almost altruistic. The wealthy classes now look upon the slow agonies of the exploited masses with amazing indifference. Nothing is more characteristic of the degraded state of contemporary public opinion than the calmness with which revelations of the atrocity of the wage system are contemplated. The facts brought to light by the miners' strike are ample proof of this curious fact. One father of a family maintains six children on thirty cents a day. His seventh child died from inhaling coal gas when a month old. In one mining settlement the children fought savagely for a quart of milk until one little boy of seven cut open the head of his brother with his father's pick.

Fifty per cent. of the children in the mining camps were born dead last year. Thirty per cent. of the mothers died in child birth. The miners spend fourteen hours daily under ground. They live on meat rejected by the Boards of Health of the large cities as diseased when they get any meat to live on. They drink alcohol by the pint to keep warm in winter. Their clothing is a black mass of grimy, filthy rags. Nor are these a tithe of their ills. Every day some terrible fact is brought to light indicating that an enormous population is kept in a condition of suffering and despair absolutely horrifying. But how calm and unmoved we remain in the face of all this. The condition of the miners of this country is so much more terrible than the lot of the gladiators in ancient Rome that we should be ashamed of the comparison.

Nor is the contrast more favorable in other directions. It was shown in this city two weeks ago that the men who run freight elevators at the large receiving stations remain on duty thirteen hours out of the twenty-four at a wage of $1.45 per day. Some of these men have families to support. The very mention of such a thing ought to make us blush with shame for our social system. Any man who observes the employés of the elevated railroad in New York can see they suffer from overwork and under pay. They are gaunt, hungry, miserable objects. Every corporation with a public franchise is an instrument for a like degradation of the working classes. These wretched men are on duty early and late. They are absolute slaves. The still more atrocious wage slavery of children is contemplated with equal indifference. When we pause to reflect upon the conditions of modern civilization we are appalled by the hideous abomination of them. Suffering, misery, degradation, exploitation, protrude themselves upon the notice of all, but we have grown so indifferent that we do not even care.

If an ancient Roman could be summoned to argue this matter with a modern American it would not be easy to see which ought to come out better in the discussion. The Roman could point out that the agony of the gladiators was a short one. They were well treated and liberally paid. They did not have to go hungry and naked most of the time. A death of utter exhaustion and debility, brought about by weary years of slow starvation and grinding penury can scarcely be preferable to slaughter in a crowded arena, with the chance of proving the victor and thus becoming the idol of the capital of the world.

The moral to be drawn from the gladiatorial shows is not that we are superior to the ancient Romans, but that the constant presence of human suffering makes us at last indifferent to it. The whole ethical tone of society has been lowered by the conditions of modern capitalism. This is why men, otherwise enlightened enough, will calmly advocate the most fiendish cruelties in order "to keep the mob in check." Such men are as savage and ferocious as the Roman nobles in the time of Tiberius.
