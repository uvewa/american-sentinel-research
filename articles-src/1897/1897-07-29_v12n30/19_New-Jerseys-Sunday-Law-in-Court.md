Four members of the Arlington, N. J., baseball club, were, on the 16th inst. tried in the Criminal Court in Jersey City, for alleged violation of the "Vice and Immorality" Act, the offense being that of Sunday ball playing. The trial is thus described:

"The defendants were playing ball on the previous Sunday, and were arrested by Captain McKaig and Detective Holtic at the instigation of the Rev. T. J. Kommers, pastor of the Lafayette Reformed church. They are members of the Arlington baseball club, which has inclosed grounds near the Reformed church, and they played in the presence of the officers for the purpose of being arrested and making a test case.

'Captain McKaig admitted that the Rev. Mr. Kommers had walked to the station on Sunday to make the complaint.

'Why didn't you arrest him for violating the law?' asked Lawyer Speer.

'He didn't violate any law,' answered the captain.

'Don't you know that it is a violation of the law to travel on Sunday except in a case of necessity or charity?'

'I do not.'

'Lawyer Speer read the statute, which provides 'that no traveling, worldly employment, or business, ordinary servile labor or work, either upon land or water (works of necessity or charity excepted), nor shooting, fishing, sporting, hunting, gunning, racing, or frequenting of tippling house, or any interludes or plays, dancing, singing, fiddling, or any music for the sake of merriment, nor any playing at football, fives, ninepins, bowls, long bullets or quoits, nor any other kind of playing sports, pastimes, or diversions shall be performed, used, or practised by any person or persons within this State on the Christian sabbath or first day of the week, commonly called Sunday.'

"The jury, after deliberating four hours, was unable to agree upon a verdict, and was discharged."
