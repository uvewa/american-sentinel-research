# News, Notes, and Comment.

The English and American attorney has always been notorious for his conservatism. The profession is not equally conspicuous for this quality, in France. Perhaps the difference may be partly accounted for by the fact that the French lawyer relies mainly on his appeal to abstract considerations, on reasons pure and simple to establish his case, whereas the advocate in the United States and Great Britain produces his "authorities" and brings to bear the force of history, so to speak. "It is a maxim of these fellows," said a wit of years gone by, "that whatever has been done before may be done again; this they call a respect for precedent." Constant appeals to precedent naturally imbue the mind with attachment to the past, and create mistrust and dislike of innovations.

* * *

Whatever the cause, the lawyer with us is the most conservative of men. "The thing as it is" suits his fancy, especially if it be a thing whose roots he can trace back into the hoary past, and whose growth he can mark through the rolling centuries. He receives, without appreciating, the suggestion that the thing as it is became so only by progress, by change, by cutting off part of this branch, by training those other limbs in a certain direction.

* * *

Now, conservatism is an excellent good thing in its way. And its way is that of a brake on the wheels of progress. To be always moving, yet to move with care and caution; to make haste slowly; to test by theory and practical experiment all suggested alterations in our modes of governing and of administration—this is the necessary condition of a healthy social organism. Violent and radical departures from the established state of things are justly to be deprecated; but decay soon attacks any system which has not the vitality that proves all things, and holds fast that which is good.

The antiquated and cumbrous phraseology of law-papers has been the theme of satire for laymen, but it has ever had a mysterious charm for the Bar; old customs are followed centuries after they originated, and after all the conditions that gave rise to them, and, in some manner, perhaps, justified their adoption, have passed away never to return. Principles are still gravely laid down in law-books which philosophy has long since abandoned as untenable; even fallacies of definition are clung to by law-writers for no other apparent reason than because they were once enunciated, by some eminent man, who wrote in the infancy of human intelligence, or under the fatal paralysis of personal interest or ambition.

* * *

No one has been more servilely followed in this regard than Mr. Justice Blackstone. The "hold" which his famous "Commentaries" have maintained on the legal mind is one of the most curious phenomena of psychology that have ever come under my observation. It is not too much to say that later authors, as a rule, approach this learned jurist with the awe of a neophyte at the shrine of some great god of old. The odor of sanctity exhales from the inspired pages, the words of Infallibility are received with bended knee direct from the throne.

* * *

The work of Mr. Justice Blackstone consists of law, history and philosophy. His law is obsolete, his history imperfect and misleading, his philosophy exploded. His English is excellent I admit, but his servility is disgusting, and he does not know the meaning of manliness or candor. Even when he seems able to "think straight, and see clear," he darkens his wisdom with the clouds of flattery, and "crooks the pregnant hinges of the knee where thrift may follow fawning."

* * *

The law with which Mr. Justice Blackstone had to deal was made by that same Parliament and King to whom Mr. Justice Blackstone was indebted for his official position. Of that law and of its makers the Justice was bound to speak with admiration, with reverence, with love, under the penalty of losing his salary. He discharged his talk with conspicuous skill; and, in so doing, he inoculated the fountain of our jurisprudence with a poison that contaminates it to this day, and will perhaps never be thoroughly eradicated.

* * *

"Law," says Mr. Justice Blackstone—meaning by "law" the creation of the power that created him a Justice—is a rule of civil conduct prescribing what is right and prohibiting what is wrong." And my conservative profession has gone on, repeating this dictum, poll-parrot-wise, ever since. I have just found it in a recently issued text-book, the writer whereof shows in more than one passage that he knew better, and that he transcribed this nonsense to the bewilderment and deception of coming generations, for no other reason than because Mr. Justice Blackstone had written it.

Of course, in the eyes of the latter, the government could do no wrong. It followed that the law of that government in the mass, and in every detail, was perfect, and that whatever it required was right, and whatever it forbade was the reverse. In fact, the distinction between right and wrong was itself the work of that law. A thing was right for no other reason than because the law commanded it, a thing was wrong for no other reason than because it was prohibited by law. "Government is based on the law of God," we were told. How then was it possible that the government should err?

* * *

It is nothing less than shameful that such erroneous views as Blackstone's should be steadily inculcated upon the minds of young men in our land. Lawyers play a leading part in our political life; they do much to guide and direct the course of public events; more than other men, they are, as a class, looked to for advice and opinion on the great problems of our complex system. What shall we say of those who pervert the understanding of our future lawyers at the very outset of their studies and do all in their power to send these young men forth to their work in the world with deluded and distorted brains?

* * *

A law may, it is true, command what is right. And it is also true that a law may prohibit what is wrong. But this is a mere accident in either case. The law does not command a thing because it is right, nor prohibit it because it is wrong. Neither does a thing become right because a law commands it, or wrong because a law forbids it. The right or the wrong of a thing is no element of the law in regard to it. And on the other hand, the legality or illegality of a thing has no connection whatever with its quality as right or wrong. A government may pass a law providing that its flag shall consist of red and white stripes, and fix their number; but it could not, by any enactment, make the red stripes white or the white stripes red, or make an odd number even, or an even number odd.

* * *

We get rid of much confusion when this distinction is properly established. For instance, we are sometimes told that it is the duty of all good citizens to obey the laws. But a good citizen has only one duty, as such, in this world; his sole duty is to do right. Once we eliminate the infallibility of law as a doctrine inconsistent with the facts of history and American principles of government, we see that it is by no means unthinkable that this duty of doing right may bring a good citizen directly in conflict with human law. To assume that such a law commands what is right and prohibits what is wrong is to assume for the law-making power the right of conscience over the community. But the right of conscience is an individual right which each person must exercise for himself. The legislature cannot determine questions reserved for the tribunal set up in the breast of every man. On the contrary, the acts of the legislature must themselves be arraigned before that tribunal and the rightfulness or wrongfulness of them must be there determined as in a court of last resort.

* * *

A very antique maxim of the law goes with the notion that it is concerned with the distinction between right and wrong—the maxim that there can be no wrong without a remedy. This is solemnly uttered now and then by our most erudite and profound jurists. But it is either false, or it is a mere truism. It is false, if it means that there is no moral wrong without legal redress. It is so far false, that many atrocious moral wrongs are and always have been not merely remediless at law, but actually accomplished by means of laws, sometimes passed for that express purpose.

* * *

It is a mere truism if it means that there is no legal wrong without a legal remedy. It appears as a truism in the Latin—"ubi jus iti remedium;" jus here means a legal right; remedium means a kind of action, or legal process; so that the significance of the sentence is simply that wherever a legal right exists, some form of practice may be found for its enforcement. In this sense, the maxim has been sometimes appealed to where the legislature has failed to specify the manner in which the provisions of a statute are to be availed of in the courts.

* * *

We see, then, that the law knows nothing, and cannot by any possibility know anything, of right or wrong; but is confined exclusively to dealing with rights and wrongs. And these rights and wrongs are altogether of its own creation, and exist by virtue of its will, and may, at any time, be reversed, and converted one into the other at its pleasure. In different communities and at different stages of the world's progress these rights and wrongs differ widely; because men's notions of what is expedient, or conducive to the social welfare, are by no means fixed or universal. But right and wrong are independent of epochs, as well as of latitude and longitude.

* * *

South Carolina for years had no divorce law. It was the opinion of her people that it was unwise to allow the severance of the marriage tie for any reason whatsoever. There was, therefore, no jus of separation for husband and wife, and no remedium, or procedure for securing it. Then the legislature passed a law allowing divorces under certain circumstances. At once, the jus arose. If no particular way of sifting the facts, or of adjudicating upon them had been provided, then the courts would have supplied the remedium. Later still, the law was repealed and jus and remedium fell together. But it is plain that the right of conjugal fidelity and the wrong of conjugal infidelity were always the same in South Carolina as they were everywhere else, and that the absence or presence of a statute on the subject did not in the least affect its moral aspect.

* * *

It is to be hoped that some day a writer will be found who will give us a book on the general principles of law which shall be, from beginning to end, American—faithful to American ideas, consistent with American public policy. Such a man must begin at the beginning. He must cut loose from Mr. Justice Blackstone altogether. He must frame his definitions for himself, and not copy the language of that commentator; he must carve out his conceptions as a sculptor chisels a new statue from the virgin marble, and not fancy that his task is merely the cleaning or polishing, or trimming of some ancient torso, dragged from the dust of the Feudal ages.
