# Preaching the Gospel in Spain.

Some degree of religious tolerance is accorded Protestant residents of Spain, and in the absence of permission to maintain regular houses of worship, the Protestant clergymen improve the opportunity occasionally afforded to preach the gospel to the open-air congregations which gather at funerals. One such incident is related by Rev. W. H. Gulick, missionary of the American Board, in a letter to the *Independent*, as follows:—

"A little child in the Protestant congregation in Bilbao died. There was nothing in the circumstances of the death to complicate the case. All the usual papers had been taken out, and every legal requirement had been complied with; but, when the funeral procession reached the city cemetery, the priest in charge refused to permit the burial until certain requirements imposed by himself had been met. Among other things he demanded that the parents should bring a certificate from the parish priest to the effect that the child had not been baptized in the Roman Catholic Church. This is not required by law, and the pastor refused to submit to the imposition. In the discussion that followed a large number of people gathered around the little coffin. Fortunately, the cemetery is comparatively near the town. Begging the friends to wait, the pastor ran down the hill, and quickly found himself in the presence of the mayor and of several aldermen who happened to be present. He at once explained the case, calling attention to the fact that the friends of the deceased were waiting in the cemetery. Though these gentlemen were all well-known Roman Catholics, they unanimously agreed that the official papers that the pastor showed them were quite legal and were all that were required, and they wondered that the priest in charge of the cemetery should have raised any obstacles to the burial. The mayor said: 'I will soon put it right,' and going to the telephone he called up the priest and had a conversation with him. In a moment he returned to the pastor, apologized for the annoyance that he had suffered, and assured him that there would be no further trouble.

"He hastened back, and was surprised and glad to find that the crowd had not diminished in numbers. With very poor grace the priest surrendered the coffin, and to the eighty or one hundred persons who were now gathered around the little grave, the pastor preached the gospel for more than half an hour, and the baffled priest had the chagrin of seeing that he had only provided the Protestant with an interested and attentive audience that otherwise he would not have had. And, as for himself, quite unexpectedly he had received a useful lesson in constitutional law."
