We are glad to say that already we are receiving many substantial evidences, in the way of good words and large lists, that our special offer on the SENTINEL as announced last week is being appreciated. Pledges of earnest effort in its behalf come from almost every State in the Union.

One State tract society secretary writes that his State alone will increase the list 2000; another says, "The offer you make can not fail to bring a large list of subscribers, for the price is a popular one, and the paper ought to be in the hands of the people everywhere." Another one writes, "We hope to have every friend of the cause in this State, as far as possible, a subscriber to the SENTINEL before the offer closes." Still another says, "We have sent out circular letters to all the librarians of the churches and also isolated friends of the paper, urging that they individually try to secure subscriptions for it in the various localities where they live. We have also written many personal letters to our workers to the same effect, which we feel sure will bring some good lists." Another encloses a personal note accompanying a nice list, saying, "I wish I could tell you how much I appreciate the SENTINEL. I think it is growing better and better, and has a place in the cause that no other paper can fill. You can count on us here doing everything in our power to get the paper more generally read." A president of a State conference writes, "The other day I met a man who has read the SENTINEL for only a few weeks, and who had never before known of it, and he said, 'I am astonished at the amount and excellent quality of the matter that this little sheet contains.'" A subscriber, sending a remittance, appends these words: "I cannot do without the AMERICAN SENTINEL. May God grant that you may live a thousand years, for every editor seems asleep but yourself." We could fill the whole paper with similar kind and appreciative words that come to us every day, but we forbear.

We quote them simply to show the trend of feeling toward the SENTINEL and its work, and particularly the special offer we are now making.

We trust our friends everywhere will do what they can to secure many subscribers under this offer, for it is our experience that these short-time subscribers invariably become regular readers of the paper, and thus ardent advocates of civil and religious liberty.

Remember that the offer remains open only until September 1st. Now is the time to take advantage of it and do missionary work in a worthy cause.
