Popular Preacher.—It makes no difference which day you observe as the Sabbath, so that you observe one day in seven. The fourth commandment does not specify the seventh day of the week.

Sunday Law.—Allow me to make one correction. It makes no difference what day, provided that day be "the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday."

Popular Preacher.—Oh—why—yes; of course; that is what I meant. You know I am always one of your staunch supporters.
