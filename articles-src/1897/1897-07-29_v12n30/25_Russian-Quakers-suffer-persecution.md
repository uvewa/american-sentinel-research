Reports from Russia state that Russian Quakers are being made to feel the heavy hand of the government because of their refusal to engage in military service. "All accounts show," says a London journal, "that they are a temperate and industrious people. But they refuse to bear arms or to put themselves in training for killing their fellowmen whenever statesmen fall out and give the word. This is unpardonable in the eyes of military governments. But if the authorities really knew it, these people, and all conscientious Protestants who suffer in Russia, are the best friends the government has."
