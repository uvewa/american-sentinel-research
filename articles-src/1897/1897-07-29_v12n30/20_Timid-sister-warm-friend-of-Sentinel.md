An evidently timid sister—but a warm friend of the SENTINEL—writes:

"I like the SENTINEL. It's the best paper of its kind I know of. I would like to get some to take advantage of your special offer on it but I don't know who would like to subscribe."

To all who find themselves in this situation, we would kindly suggest that they follow Job's example: "The cause which I knew not I searched out."
