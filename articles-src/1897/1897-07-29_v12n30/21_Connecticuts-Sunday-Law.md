According to reports sent us from some Connecticut journals, the new Sunday law in that State will not in most places be rigidly enforced. In Meriden, it is said, the law will remain practically a dead letter, owing to the difficulty of determining what are works of "mercy or necessity." This is certainly a just view of the statute. Even were it no infringement of religious freedom, it would still be void on the ground of indefiniteness. It does not undertake to specify what acts are to be classed as works of "mercy or necessity," and the individual is left without authority on the subject other than his own best judgment; which under such circumstances no person ought to be punished for using.
