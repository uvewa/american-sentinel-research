# The "Civil Sabbath" in Brazil.

In Brazil, according to the testimony of Protestant missionaries, the people of the larger cities and towns keep what Sunday-law agitators in America have termed a "civil sabbath,"—that is, a day of rest in each week, for the purpose of mere rest, and not for worship. On the question of its practical effect and utility in promoting the general welfare, Rev. D. G. Armstrong writes the following in the *Missionary Review of the World*:—

"No Sabbath! True, in many of the large cities, like Rio and São Paulo, all the chief stores are closed and many of the wheels of business are stopped on Sunday; but this is not due to any religious motive or any recognition of man's moral obligation to keep the sabbath. It is due only to the force of circumstances. The clerks and operatives combined and demanded of their employers one day in seven for rest and recreation, and the employers were forced to yield. But instead of spending their forced leisure in the refreshment of mind and body, both employers and employed while away the day in dissipation and pleasure, attending the theatre and racecourse, and perhaps walking through the streets in some idolatrous procession headed by Romish priests, thus ending the day more jaded than if it had been spent in the routine of business, and ill prepared for the week's labor."

Mr. Armstrong says, as will be observed, that this is no Sabbath at all. And certainly there is no Sabbath rest in such a rest day. The Sabbath rest is inseparable from religion. The advocates of Sunday laws, of whom the leaders are always clergymen, will not be satisfied with such a day of rest as is described in Mr. Armstrong's letter from Brazil. What they want is a Sunday law that will fill the churches. But there is only one way to enjoy the true Sabbath rest, and that is by that keeping of the Sabbath which is the result of faith in Jesus Christ.
