The Rev. John Lee, chairman of the Committee on Religious Liberty for Protestants in South America, is still endeavoring to get the papacy to grant religious liberty to Protestants in the Catholic countries of that continent. Having failed to accomplish anything by appeals to the pope and Cardinal Gibbons, he has finally addressed a letter to President McKinley, to which he has received through the State department the following reply:

"On October 26th last our Minister at Lima reported that the Peruvian bill concerning the registration of the marriages of foreigners failed for lack of agreement between the two houses. The Senate passed a bill satisfactory to the foreign element, and the House of Deputies amended it by providing for civil marriage. The session came to an end before an agreement could be reached.

"On March 31st last the department advised our Legation at Lima of its hopes that Peru would adopt a marriage law more consonant with the general practice of modern nations, and expressed its concern lest the civil rights of American citizens in that quarter might be impaired through the deficiency of existing law. It was further stated that this Government would be glad to learn that the subject would be revived at the next session of the Congress and satisfactorily disposed of."

It is in respect to the marriage laws of Peru and some other South American countries that the disabilities imposed upon Protestants are most conspicuous. The papacy disclaimed all responsibility in the matter, on the ground that the restrictions placed upon Protestants were in the nature of civil regulations, and a letter received from the "Cardinal Secretary of State" through Cardinal Gibbons, stated that "the Protestants in Peru, far from being restricted in the free exercise of their worship, are rather accorded a larger degree of toleration than is compatible with a strict construction of the political constitution of these countries." Now, as ever in past times, religious intolerance seeks refuge behind the "law of the land."

The appeal to the United States Government was made on the strength of the following testimony touching the situation in Peru, in a letter from Dr. Thomas B. Wood, a Protestant missionary:

"Since the coming of Mgr. Macchi, the apostolic delegate, to Peru, we have been falling under a series of new restrictions beginning in December, 1893, with a local decision excluding our marriages from civil registry in Callao, and ending in November, 1895, with a supreme executive decree outlawing them sweepingly, and declaring that their previous recognition had been contrary to the constitution, without stating in what respect. The decision of 1893 specifically named the Methodist Episcopal Church as having its marriages excluded from civil registry, with no need of such specific mention, as the decision was made to cover all marriages not solemnized by a Roman Catholic priest.

"After I had started our work in Lima and transferred it from the place of its beginning to larger and more central quarters, the archbishop wrote officially to the executive, asking that my operations be stopped. His ground was not a charge that I was violating any law, but the sweeping pretension that my propaganda was from the nature of it hostile to the State religion, and, therefore, hostile to the State."

And this charge of hostility to the State is the very one which Protestants in the United States are trying to establish against their fellow Protestants who oppose the disabilities sought to be put upon them by Sunday laws. The papacy is familiar with all these makeshifts. If Protestants would not refuse to see, they would know that in this they are following in the track of the church of Rome.
