The Bible says that to suffer oppression with the people of God is better than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. This was said of Moses, who chose rather to be persecuted for Christ's sake than to sit on the throne of the Pharoahs. It was faith that gave Moses the wisdom to make that choice; and events have amply demonstrated the value of that faith. To-day, as we know from the testimony of God's Word, Moses lives in the midst of the bliss and glory of heaven. But where would he have been if he had chosen the throne of Egypt? The question is answered by this incident which occurred not long ago, related in a London journal:

"Brugsch Bey, the famous explorer of the tombs of ancient Egypt, who discovered the mummy believed to be that of the Pharoah who oppressed the Israelites, recently found another mummy, on the coffin of which was the royal cartouche, indicating that the body was that of one of the Pharoahs. He was delighted with his discovery, and with great care packed it up for conveyance to Cairo. On arriving at the railway station, he was directed to have his 'luggage' put in the luggage-van. The Bey was concerned about its safety and insisted on its going in the carriage with him. The officials consented on the condition that the fare was paid as for a living passenger. Brugsch Bey accordingly paid Pharoah's fare, and the mummy went in the passenger coach. At the custom house of Cairo a new difficulty arose. The custom officers demanded duty. The Bey explained that the package was the mummy of Pharoah, and that no duty could be levied upon it. But the officers were convinced that it might be made dutiable under some category, and they searched their list for a suitable class. Finally, they decided to charge for it as dried fish, on which a duty is imposed. The Bey scorned to contend about the small charge involved, and the mummy having been weighed and the duty paid, the dead body of Pharoah entered the capital of Egypt as a package of dried fish. With such contempt did they treat the body of a potentate, who, in his lifetime, doubtless received the homage of all who came into his presence. In his case with startling force were the words of the prophet fulfilled that the terrible ones shall be despised and shall become as chaff. Isa. 24:5."
