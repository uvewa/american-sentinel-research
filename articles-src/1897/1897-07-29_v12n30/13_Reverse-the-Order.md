At the opening of the great Christian Endeavor convention in San Francisco, the vast audience, in response to successive strokes of the chairman's hammer, responded with the words,—

"The world for Christ;"
"The nation for Christ;"
"Myself for Christ."

The arrangement of these phrases may have been only an accident, but this order of conquest is the one adopted by very many who start out to be reformers, with the result that no reform is accomplished. "Myself for Christ" belongs first in all true Christian endeavor, and then if we take care that we ourselves continue to be "for Christ," God will take care of the result in the nation and in the world.
