This meeting was appointed for September 28, sessions being held in the morning, afternoon, and evening. Only about thirty-five persons were in attendance—a smaller number, it was said, than would have been present but for the fact that several other conventions were in session in the city.

Prof. Payton was elected chairman; and, as announced, Rev. J. Knox Montgomery, of Cincinnati, spoke first on the subject of "The Proper Relation of Civil Law to the Sabbath."

The speaker said that church people were largely responsible for the desecration of the Sabbath—that at one time a lady was worrying because her son only attended church once on Sunday and then enjoyed himself the rest of the day, and spoke of it to the minister, who replied that if he went to church in the morning she ought to congratulate herself and not worry. The speaker said that a man who would apply the same reasoning as used by this minister to the law in regard to stealing, killing, etc., would be regarded as a fool.

Those who are in authority, whose business it is to execute the laws, disregard the day. If these people—mayors, city officials, etc., who are now in the city and considering the best lighting of cities, telegraphic service, etc., would think more of the Sabbath than of electric lights there would be far less need of the best telegraphic system to get police service to all places and quarters of these cities day after day, and especially Sabbath afternoon.

Governments are to protect their citizens in their lives and rights and properties and to enact laws to this end; and if it be true that the Sabbath is a God-given heritage to man, and it be also true, as said, that one seventh of the laborers of this country are robbed of this right by toil and traffic, and 150,000 in the mail service, then we discover that the government itself is violating the law that has been enacted by God and reenacted by Congress and by the legislatures of the various States. Then, certainly, our government needs reformation along this line.

The national Constitution declares that Congress shall not enact any law regarding an establishment of religion or any law that will interfere with the rights of man in the worship of his God; and yet, said the speaker, "it seems to me that when the United States Government declares that the mails shall be carried all over this country on the Sabbath and that all the post-offices shall be open where the people demand it, this certainly interferes with the right of any Christian man, at least, who may be in the employ of the government, to worship God according to his own desire.

"Of course, it is maintained that if a man's conscientious convictions will not allow him to engage in this sort of occupation on the Sabbath, he is at liberty to resign; and yet it does not seem to me that that is right.

"Along with the Sunday mail traffic is the Sunday train and Sunday saloon and newspaper. The Sabbath is imperiled all along these lines; and if it be true that morality and religion lie at the basis of all good government, and if it be true that the Sabbath lies at the foundation of true morality and religion, then I declare it to be true that the Sabbath being imperiled, the government itself is imperiled. Certainly every government has a right to enact laws that look toward the morals of the people. Then the government should enact such laws.

"It seems to me that the proper relation of civil law to the Sabbath is that of protection—not as a religious institution, but as a civil institution. Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion—certainly not. None of us advocate anything of the sort; but if it is so that the profanation of the Sabbath is a demoralization of the people, then the government should have at heart the elevation of the morals of the people and should enact and enforce laws that look after the protection of this rest day and its preservation as a God-given right to every man.

"The idea, of course, is often set forth that we are endeavoring to make people go to church by law, and have no right to legislate regarding the Sabbath—because all Sabbath legislation is in the interest of Christianity. Well, certainly it is; and yet the fact is that all Sabbath legislation is in the interests of the State, because it is in the interests of the morals and intelligence of the citizen in the State. Civil law should protect this institution.

"We are told in the Word of God regarding other nations and the result of their profanation of the Sabbath. The overthrow of the Christian Sabbath or American Sabbath, with its sacred associations, would be more disastrous to our nation than the overthrow of all our public libraries and civic monuments; and I wish to say that the observance of the Sabbath lies deep in the everlasting necessities of human nature, and that as long as man is man, the blessedness of keeping it, not as a day of rest only, but as a day of spiritual rest, will never be annulled."

The next speaker was W. J. Coleman, of Allegheny, Pa., who said in substance: Mr. Chairman: The association that meets here to-day has for its fundamental principle the doctrine that the Lord Jesus Christ is ruler of nations. That is the foundation stone which this association seeks to lay at the very basis of all our political legislation.

We have the question. How far should civil laws go in protecting the Sabbath? Now, I believe they should go to the extent of forbidding all servile labor on that day. I would not put a Seventh-day Adventist in jail for working inside his own house or plowing in a field, but if he made a public exhibition of it or tried to insult the moral sense of the community, I think he needs a lesson: but if he works quietly, out of sight as far as possible, not interfering with anybody, provided he keeps another day of the week, I do not think I would interfere with him.

But I think we ought to stop all these things on the ground of servile labor. For instance, we have 10,000—some people say millions—of unemployed men in this country. Every man that works on Sunday keeps another man out of work just that much. Another thing: no man can stand alone and ask for the observance of the Sabbath on his own account. If he does stand for it, he is discharged.

Speeches of ten minutes' length were given by a number of persons along the same lines. After these talks a new organization was formed, known as the Ohio State Reform Association, with constitution modeled after that of the national organization.

The following resolutions were adopted:—

"Resolved, That there is much in our political life to arouse the deep concern of the Christian patriot. Evil influences are multiplying and growing more aggressive. Corruption abounds, good laws fail to be enforced; capital and labor are in conflict, and other evils threaten the very life of the nation.

"The remedy for these evils is found only in the laws of Jesus Christ. The principles that should guide man here, as everywhere else, are justice and love. The application of the principles will solve all the troublesome questions that are seeking settlement.

"To secure the desired end, there ought to be inscribed on the front of our fundamental law the aim and purpose of civil society to establish government on the foundation of Christian morality. A radical mistake was made in excluding from the national constitution all reference to God and his law. We must retrace our steps.

"The transfer of the legislation and administration of the government so largely into the hands of professional politicians, who pursue their selfish ends; the failure to make government a 'terror to evil doers and a praise to them that do well,' are the result of excluding fear of God and loyalty to Christ from political life. Christian men must bring their influences to bear in the sphere of civil society. Education in the use of the Word of God in our schools must train Christian patriots for their solemn civil duties."

The officers elected were: For president, Rev. J. C. Smith, of Cincinnati; corresponding secretary, J. K. Montgomery, of Cincinnati; recording secretary, Rev. D. McKinney; treasurer, W. R. Sterrett. The office of vice-president was filled by nineteen names.

The convention adjourned to meet at the call of the president.
