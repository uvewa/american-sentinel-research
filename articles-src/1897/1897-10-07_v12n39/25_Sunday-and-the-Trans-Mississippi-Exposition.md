The Ministerial Union of Omaha, Neb., are determined if possible to prevent Sunday opening of the gates of the Trans-Mississippi exposition, soon to be held in that city. Immediately upon reassembling after their vacation, they met in Koutze church, Omaha, to the number of twenty-three, and took the following steps to prevent people who cannot take summer vacations from enjoying the exposition sights on the one day of the week when they can be away from their work:—

"First—That this union petitions the board of directors of the Trans-Mississippi exposition to close the gates of the exposition on the Lord's day, as was done at the recent exposition at Atlanta and at Nashville.

"Second—We recommend that the union take action calling the attention of the various ecclesiastical bodies and other religious conventions of the States and Territories interested in the Trans-Mississippi exposition, to the matter of closing the gates of the exposition, and requesting them to petition the board of directors of the exposition to close on that day.

"That the secretary of our union communicate this petition to the board of directors of the exposition."
