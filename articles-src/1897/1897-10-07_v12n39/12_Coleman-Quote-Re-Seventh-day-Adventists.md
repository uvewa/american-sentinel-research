"I would not put a Seventh-day Adventist in jail for working inside his own house or plowing in a field; but if he made a public exhibition of it or tried to insult the moral sense of the community, I think he needs a lesson."—From Speech by W. J. Coleman, at Columbus (Ohio) National Reform Convention. See page 613.
