THE following item appeared in the *Chattanooga* (Tenn.) Times, of Sept. 9:—

"HUNTSVILLE, ALA., Sept. 6.—Charles Cross, a white mail carrier for the city, was suspended to-day for thirty days pending his trial for insubordination. Cross is a Seventh-day Adventist and observes Saturday for his Sabbath. It so happened that all the substitutes were either on duty or away on leave of absence last Saturday when Cross was ordered to report for duty, which he positively declined to do, hence his suspension."

In a letter to a friend Mr. Cross states that when his case came before the postmaster-general, the latter ordered him to be reinstated, which was accordingly done. The reply from the department at Washington to the Huntsville postmaster stated that the government respected the religious conscience of its employés.
