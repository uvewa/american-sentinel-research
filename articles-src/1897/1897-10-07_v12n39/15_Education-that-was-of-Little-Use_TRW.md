"Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and deeds." Acts 7:22.

What small value attaches to worldly education when an individual is fitting for a place in the Lord's work. No doubt Moses thought himself fully competent to take command of the Israelitish forces, to organize them into an army, to march at their head, fighting their way successfully from Egypt and bondage to Canaan and freedom; and when they should have arrived at Canaan, no doubt he imagined that he would be thoroughly able to frame all such laws and regulations as would be best for the government of such a nation as Israel.

Moses had been a successful leader under the Egyptian government. Josephus says that Moses had conducted Egyptian armies through successful campaigns against the foes of Egypt.

He was a statesman too as well as a general; he had not lived till he was forty years old at the court of the Egyptian king without becoming skilled in statecraft, the managing of affairs. He was intended eventually to occupy the throne when the reigning Pharaoh should die, and Egypt was then the very greatest nation in the world.

Surely Moses had all in the way of education and scholarship that the wisdom of this world could give him. And how much of it all did he use? What was it all worth? When God selected Moses to lead, he sent him into the wilderness to keep sheep for forty years. Not so much as a spoonful of the Egyptian lore he had been forty years in acquiring was of any use to him. He must learn to take care of people, of children, of slaves, just freed from degrading bondage, and they needed simply a wise and patient shepherd.

Egyptian statesmanship was entirely at a discount; it was not considered of any value at all.

When laws were to be made for Israel, such laws were given them as were adapted to the use of people who served the one true God.

The customs of a nation of innumerable idols, the laws of a people who rolled and wallowed in disgusting and lascivious idol worship, could be of no service to Israel. God himself directed Moses in making the laws. None other than inspired law-making, was of any use whatever, as none but God-given laws are fit to govern any nation, and no one but God understands politics, "the science of government."

And Moses' generalship? Well, when Israel first confronted foes in battle Joshua was sent out as general and Moses' business was simply to pray.

And so it was through all the wilderness journey; and that is about the way that God values purely worldly education now as a fitting out for his service.
