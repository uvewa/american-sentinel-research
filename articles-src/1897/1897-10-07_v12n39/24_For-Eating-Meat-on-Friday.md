In these days we are prepared for the announcement of almost anything in the line of a usurpation of religious authority by the civil power, but our expectations are quite exceeded by the following press dispatch, taken from the St. Louis (Mo.) Chronicle:—

"Troy, N. Y., Sept. 25.—Police Magistrate Donohue considerably surprised the loungers about the police court yesterday morning when he sent John Burns, a Catholic, to jail, for attempting to eat meat on Friday.

"Early that morning Burns went into a restaurant on Ferry Street and ordered beefsteak. Burns got into an altercation with a colored waiter, named Johnson, and both were arrested.

"'Burns,' said the magistrate sharply, 'what church do you go to?'

"'This ain't the place to talk religion,' replied Burns.

"'Never mind about that. What church do you go to?'

"'Well, I go to St. Francis.'

"'Thought so, Burns; I'll send you to jail for eating meat on Friday. Johnson, you are discharged.'

"Burns will have to stay in the county jail until next Tuesday, because he attempted to eat meat on Friday."

After all, a law to compel a person to abstain from meat on Friday would be no more religious than is a law to compel him to abstain from work on Sunday.
