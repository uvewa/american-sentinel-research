On the last Sunday in August the village of Quogue, L. I., was the scene of one of the many cases in which personal spite uses the Sunday laws in a way which disgraces both law and justice. A private citizen, Edwards, and a game constable, Jackson, arrested three men and a boy for shooting snipe, in the early morning, on a sand beach "across Shinnecock Bay." No magistrate could be found to try the case until a late hour. The outcome of the day's work is told by the Evening Sun (New York), in these words:—

"Hungry, tired, and angry, the party drove into Southampton at 5:30 o'clock in the evening. For nine long hours they had been carried about the country and represented to every passer-by as felons of the worst stamp. Squire Howell, of Southampton, before whom they were taken, was asked to entertain a charge of violating the game law against them.

"'What were they shooting?' he asked.

"'Snipe,' Edwards replied.

"'There's no law now against shooting snipe,' replied the court.

"Edwards received the news like a death blow. Had all his trouble, all his show, been for nothing? But he bethought himself of the law against shooting on Sunday, and lodged that complaint. The squire entertained it and held the prisoners in $25 bail each for examination on Saturday."

Such occurrences as this destroy respect for law, and prejudice the public mind against the church and Christianity as few other things could do.

Similar follies frequently appear wherever efforts are made to "promote the moral and religious interests of the community" by enforcing Sunday laws. Under the new law in Connecticut, the Providence Bulletin reports the arrest of a man "for buying a pound of crackers on Sunday," though to the average mind this does not seem to have been a very grave offense. The idea of exempting "works of necessity and mercy" in the ordinary Sunday law is another point in which that which was at first a purely religious provision is made to serve all sorts of purposes, or none at all, according to the notions of magistrates. Of this provision in the Connecticut law the Bulletin referred to above says:—

"Who is to decide what constitutes a work of mercy? It would be a mercy for some men to let a skilful barber shave them on Sunday, but the Connecticut authorities are pretty generally agreed that the barber shops must be closed at twelve midnight on Saturday, and so the more hirsute citizen, for whom a Saturday-night shave is not sufficient, is compelled to hack himself in his crude endeavors to get the beard off his face on Sunday morning. Who can say how much more profanity there has been on the first day of the week in Connecticut since this law went into effect than there was before?"
