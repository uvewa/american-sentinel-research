It is not the will of God that any of his creatures, men or angels, should wear any yoke save that of Jesus Christ.

All yoke making has been committed to the tender, loving hands of Jesus, the Creator, who, knowing just the ability, disposition, and strength of each one, is able to adjust a yoke to each, of which he can truthfully say, "My yoke is easy, and my burden is light," and which every wearer of this yoke will find by experience is delightfully true.

God never designed that any of his creatures should be pressed under grievous yokes. But doubt of the goodness of God, and distrust of his love, have led men and angels to devise ways of their own, which have brought upon themselves and others heavy burdens, grievous to be borne.

Jealousy, envy, hatred, and malice, are the cruel attributes that enter into the making of heavy yokes. Has Satan ever deceived you into making yokes for others? Have you arranged good and proper confessions for others to make before you would take them into your fellowship? Have you worked out a course of humility needful for someone's discipline, and done all you could to lead them to see the wisdom of your plans? Has it ever worked? Have you not thus brought distress upon yourself, and only found relief by obeying the injunction of God, "that ye break every yoke," and that "thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke"? Isa. 58: 6-9.

Jesus came into the world to break yokes that were killing the wearers, to undo heavy burdens that were bending to the earth the bearers. And as his Spirit enters our hearts he will set us about his work of breaking yokes.

And, oh, how much more enjoyable is the experience of breaking yokes than that of making them! How our hearts rejoice as we see the oppressed go free, as we listen to their songs of rejoicing for deliverance, as we see in the tearful eye the opening of the tender heart to the love of God, and his peace and rest enter the heart!
