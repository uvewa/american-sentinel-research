A DISPATCH from Rome says that "the pope has instructed the papal nuncio at Madrid to insist upon the clergy opposing Carlism and to urge the clergy to earnestly support the Spanish ministry and present Spanish dynasty." And the pope and clergy of "the church" never have anything to do with politics, no never—well hardly ever, unless the interest of "the church" or something else demands it, and their own inclination justifies it.
