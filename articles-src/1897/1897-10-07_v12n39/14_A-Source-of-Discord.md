THE Hobart (Tasmania) Mercury, of July 29, makes the following very sensible observations on the question of introducing religious matters into State affairs:—

"The introduction of the name of the Deity into the discussions on the Commonwealth Bill can only be regarded as most unfortunate. Parliament has always recognized that there are certain subjects which it is better to settle in private than to thrash out on the floor of the House, and amongst these might surely have been classed the one in which the feelings and prejudices of members as a body are most involved, the subject, too, which, despite its sacredness, is bound to give rise to most acrid and heated discussion, simply because those who have any interest at all in it are bound to feel very deeply about it, and to express those feelings, too, when they come into collision with those opposed to them. That this will be the case is shown by the counter petitions which those in favor of recognition of the divine name have called forth, the wording of which is at least as dignified and logical, if not as reverential, as those it replies to, and the indication, therefore, is that those who desire the constitution amended in the way the Adelaide Convention declined to do it should refrain from pressing their views, at any rate in public debate, which will be irritating inside the House, and certainly not altogether edifying to those who read the speeches. Members have quite enough ground for discord without adding the religious one, and a debate of the kind that might surround the attempt to change the preamble of the Federation Bill would probably create enmity that would last the rest of the session, if not a lifetime."
