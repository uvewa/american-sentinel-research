It is remarkable how "the press" can see in the speeches of the rulers of Europe "flings," insinuations, "taunts," and all such disrespectful things toward each other, whereas in fact there is nothing of the kind. Remarks which are perfectly proper in themselves, from such sources, are instantly caught up and filled with sinister meanings, and in flaming headlines are so proclaimed to the world. It seems evident that the press is "spoiling for a fight"—provided always that other people will do the fighting.
