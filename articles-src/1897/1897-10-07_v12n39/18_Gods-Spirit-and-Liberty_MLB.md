"The spirit of the Lord God is upon me." Why? "Because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me"—what for?—"to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound." Isa. 61:1.

The Spirit of God never closes a prison door on any one. No; but it has opened the prison doors just as the prophet foretold.

"But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said, Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life." Acts 5:19, 20. "Behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison; and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands." Acts 12:7.

What spirit is it that is at work to-day to close the prison doors on God's people? Is it not the same that shut Peter in?

The prisons were never built for God's people, and no power on earth can with safety to itself put his people into them. No man can rightfully judge another man in regard to duty toward God.

Christ tells us in plain words what will judge us in the last day. He says, "The word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him," and also, "For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak."

This statement of Christ's is in perfect harmony with Moses' prophecy of Christ in Deuteronomy 18:18: "I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him." Jesus declared that the words he spoke were not his.

So when he speaks of the Sabbath, it is the Father speaking through him. The Father, then, sent Christ to tell this world who is Lord of the Sabbath, who made it, for what purpose it was made, and what was lawful for man to do on it. He also sent Christ to leave an example of the right use of the Sabbath.

But there is a spirit in the land to-day, a spirit that will shut the prison doors on God's people who follow Christ's example in Sabbath-keeping, as it did in the days of Peter. This spirit enters the same class as it did in those days,—the professed people of God.

But how easy to detect what spirit it is at work! Just as soon as you see any one calling for the aid of the civil power to enforce what they think is the law of God, you may be sure that the spirit is not of God.
