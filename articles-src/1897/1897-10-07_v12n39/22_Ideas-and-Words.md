Last week I was dealing with ideas and their transcendant importance. Ideas can be expressed only in words; and so words are things of great consequence, and ought to be picked and chosen with the utmost care in every discussion. Much idle and profitless debate would frequently be spared, and much time saved for matters of real moment, if people would always, before they begin a controversy, settle what it is that they mean to talk about.

* * *

For instance, here is the venerable David Agnew, ex-chief justice of Pennsylvania, delivering an address, in which he uses the following language: "I have shown (conclusively, I think) that this is a Christian nation; that this continent and the provinces were settled by a Christian people"—and more to the same effect.

* * *

What distinction was in the mind of this distinguished octogenarian between "this continent" and "the provinces," it is not easy to divine. But it is clear that he regards the proposition that "this is a Christian nation" as synonymous with the statement that "this continent and the provinces were settled by a Christian people." But strict attention to definitions will show that there is no necessary connection between the two, and that, while the latter is a correct statement of a historical fact, the former is a fallacious abstraction.

* * *

What is the meaning of the word "nation" when used in its present connection? It is simply another name for "the State." The latter is the preferable term, because "nation" is a word of several different significations or senses, and is often the equivalent of "country" or "people," whereas "State" has in jurisprudence a fixed, definite, and peculiar meaning of its own. It is true that the "country" known as the United States was largely colonized by "people" who professed—whatever their practice—a variety of religions which they called "Christian," and that the majority of those who at present inhabit that geographical area are considered to be Christians. But these facts afford no justification whatever of the position that ours is a Christian State.

* * *

In fact, it is manifestly impossible that a State should be Christian. What is a State? A State is simply a big corporation, like a railroad or a manufacturing company. As I have previously observed, those who administer the affairs of the big corporation make up the personnel of the government, and all citizens are stockholders. Now it would be clearly absurd to talk of a railroad company as being "Christian" because its individual officers and members, or most of them, were connected with Christian churches. But, with all due deference to high authority, it is no less absurd so to talk of a State or nation.

* * *

The State is the work of men's hands. She is of the earth, earthy. She has no soul to be damned or to be saved. She knows neither Deity nor devil. She does not know her citizens as Christians, nor as Hebrews, nor as Mohammedans, nor as Mormons, nor pagans, nor Buddhists. She deals with them as men and women alone. She has no means of ascertaining their inward thoughts or beliefs, no power in any wise to affect them, no right whatever to meddle with them. It is only their outward conduct or behaviour that comes within her cognizance, and it is by temporal penalties alone that she can regulate this.

* * *

And what is Christianity?—An inward life, based on the faith that there is another world than this, which individual men may reach, though no "State" can ever get there. Christian men and women we have, fortunately enough, all around us. They are those who submit their souls to the "imperious dominion" claimed by the Master whose kingdom is "within,"—that domain of the soul which is closed as absolutely against the State as heaven itself.

* * *

The learned judge goes on to say that our States "set the legal evidence of their belief in their early constitutions." But how is it possible that a State should have a religious belief, and set it anywhere? The State never made a constitution any more than a railroad corporation makes a charter. And States had no existence till the instruments of their birth—their respective constitutions—were made by the people who inhabited the various tracts of land that had been colonies of England. It is perfectly true, and perfectly lamentable, that the conception of religious equality was unknown to these men, and that all their works were more or less tainted with the blasphemous union of Church and State. But the church is one thing and religion is another; and to embody religious dogmas, as they did, in constitutions and statutes, is not to accomplish the impossible feat of making a State religious. Though I admit none but Christians to employment on my railroad, I impart no religious element to the transportation of passengers and goods over the line.

* * *

What our forefathers did, in erecting their States, was to unite their churches to the new corporations in certain matters of detail, by extending the protection of the civil arm to the requirements of dogmas that were particularly dear to them, and by attaching certain disabilities to the profession of other religions than the Christian, as they considered it to be. Thus far they were false to the true American theory of government and to the Master's teaching of religion. But, again, they did not, because they *could* not, thus make their States religious.

* * *

CHIEF-JUSTICE AGNEW'S proposition, then, that "this is a Christian nation," may be translated in two ways. It may mean that "this is a Christian State." Thus rendered, it involves, as we have seen, a contradiction in terms. Or it may mean that the majority of the inhabitants of the United States are professedly Christians. In this sense, it is true enough, but it is merely a historical truth, a statistical truth, a social truth. It is not a truth of jurisprudence, it has not the slightest relevancy to any matter of legislative enactment or public administration. It is as much in place, and no more, where such things are concerned, as the statement that the Mississippi River is higher at its mouth than at its source, or that the force of gravitation varies inversely as the square of the distance between a body and the center of the earth, or that most people in New Orleans have dark hair.

* * *

LET us illustrate. Ex-Justice Agnew comes of a distinguished Pennsylvania family. He bears a name worthily immortalized by Dr. D. Hayes Agnew, through marvelous achievements in medicine and surgery. He was himself an honor to his name and his State while on the bench. Could he have been this, if he had been influenced in the slightest in the administration of that branch of Pennsylvania's government with which he was connected by this maxim of his that ours is a Christian nation? Because the first settlers of America were Christians, would he sentence a Christian to jail for a month, and a Hebrew to jail for a year when the two had committed precisely the same offense against the law of the land, which he swore to administer without partiality or favor? For a like reason would he break his official oath so far as to be biased between two litigants in a civil case brought before him, by reason of the fact that one of the parties thereto avowed his allegiance to Mahomet, while the other had been baptized a Presbyterian?—Of course not.

* * *

AND yet, it is equally a breach of duty in a judge who is called upon to decide the constitutionality of an American statute, to give any consideration to the statistical fact that a majority of the people who made the constitution were Christians as it is for him to mete out one "justice" to the Christian and another to the pagan in a particular case. A Christian people, like other peoples, may totally separate Church and State, or may unite them to such extent as seems desirable. But if we declare that a total separation of Church and State is necessary, by our fundamental law, then any attempt of a legislature or a court to unite the two becomes a usurpation; and it is perfectly immaterial whether the church selected for the combination happens to be that of the majority or that of the minority, past or present.

* * *

JUDGE AGNEW further declares that other religions than the Christian have only been "tolerated" here. If this be true, the union of Church and State is complete in this "free" land of ours. No man is free who is "tolerated" by others. As well talk of "tolerating" a Jew or an agnostic in the liberty of labor and locomotion or the possession of property, as to talk of tolerating his belief or his lack thereof in the matter of religion. As well may a Republican talk of tolerating the dissemination of Democratic doctrines, or *vice versa*, as one religionist to talk of tolerating the faith of another. The absolute equality of all religions and of no religion before the law is the true American principle. Upon the good road to this glorious consummation the founders of this republic made some feeble, halting, tentative steps. They were checked by the *zeitgeist*, that perpetual impediment to truth and progress. They left to us, their children, the heritage of their well meaning, and ours is the brighter and better light that guides directly to the goal. If we are satisfied to leave their work where they stopped, we are false to them, and to the high and holy trust which they left us. It is ours to "reform it altogether;" ours to dig up the roots of the evil over which they strained with slipping fingers; ours to repudiate the slavery of words, and to deal with things as they *are*, and not as they are *called*; ours to strip off the last rags of mediavalism from the fair form of Republican America, and let her beauty shine undimmed before the world.
