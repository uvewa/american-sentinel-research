IN 1810 the Argentine Republic gained her independence, and believing that a religion ought not to be enforced by torture, they publicly burned in the principal plaza the king of Spain's decree authorizing the Inquisition and the burning of "heretics." They also burned the instruments of torture used by that tribunal.

Although nominally Roman Catholics, they saw in it a cruel device which they as republicans proclaiming "liberty and equality" could not consistently agree to; and we believe that their humanity also prompted them to a desire to let freedom rejoice the hearts of their fellow men.

- They copied their constitution to a great extent from that of the United States, but did not put in practice the glorious principle stated in the Declaration of Independence, which leaves religion to be supported by those who wish and not a particular religion to be supported willingly or unwillingly by taxes gained by the toil of all religionists. Argentina pays annually a large sum for the support of the Roman Catholic Church.

There are no doubt conscientious men in her priesthood; but the corruptness of the lives of many of them causes many to mock at all religion and to be materialists; and also tends to encourage immorality and violence in all places. The man who has done most for Argentina is President Sarmiento, who having been consul to the United States, procured a staff of North American teachers, who introduced the normal school system there, thus conferring a great blessing on the rising generation, not the least of which was that they were enabled to read the Word of Life for themselves.

He also encouraged immigration and railroads, thus getting enlightenment from a land proclaiming separation of Church and State, which principle has been the foundation of its greatness. Argentina is a beautiful land, possessing all climes and a productive soil; but in comparison with the great North American Republic, what is it?

Americans, freemen, do you value the principle of separation of Church and State for which your fathers the builders of this republic, died? Or do you want your nation to be like Argentina and the other so-called republics of Central and South America? "If the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed."
