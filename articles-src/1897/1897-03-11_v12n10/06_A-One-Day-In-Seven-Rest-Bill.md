A circular has been sent out in Massachusetts by a committee of Lowell citizens, asking cooperation in securing the passage of the following bill, which has been introduced into the State legislature, under the title, "An Act to better secure a rest-day for working people":

"SECTION 1. No county, town, city, municipal or other corporation, organized, located, or doing business in the Commonwealth, and no official, agent, or servant of corporation, or of the Commonwealth, shall directly or indirectly cause or allow any person to perform labor, either under contract or otherwise, for such corporation or the Commonwealth, more than six days in a week.

"SECTION 2. Any corporation or person violating the provisions of this Act shall be punished by a fine of not less than $50 nor more than $100 for each violation.

"SECTION 3. This act shall take effect July 1, 1897."

The movement to secure this legislation, it is stated, was inaugurated at a meeting of the General Association of Congregational churches of Massachusetts, held at Fall River last May. The circular states that "while this bill will not secure to them [workingmen] all we desire, looking at it as Christians from a religious standpoint, yet we are satisfied it is all that can be obtained by legislation at the present time."

This, of course, is a plain intimation that what "we desire, looking at it as Christians from a religious standpoint," is hoped for from legislation in the future. And what else is to be expected but that preachers and church people will look at the matter "from a religious standpoint," and will be moved in the matter by motives arising from religious belief?

Why has the movement for a legalized weekly rest day been inaugurated and controlled by the churches and religious societies, if the motives behind it are not of a religious character?

It will be noticed that this proposed bill does not specify any day of the week as the day of rest; but it is assumed in the circular that "if this bill becomes a law it will make it the interest of all incorporated companies in the State to reduce their Sunday labor to a minimum."

However this may be, or whatever the reason which makes this a one-day-in-seven bill instead of a direct Sunday bill, the fact remains that no legislation can be proper on the subject of a weekly day of rest. A weekly rest is a matter which the Creator himself took into consideration at the close of creation, and which is entirely covered by his own Sabbath law, the fourth commandment. That law applies to every individual of mankind; it is the best law for a weekly rest that could possibly be made, and is in full force at the present time. Hence there is neither occasion nor room for human legislation on the subject. By any attempt at this, man will only invade the prerogatives of God.
