The annual convention of the "Lancaster County Sabbath Association," was held February 4, at Lancaster, Pa. The session was devoted to a general discussion of topics relating to Sunday observance, and a number of resolutions on the subject were presented and passed in the usual manner.

The points embodied in the resolutions were that,—

1. The Sabbath is an institution of divine origin, of universal and perpetual obligation, declared both in nature and revelation; and has been transferred by divine authority from the seventh to the first day of the week.

2. Beyond all doubt the Lord's day is fast becoming secularized in the entire country.

3. The Republic can be perpetuated only upon the eternal principles of the gospel, and by heeding the command to keep holy the Sabbath day.

4. The Sabbath was given for spiritual development as well as bodily rest, and the Sunday newspaper does not conduce to spiritual development and should therefore be shunned.

5. There should be no Sunday traffic and excursions to deprive workingmen of Sunday rest.

6. The Mayor of Lancaster ought to issue a proclamation stopping all Sunday business and the crying of Sunday newspapers, and municipal legislation should be had in the matter, if necessary.

7. The excuse of closed church doors in the summer months should be removed from those who are not disposed to Sunday observance.

8. Christians should not maintain Sunday excursion trains and other Sunday traffic at camp-meetings and other outdoor services.

9. The citizens of Lancaster protest against any Sunday selling of liquor in hotels, and against any change in the Sunday law of the State, except the imposition of a heavier penalty for its violation.

The discussion of these resolutions developed that variety of opinion respecting the nature and obligation of the Sabbath which is the necessary result of the lack of Scripture and logic behind the first-day institution. The Sabbath being an institution of divine origin and of universal and perpetual obligation, could not possibly have experienced a transfer from the seventh to the first day of the week. It stands in the very bosom of the immutable precepts of the Decalogue. Its very basis is the resting of God upon a particular day, and His blessing of the same. The assumption that it can be changed from that particular day to another day which God neither rested upon nor blessed, and which therefore affords no basis for the Sabbath, is a starting point from which men's minds can progress only further and further from the truth, and arrive only at the most divergent conclusions.

A number of things were said by the different speakers which will not harmonize with the idea of enforced "sabbath" observance.

The president, Rev. Mr. Fry, said that the rock on which the Sabbath day stands is not political expediency nor physical necessity, but religious principle. But what would become of the movement for Sunday enforcement if the plea of political expediency and physical necessity could not be urged in its support?

Rev. Mr. Hayes said that the Sabbath calls men to worship, to commune with God. To try to enforce the Sabbath by law, therefore, is to attempt to force men to commune with God. He said also that the claim so frequently made that the Sabbath is a Jewish institution is absolutely untrue; and this he proved by conclusive evidence. But if the Sabbath is not now a Jewish institution, was it ever such? And if it was never such, what ground in logic or Scripture is there for the phrase "Jewish Sabbath"?

Mrs. Dr. Underwood said that Sabbath rest and Sabbath reverence were inseparable, and could not rightfully be divorced. This being true, as it is, any attempt to enforce Sabbath rest by law must be as improper as an attempt to enforce Sabbath reverence.

Rev. J. Y. Mitchell said: "We hear a great deal of talk at sabbath conventions about Sunday papers, trolley cars, etc., but if members of the Church are the elect of God (and I believe they are) we ought not to consider so much what is transpiring outside as within, and I argue that if every Christian should resolve that henceforth he would keep the Sabbath as it should be observed, it would have ten times as much influence as all the resolutions you can spread upon your minute books." It is at the "house of God" that Sabbath reform needs to begin; but the Church, instead of doing her duty in this respect, is calling for laws to inaugurate such a reform among the "heathen" outside her fold.

Rev. J. M. Titzel was the only speaker to oppose a Sunday law, and this he did in a vigorous address in which he said that the Church should stand for what is right, and that church members should observe the Lord's day because it is right. "Fall back upon the power of law," he said, "and you have nothing upon which to stand. I have no sympathy with the formulation of laws to inculcate morals in the people."

Would that all those who stand before the people as ambassadors for Christ might realize that the Sabbath stands in the power of God, supported by His own immutable law, not one jot or tittle of which can fail while heaven and earth continue. Then they would not be saying to the world, as they do in these "sabbath" conventions, that the Sabbath depends for its enforcement upon the fallible, mutable laws of finite man.
