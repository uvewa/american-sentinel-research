A New York daily refers to "Lent" as a season in which the "poor do penance for the rich," and in explanation of the statement, gives the following:—

"From data furnished by experts in trade the Journal gives careful estimates herewith of what the poor will lose and what the rich will gain by reason of all the "self-denial" that will gladden the consciences of the fashionable between now and Easter.

"New York spends $3,000,000 a year for flowers alone. Thorley, the florist, says so, and he ought to know.

"'The first three weeks of Lent are the dullest of the year,' he said yesterday. 'Later the trade picks up in anticipation of Easter, but just now it is very poor. In large establishments employés are not discharged, but the decrease of trade affects many who are even less able to stand the loss. The people who gather greens and do rough work, find themselves without employment, and to them Lent means a loss of between $400,000 and $500,000.'

"At Sherry's, Delmonico's, the Waldorf and other places of fashionable entertainment, the servants are never dismissed when there is nothing for them to do. Lent to them means only a little well-earned rest. To the marketmen, who suffer by less business at these establishments, however, it tells another story.

"The wholesale merchants from whom provisions for the big banquets are purchased buy less, and the raisers of poultry, fruits and vegetables find no buyers for their produce. The thousands of chickens which would be consumed in supreme de volaille for cotillion suppers, the partridges, grouse, terrapin, asparagus, lettuce, hothouse strawberries, etc., which would accompany them on the menus, will have no purchasers, and those dependant upon the sale of these for support will be obliged to suffer the greatest privation.

"To the dressmakers Lent brings sadness. To their assistants, in many cases, it means no work. The same is true of milliners.

"The musicians who furnish the music for society's dancing will have nothing to do until after Easter. Their idleness will lose them about $25,000.

"Another class of people who will suffer for society's season of penance will be household servants. Many small establishments will do without butlers and footmen, now that entertaining is ended for a while, and the housemaids will be required to do duty for them. A number of residences will be closed, all the servants dismissed, and the owners will go South to be fashionable and economic."

By the way, what authority is there in Scripture for this annual period of penance?
