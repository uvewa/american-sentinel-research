It may seem to many that there is nothing more than theory in the discussion carried on by the SENTINEL touching the Church-and-State tendencies which are seen to-day in the American Government. In their own minds at least such have no doubt queried whether these alleged dangers are likely to bear any tangible fruits. The answer to this query is given in the following figures taken from the biennial report of President Moon, of the International Religious Liberty Association, covering the period from March 4, 1895, to the present date:—

**IMPRISONMENTS OF SEVENTH-DAY OBSERVERS FOR REFUSAL TO KEEP SUNDAY.**

No account is made in this of the temporary confinement of the above and other defendants during the process of their respective trials.

The arrests by States and Territories for this period are as follows: Alabama, 1; Arkansas, 3; California, 1; Georgia, 1; Illinois, 9; Maryland, 10; Mississippi, 2; North Carolina, 2; Tennessee, 22; Texas, 1; Manitoba, 1; Ontario, 7. Total, 60.

This is the practical side—and intensely practical it is to the victims—of the movement to reestablish the Church-and-State features of colonial times, which the American Government was thought to have happily outgrown. Will you still believe, reader, that there is "nothing in it"?
