THE saloon-keeper by force of law is compelled to help pay the taxes on my church, in the use of which I denounce his infernal traffic. If the saloon-keeper is taxed to support my church, in all fairness he ought to have something to say in its management. "No taxation without representation."—Rev. Madison C. Peters.

FOR the same amount of money that New York City is to raise by taxation this year the people of Holland will drain the Zuyder Zee, build a vast moat of solid masonry thirty miles long and reclaim half a million acres of land that will support a population almost as great as ours.—New York World.

"So long as religion does not step out of its province it should not, in any of its forms, depend on the good pleasure of the State. It belongs to the civil power neither to authorize nor forbid it; for here the civil power clashes with a primordial right of the individual." —De Pressensé.

THE South Carolina House is reported to have passed a bill requiring a license for every business, profession, or calling, including that of ministers of the gospel.

BY a vote of 209 to 149, the British House of Commons decided, February 10, against the prohibition of liquor selling in public houses on Sundays.
