It would doubtless be generally conceded that in the process of arresting a man and haling him to the police station, there is nothing which savors of observance of the "sabbath." Yet some people are so anxious that everybody shall keep Sunday that they would furnish extra work for the police force on that day in arresting such as do not want to keep it. Like the man who was determined to have peace even if he had to fight for it, they are determined to have Sunday rest even if they have to make Sunday work to get it. Is it because policemen are supposed to have no souls or to be excused from the requirements of divine law, that they are thus shut out from "sabbath" observance in the interests of "sabbath" observance?
