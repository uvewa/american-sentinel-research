From an address by Dr. David Philipson at Mound Street Temple, Chicago, February 20.

WHEN, at the foundation of this Government, the constitutional provision, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," was adopted, it was undoubtedly taken for granted by the great founders of the Republic that the vexed problem of the connection of Church and State, which had caused so much misery in the world, was settled once and forever in the negative.

On Monday will be celebrated the birthday of the man, who, by refusing a crown, made the establishment of the Republic possible. He and his confreres felt that only by keeping religious questions out of the counsels of the Government altogether, was there any real possibility of avoiding the dangers of sectarianism. He once wrote: "Happily the Government of the United States, which grants to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens, in giving it on all occasions their effectual support." In these words the man of whom it has been said, "that he had no children that he might become the father of his country," struck the keynote of the true attitude of a free government in all religious questions.

With what clear insight Washington and the great Americans who stood with him at the cradle of this Government looked into the very heart of things. The past is of great value in teaching succeeding generations what to avoid, and if the past has any impressive lesson to teach, it is this of the absolute necessity of the complete separation of Church and State. For no matter what religious party or sect has the upper hand, others will suffer. Real liberty consists in freedom of thought and action for the individual as long as this does not interfere with the like liberty of all others.

But, were Washington to return to earth today he would witness strange sights in this land. He would hear of persistent and continued efforts to have an amendment added to the Constitution recognizing the religion of Jesus Christ as the religion of the land. He would learn that in 1892 the Supreme Court declared that this is a Christian nation; that in that same year Congress recognized Sunday observance; that in 1896 in the Thanksgiving proclamation the President called upon the people to observe the day in the name of Him through whose mediation we were taught how to pray.

He would learn that a few months ago a judge in New York City refused incorporation papers to a Jewish society because its meetings were to be held on Sunday; in rendering his decision he stated that although the law did not fordid the holding of meetings on that day in so many words, yet the intent of the law was such. He would learn that in the State of Tennessee a Seventh-day Baptist [Adventist] was sentenced to imprisonment for working on Sunday, although he conscientiously and religiously observed Saturday and refrained from all work on that day. Surely these are straws showing which way the wind is blowing. The breadth of spirit that characterized the founders of the Government has given way to a narrow sectarianism the worst feature of which is that it is finding its way into the halls of legislation.

As I recently perused an article in a leading Catholic paper, I wondered what our Protestant friends who are making these continued onslaughts on the Constitution and presenting petition after petition to have the Christian religion recognized as the State religion, would think of it. The bitterness of election contests in various sections of the country wherein the A. P. A. has taken a hand, may indicate what feelings would be engendered in the breasts of these bigoted Protestants at the very suggestion contained in that Catholic writer's contention that in time this will be a Catholic country.

Of course, as always, the difference is as to whose doxy. My doxy is all right; your doxy is all wrong. Truly, it is playing with two-edged tools. All open-minded men and women know that the policy of the complete separation of religion from government is the only safe course. There is nothing that gives greater cause for uneasiness than this reappearance of the narrow spirit of sect, class and race distinctions. The triumph of broad humanity and liberal thought is not yet complete. Despite parliaments of religion and international interests, despite a century of education in the school of liberalizing tendencies, these reactionary movements seem to be growing stronger.

The victories for freedom of thought and religious liberty that have been won can be none too jealously guarded. In this land lies the hope of the world. To be faithful to itself and its high mission it must persist in ever striving to give actual realization to those other words of the first President: "The citizens of the United States of America have a right to applaud themselves for having given to mankind examples of an enlarged and liberal policy, a policy worthy of imitation. All possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship. It is now no more that toleration is spoken of as if it were by the indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights."

"THAT which has everywhere characterized religious despotism, is the claim to prevent the public manifestation of individual differences of opinion."—De Pressensé.
