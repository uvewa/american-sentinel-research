## BY CITIZENS OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF CONNECTICUT

Efforts to induce the legislature of Connecticut to enact new legislation in the interests of Sunday observance, have prompted seventh-day observers in that State to protest to the governor and legislature against such measures, on the ground of their unjust character, and of the guaranties of religious freedom contained in the National and State constitutions.

The protest calls attention to the principles of justice and liberty upon which this Government was founded, as indicated in the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Great Seal of the United States, which pledges "a new order of things," the writings of Jefferson, Washington, and others; and to the following definite provision of the constitution of Connecticut upon the point in question:—

"ARTICLE 1. SEC. 3. The exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination, shall forever be free to all persons in this State, provided the right hereby declared and established shall not be so construed as to excuse acts of licentiousness, or to justify practices inconsistent with the peace and safety of the State.

"SEC. 4. No preference shall be given by the law to any Christian sect, or mode of worship."

The protest cites recent cases of religious persecution under Sunday laws in Tennessee and elsewhere, and quotes the following in reference to Sunday from a decision by Chief Justice Welch, of the Ohio Supreme Court:—

"The General Assembly of Ohio is not a guardian of the sanctity of the day. If it may protect the first day of the week from desecration because it is the Christian Sabbath, it may in like manner protect the sixth day because it is the holy day of the Mohammedan; and the seventh day because it is the Sabbath of the Jew and Seventh-day Baptist."

### NATURE OF TRUE SABBATH OBSERVANCE.

The nature of true Sabbath observance is set forth by the protest in the following:—

"The repeal of Sunday laws does not mean the abolition of the Sabbath. It means that the Sabbath shall be what God designed it to be, a free-will recognition of God's authority over the conscience, and therefore a distinguishing sign of those people who really worship God. The Bible says:—

"It is a sign between me and you. . . . that ye may know that I am the Lord which doth sanctify you."

"When that sign is enforced by arbitrary authority upon all, it ceases to be a sign of the sincere worshiper of God, and become a sign of the slavish submission of the soul to the State. It has been demonstrated in this nation, that religion and religious institutions have never been so prospered as when kept to themselves, without any aid or support from the State. Neither is it reasonable to suppose that this principle would be reversed in the matter of Sabbath observance, but that the claims of the Sabbath would receive far greater respect if only Christian methods were used to bring the institution before the people, instead of the mediaeval method of force. In proof of this we would quote an extract from an article in the New York Observer, by 'Holloway,' correspondent from California, where there are no Sunday laws. Speaking of San Francisco, he says:—

"Labor of all kinds can be carried on without hindrance. But while there is an absence of all Sunday laws, we must not draw the conclusion that there is no respect paid to the Lord's day. Truth compels us to state that San Francisco is a sabbath-keeping city. The drift is plainly in that direction. With very rare exceptions, you will find as much order and quiet in the streets as in some of our most favored Eastern cities. Those who knew California twenty years ago, now witness a far different order of things. The mass of the people respect and keep the Lord's day. No merchant of any respectability keeps his store open on the sabbath."

### FUTILITY OF SUNDAY LAWS.

Of the futility of Sunday laws, the protest says:—

"In 1885 Mr. Crafts published his book, 'The Sabbath for Man.' In this book he relates that in order to obtain a world-wide view of sabbath observance, he corresponded with many people in different parts of the world, asking them among other questions, the following:—

"'Where have you seen the best sabbath observance?'"

"To this a San Francisco clergyman responds—

''Among the Christian people of California.'

'Another statement in the same book is—

''Both laymen and ministers say that even in California the sabbath is, on the whole, better observed, and Christian services better attended than five years ago.'

''Five years ago,' at that time was three years before the repeal of the California Sunday law.''

Touching the proposed legislation, it says:—

"Against House Bill No. 186, entitled 'An Act Amending Section 1569 of General Statutes Relating to Work or Recreation on Sunday,' we most earnestly protest.

'We protest against this amendment because its object is to make more stringent the Sunday laws, which are already contrary to the principles of true Americanism. For a thousand years after Sunday began to be observed as a professedly Christian institution, and for a number of centuries after ordinary work was prohibited on that day, no one thought of prohibiting sports and recreation. Our Puritan ancestors were the first to make this attempt; and to antagonize their influence the laws regulating 'Field Sports' were passed during the reign of the Stuarts.

'This is a revival of Puritanism, per se. If its object were to prevent a nuisance in the form of a disturbance of public worship, it should apply alike to all days, since what constitutes such a nuisance on one day, would constitute the same nuisance on any other. But there are already laws to prevent such a nuisance; and so this, if that were its intent, would be cumulative legislation, and so unnecessary. If its object is to restrain the individual, and direct him for his own personal good, as to how he shall spend the day, we urge and protest that such laws are paternal, and un-American. The State is not the guardian of the individual health or welfare of its subjects.''

The basis of the Sabbatic institution, and the conscientious belief of some in the Word of God, are next referred to:—

## BASIS OF THE SABBATIC INSTITUTION.

'The fourth commandment of the Decalogue, which is almost universally acknowledged to be the basis of the Sabbatic institution, reads—

''Six days shall thou labor, and do all thy work; but the SEVENTH DAY is the SABBATH of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work.'

'We conscientiously believe that this means what it says, and that it therefore requires that men shall rest on the seventh day, and habitually work on the other six, including the first.''

In conclusion, the protest defines the attitude of those for whom it speaks in the matter of compulsory Sunday legislation, and briefly summarises their objections to the same, as follows:—

'We do not wish to compel others to either think or act as we do in this matter; but we deny their right to compel us, or to in any way molest us, on account of our religious faith and doctrine. While we are loyal supporters of civil government in civil things, yet we cannot habitually rest on Sunday, for we dare not do what to us is to disobey God, and to recognize a false and rival sabbath. God has given us the right to obey Him, not as men may happen to decide we ought, but as He by His Spirit guides us into the understanding of His Word; and the Constitution of Connecticut, before quoted, recognizes this right in every citizen, so long as he does not obstruct the worship of others.

'We believe, therefore, that this whole Sunday-law movement is a giant stride backward toward the Dark Ages.

'We believe it to be utterly inimical with both the principles of true Americanism, as defined by the fathers of this Republic.

'We believe that it is logically a complete repudiation of the 'new order of things' to which this Government stands pledged before the world.

'We believe that if it is permitted to go on, eclesiastricism will be revived, the chains of priestcraft will be forged anew, and the nineteenth century will darken into a night of oppression, instead of proving as it was hoped by the fathers of the Republic that it would, but the dawning of liberty.

'We therefore most earnestly petition the honorable members of the Legislature of Connecticut to stand as patriots for the principles of true Americanism, that this Government may teach, as it was once believed that it would, the lesson of liberty to the world.'
