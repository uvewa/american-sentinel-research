The European governments are again in a panic of fear, or are simulating fear in order to familiarize the minds of their subjects with the necessity for new armaments. In nearly every State with land frontiers to defend the parliaments are, or will soon be, confronted with extra military budgets, even Greece, Holland and Denmark being occupied with projects for fresh levies or increase of armaments. The mingled jealousy and fear on the Continent is so strong that the minutest change in military organization and equipment on the part of one power is instantly noted and followed by the others; that men and guns are counted as carefully as if they were gold pieces, and the alteration of a shoe buckle becomes at once the subject of military discussion. The discovery of a new high explosive, or the invention of a new kind of gunpowder, creates a perfect frenzy of apprehension, and all artillery and rifles must be immediately adjusted to them or created anew, even if it takes the last dollar in the treasuries and mortgages the future.

In the present instance it is France that has started the alarm with the new quick firing Canet gun, which throws a shrapnel shell loaded with 300 bullets five times a minute, with a range of nearly 7,000 metres, and her request for extra infantry battalions amounting to an increase of 70,000 men. Germany is alarmed in turn, or pretends that she is, in order to drag new credits out of the pockets of her subjects, her newspapers shrieking that with such an increase of French armament, the destruction of the German Empire is threatened. Accordingly, she will, it is reported, expend fifty million dollars in new quick-firing guns, of her own model, the largest isolated expenditure on war material yet known, and will, in addition, create new infantry regiments and reorganize her battalions and brigades. This expansion of armaments will, it is held, necessitate a large increase of war preparation on the part of Austria, which cannot, or will think she cannot, lose her place in the unending race toward war without risks too heavy to bear.

So the struggle goes on, every nation having a lurking fear that it is approaching the end of its resources, yet so oppressed with jealousy and fear that it is unwilling to lighten in any particular the crushing burden of armor it carries. There is not a government that has any confidence in its neighbors, or any feeling of security though armored to the toes, and so continues its preparations as if war were only a question of to-morrow, and was certainly one of next year. Every one of them knows that but for their jealousies, which are not policies upon the maintenance of which their existence depends, but only vulgar jealousies, they might save annually hundreds of millions of money and release two millions of men for the arts of peace; but not one of them is willing to trust the other.

And the worst feature of it all is that there is no probability of any change, for the nations which have struggled on in this way for twenty years can do so for twenty years more, and will do so until some cure for their fears not yet suggested has been found. A war which would kill off a whole generation of men and set the clock of civilization back fifty years might bring back the reign of common sense, though we are not hopeful. As for universal arbitration and disarmament, it is a mere dream of enthusiasts.
