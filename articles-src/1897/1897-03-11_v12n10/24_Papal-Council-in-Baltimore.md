It is announced from Washington, D. C., that news has been received from Rome that the Pope is preparing a bull addressed to the Catholic hierarchy in the United States calling for a "plenary council" in Baltimore on May 1. This has been done, it is said, by the special advice of Satolli. Mgr. Martinelli will preside at the Council, and will be vested with plenary powers, giving him ecclesiastical preeminence over all other prelates in this country while the session continues. The subjects which will receive special attention, it is said, are public instruction, nationalism, and papal doctrine on the subject of secret societies.
