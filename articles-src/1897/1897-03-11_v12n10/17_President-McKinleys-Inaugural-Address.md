A passage which invites criticism in President McKinley's inaugural address is the following:—

"Equality of rights must prevail and our laws be always and everywhere respected and obeyed. We may have failed in the discharge of our full duty as citizens of the great Republic, but it is consoling and encouraging to realize that free speech, a free press, free thought, free schools, the free and unmolested right of religious liberty and worship, and free and fair elections, are dearer and more universally enjoyed to-day than ever before."

In saying this the President must certainly be in ignorance of the facts. There was a time not many years since when such a thing as the imprisonment of honest, conscientious men for refusing to keep Sunday, was unheard-of,—when people declared such a thing could never be. But what is the situation now? The table of imprisonments given in another column answers the question. It is neither "consoling" nor "encouraging" to the victims of religious legislation to reflect upon the degree of their enjoyment of the "free and unmolested right of religious liberty and worship."
