Some of the statements made at the "Christian Citizenship" rally in Washington, reported above, were quite characteristic of the effort to defend the character of Sunday laws. One speaker, for instance, said that "Congress has again and again enacted Sunday laws," and hence Sunday laws must be right, for Congress could not be mistaken so many times. But recollecting that Congress itself sometimes works on Sunday, he said, "When they work on Sunday it is still Saturday, not Sunday"! This must be on the principle that by turning back the hands of the clock which tells the assembled legislators the time of day, Congress can prolong the last hours of an expiring session without going beyond the day fixed for its close. As a matter of fact, Sunday sessions of one or the other houses of Congress are of comparatively frequent occurrence, the last instance of this being the session of the Senate on Sunday, February 28.
