How that Protestantism, so-called, which denies the miraculous in Scripture, is putting a weapon into the hands of Rome, may be seen by the following from the *Catholic Standard and Times*:—

"The example in Bible-smashing set by the Rev. Dr. Lyman Abbott, is becoming contagious. Not only did he continue his iconoclastic work last Sunday by attacking the character of the Canticle of Canticles (the Protestant Song of Solomon), but another Congregationalist minister, the Rev. Dr. William Lloyd, of New York, declared his disbelief in Balaam's ass having actually spoken to the prophet.

"I believe,' he said, 'that this talking took place in the prophet's own mind. His conscience put the words into the dumb animal's mouth. The angel in his pathway was also a phantom conjured by his guilty conscience.'

"Rationalism is evidently gaining on Protestantism with giant strides."
