It is one thing to say that the Bible, as we have it to-day, contains many passages which are not perfect translations of the original text, and quite another thing to say that the Bible is not infallible. There may be many places where the best words were not used in translation, but the teaching of the Bible is truth, in every book and every text; and that truth can be discovered by a prayerful study of the text, comparing scripture with scripture, as its divine Author intended should be done. The Bible is infallible; and our eminent theologians would admit it if they were not so sure that they are infallible themselves.
