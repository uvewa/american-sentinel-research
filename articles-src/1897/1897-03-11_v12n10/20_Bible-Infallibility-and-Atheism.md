The editor of the leading organ of American Methodism, who recently created a "scene" at a meeting of Methodist ministers, by declaring that the English Bible is not infallible, now says that what he said was nothing but "a truism old as the centuries." But if it was nothing anyway, why did he take the trouble to bring it before a meeting of three hundred Methodist ministers? We would suppose that such an assemblage would hardly need to be reminded of a "truism old as the centuries."

In this position Dr. Buckley is indorsed by Lyman Abbott, and the latter is in turn approved by "Bob" Ingersoll. When men deny the infallibility of the Bible, English or otherwise, they place themselves in a line which has an applauding atheist at the other end of it.
