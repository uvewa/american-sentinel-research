The spirit of the traffic represented by the saloon is strikingly shown in the following words reported as having been spoken by an official of the Ohio Liquor League, at a recent meeting of that body:—

"It will appear from these facts, gentlemen, that the success of our business is dependent largely upon the creation of appetite for drink. Men who drink liquor, like others, will die, and if there is no new appetite created, our counters will be empty, as will be our coffers. Our children will go hungry, or we must change our business to that of some other more remunerative.

"The open field for the creation of this appetite is among the boys. After men have grown and their habits are formed, they rarely ever change in this regard. It will be needful, therefore, that missionary work be done among the boys, and I make the suggestion, gentlemen, that nickels expended in treats to the boys now, will return in dollars to your tills after the appetite has been formed. Above all things, create appetite."

The Union Signal, of January 28, prints the above, and adds: "Such a statement seems absolutely fiendish; and yet, whether spoken or unspoken, the fact remains that the traffic exists only by recruits from among the boys. 'Wanted, a hundred thousand boys,' must be the constant motto of this infamous business, that a few may grow rich and their children live in luxury while their patrons go down to the lowest depths of degradation and poverty."

Yet the Union Signal favors a Sunday-closing law, by which this hideous Moloch would have legal authority for the propagation of his awful work; for it cannot be denied that a Sunday-closing law means legal sanction of the saloon on other days of the week. How can Christians advocate any compromise with this evil? How can Christianity compromise with anything that is "fiendish"? Why should there be a Sunday law for the liquor traffic, any more than a Sunday law for murder?
