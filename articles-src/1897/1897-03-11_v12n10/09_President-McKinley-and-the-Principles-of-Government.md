In his inaugural address, President McKinley said:—

"The great essential to our happiness and prosperity is that we adhere to the principles upon which the Government was established, and insist upon their faithful observance."

No more truthful utterance could have been made; and we trust it will be kept in mind by the President and also by Congress when they are being urged, as they certainly will be, to depart from those principles by enacting the so-called "Christian" amendment to the Constitution, which would incorporate the "revealed will of Jesus Christ" into the civil law of the land. "The principles upon which the Government was established" separate the State from religion; and they were adopted not because the men who established the Government were irreligious, for they were not; but because they had read and profited by the lessons of history upon that point, and had too much respect for the Christian religion to be willing to see it drawn into the arena of political contention. They believed in religious liberty, which means equality for all religions before the law. Shall this fundamental principle of our Government now be set aside? The attitude of Congress and the President toward the "Christian" amendment will furnish the answer to this question.
