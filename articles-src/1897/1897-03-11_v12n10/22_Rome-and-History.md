In view of the complaints made nowadays by Rome's prelates about the "perversion" of history by "Protestant historians," it may be interesting to know what they would regard as proper history. Here is a sample, taken from an address by Cardinal Moran, Archbishop of Sydney:—

"But, in the thirteenth century, the burghers and citizens successfully asserted their claim of liberty, and broad and solid were laid the foundations of what we cherish to-day as our most precious political heritage. 'For Northern Europe,' says Mr. Harrison, 'the thirteenth century is the era of the definite establishment of rich, free, self-governing municipalities.'"

The Papacy will not be satisfied with anything short of "history" which will eulogize the Dark Ages.
