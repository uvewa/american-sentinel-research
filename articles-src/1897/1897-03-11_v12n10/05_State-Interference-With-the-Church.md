It would seem from the following which appears in The Outlook of February 13, that Congregationalism in the State of New York has been very seriously restricted, if not practically abolished, by State legislation recently enacted governing religious corporations:

"By the 'Religious Corporations Law' passed in 1895, without, so far as we have been able to discover, any knowledge or suspicion on the part of the churches generally, and certainly with a total absence of information on the subject among nine-tenths of the churches affected thereby, Congregationalism has been abolished in the State of New York.

"We should have a right to expect in such a law, adopted in a process of codification, simplicity and system. But these qualities are conspicuously lacking. It is not easy to understand what the Religious Corporations Law of 1895 means, nor what its real effect will be. Certain of its provisions are, however, painfully clear. The distinction between church and society is abolished. All persons of full age who are members in good and regular standing, or who have been stated attendants on divine worship in the church and have regularly contributed to its support for the year next preceding, are made qualified voters at all meetings, spiritual and temporal. At every such meeting the pastor, if present, must preside, and in his absence the oldest officer of the church. This presiding officer has the absolute right to 'receive the votes, be the judge of the qualifications of voters, and declare the result of the votes cast on any matter.' He may keep the polls open at the annual meeting just as long as he likes, so as to give his friends time to drum up absent voters from any quarter; or he can shut them up at the end of one hour, subject only to an appeal to the qualified voters present, at which he will do the counting.

"Finally, Congregationalists are apparently furnished with a 'governing religious body' in the American Congregational Union, and Baptists with a 'governing religious body' in the Baptist Missionary Convention. We say apparently, for one section seems to make this provision, another seems to recognize that there are some denominations which have no governing religious body, and by one act in 1896 the Baptists appear to be taken out from the operation of this law altogether, and by another act to be put back under its operation. It is, at all events, provided that if any church 'has failed for two consecutive years to maintain religious services according to the discipline, customs, and usages of such governing body, or has had less than thirteen resident attending members paying annually pew rent, or making annual contribution toward its support,' it may be declared by such governing body to be extinct, and the body may proceed to take possession of its property 'and apply the proceeds thereof to any of the purposes to which the property of such governing religious body is devoted.'

"Under this law members of a Congregational church who have ceased for years to attend upon its services, but have not been stricken from its rolls, may be brought in at any time to outvote those who have regularly attended and regularly contributed to its support. They may fix the salary of the pastor, may employ and discharge or fix the salaries of any other officers, they may, indeed, give any directions not inconsistent with positive law; and the trustees have no option except to obey.

"So the pastor, instead of being any longer one of the brethren, having leadership only in spiritual affairs, is given a control wholly foreign to the spirit of Congregationalism. He determines who can vote, and he may keep the polls open as long as may be necessary to drum up voters to support him in a contested election. In his absence the oldest person who holds any church office becomes presiding officer in his place. There is not even any distinction between the kind of officers, after the church is once organized. The oldest and most decrepit man or woman who has been intrusted with any little office in the church has the right to take the chair and do all the counting. No appeal lies from the decision thus made, except by taking the case into the Supreme Court.

"Finally, the whole idea of independency, which is fundamental to both Congregational and Baptist discipline, is cast aside. The churches are no longer free to determine their own creed, ritual, and method of government. They are required to conform to the 'discipline, customs, and usages of such governing body,' although the very essence of Congregationalism is that there is no governing body and that no church is under any obligation to conform to any discipline, customs, or usages, but is a pure, spiritual democracy, with no law over it but the law of Christ, to be interpreted by itself. Thus the independence of Congregational and Baptist churches, so nobly maintained during a struggle of two centuries, and never questioned in the third century of their existence, is destroyed at a blow by a piece of secret legislation, pushed through without attracting the slightest public attention. The legislation would not be worse if the law forbade bishops to exercise any supervision in an Episcopal church, or abolished the Session, Presbytery and Synod, and General Assembly in the Presbyterian Church and required all churches to be independent.

"The Congregational and the Baptist churches should at once take this matter up; they should discuss it in their church and associational meetings; they should study this law and understand its bearings; they should seek the counsel of the best ecclesiastical lawyers, and then they should make common cause to secure the abolition of a statute which might well be entitled 'An Act to Abolish Independency and to Secure Uniformity of Church Government and Worship in all Independent Churches.'"

Doubtless the authors of this legislation had no intention of abolishing Congregationalism in this State; and that this has been virtually done, as the Outlook declares, only illustrates how easily the power of the State may be made to invade religious freedom. The State has of course the right to legislate in regard to religious corporations, covering the merely civil relation which such bodies bear as corporations to the State. But the State has no shadow of right to undertake to regulate the internal affairs of a church as it would those of a corporation. Very likely the State has been moved to this kind of legislation by a disposition on the part of the churches to make use of the State's power in the regulation and settlement of church matters. Let the Church rely upon the power and wisdom of God for her success; and let the State refrain from any intrusion upon the affairs of the Church.
