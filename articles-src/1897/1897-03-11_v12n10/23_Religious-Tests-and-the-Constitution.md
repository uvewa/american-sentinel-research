The New York *World*, of February 28, very properly takes exception to opposition directed against a Cabinet appointee on account of his religious belief, and defends him by quoting the First Amendment to the Constitution, which forbids religious legislation by Congress and any congressional abridgment of freedom of speech. What the *World* should have quoted, however, is that clause of the Constitution which forbids any religious test in determining the fitness of a candidate for public office. There would be less open disregard of the Constitution if there were less ignorance on the part of the people respecting the constitutional safeguards of their rights.
