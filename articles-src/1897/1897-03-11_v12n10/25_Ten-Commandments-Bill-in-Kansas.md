A Kansas legislator named Walters has, if report be true, introduced in the law-making body of his State, a bill to give statutory force to the Ten Commandments. In support of his bill he said that "the men of the present generation have become doubters and scoffers," and that "having no fear of punishment beyond the grave, they continually violate the law given on Mount Sinai." Religious people are nowadays getting so intoxicated with the idea of making people moral by law, that there is not much reason to doubt the truth of this report.
