An exchange scores a point on Sunday-law advocates who hold to the doctrine of evolution, in the following:—

"Some of the clergy who believe that the six 'days' of creation in Genesis mean six geological periods of incomputable length are heard quoting the fourth commandment as authority for Sunday idleness. The commandment sets out that God made the world in six days and rested on the seventh. Why, then, haven't we a Sunday law enforcing rest for a 'geological period'?"

SUNDAY, February 28, the Sunday law was generally enforced for the first time upon barbers in New York City. The Corporation Council being called upon for a strict construction of the law, have decided that barbers must not shave customers on Sunday after 1 o'clock P.M., except when the customer is actually in the chair at that hour. If he is only waiting to be shaved when the clock strikes one he must go unkempt.

THE Corcoran art gallery in Washington, D. C., was opened on Sunday to the public for the first time, February 28. Nearly four thousand people improved the opportunity to view the collection of art treasures, the majority being of the class who find in Sunday their only day of recreation. The result was taken as fully vindicating the action of the trustees in opening the gallery for Sunday visitation.

THE Bridgeport, Conn., Evening Post, of February 26, reports a case in court in that city—"the Spiritual Temple Case"—in which the judge said in his charge to the jury, "You are to determine who is the true God." Such a report seems almost incredible, but in these days a person must be prepared to expect almost anything in the way of developments savoring of a union of Church and State.

IN a matter of the defense of personal rights, one individual stands for the whole people. When individual liberty is attacked in any instance, the whole people are made defendants. When individualism falls, the whole people fall with it.

A SPOKANE, WASH., journal reports that the Sunday law is enforced in Colfax, that State, with much "success." Even the most liberal sections of the great West seem to be fast retrograding to the medieval idea of enforced religion.

THE idea that it is better for Christians to go to a primary than to a prayer-meeting, when the two fall on the same evening, is characteristic of that religion which demands the enforcement of Sunday.

A BILL prohibiting all Sunday sports and games is now under consideration by the legislature of New York.
