In the question column of the Golden Rule [Christian Endeavor organ], of January 28, is the following:—

"J. H. A., Westerly, R. I. Christ's teachings regarding the Sabbath should release all Christians from the formalism that in Christ's own day had so largely destroyed the spirit of true Sabbath observance. The value of the Sabbath consists not in observing a certain day any more than the value of prayer consists in the way we bow our heads or kneel, or the value of the sermon consists in the dress the minister wears. It is not known when the transfer was made from the Jewish Sabbath to the Christian sabbath, but it was a transfer that undoubtedly had apostolic authority. It grew up from the instinctive reverence of the early Christians for the day on which our Lord rose from the grave and ascended into heaven, and from shrinking from celebrating the day in which he remained in the grave."

Analyze this teaching for Christian Endeavorers.

1. There is no more importance attached to "observing a certain day" as the Sabbath, than there is in the form of dress a clergyman may wear, or the position which the body assumes when one prays. That is certainly no-Sabbathism loose enough for the most liberal. Now Sunday is surely a definite and "certain day," a fixed day of the week, and since Sabbath-keeping need not be associated with any one "certain day," it need not be fixed on Sunday, or associated with it. What an excellent theory to cultivate regard for Sabbath reform on Sunday!

2. It is not known when Sunday was put in place of the Sabbath, but "undoubtedly" it was done by "apostolic authority." If the last "undoubtedly" be correct, it can be known easily when it was done. "Apostolic authority" cannot be without the sanction, example or precept, or both, of the apostles; and if it be precepts without example there must be some clear and definite reason why inspired apostles did not follow their own precepts. It happens that the records of the apostolic precepts, and the doings of apostolic men, are confined to a brief period and a plain, uncontested record. The Golden Rule defies logic and history, and "begs the whole question" at issue when it attempts to hide behind such an "undoubtedly," without even a reference, much less a quotation, from the Word of God. Is that teaching young people to build their faith on the Scriptures? Is that loose way of avoiding a vital issue preparing young people to be stalwart Sabbath reformers? . . .

All this comes because the *Golden Rule* does not dare to follow the Bible and the example of Christ in keeping the Sabbath.
