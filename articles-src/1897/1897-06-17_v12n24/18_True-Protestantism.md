True Protestants are united in vindicating the rights of conscience and in protesting against intolerance.

True Protestants are united in fighting for the liberty of their antagonists as earnestly as for the liberty of their friends, ever preferring to be among the persecuted than among the persecutors.

True Protestants are united in rejecting the use of the civil power, ever preferring to see the gospel oppressed when deliverance from oppression must be obtained by the use of carnal weapons.—Count A. de Gasparin, 1852.
