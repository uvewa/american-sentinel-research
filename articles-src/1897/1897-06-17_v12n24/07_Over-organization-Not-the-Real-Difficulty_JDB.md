RECENTLY, on assuming editorial control of the *Arena*, Mr. John Clark Ridpath, the historian, contributed an interesting paper on "Democracy—Its Origin and Prospects." After pointing out what he considers its three great sources, and sketching the progress of the doctrine of equality, he says that to-day it is evident that there has been a manifest decline in the principles of bold, free democracy. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the United States, a country which originally contained much of promise to lovers of freedom, but which is now "not without its striking analogy to that imperial Republic of Rome, which preceded the empire." Then he exclaims:—

"In the name of reason and history, why is it that this tremendous miscarriage seems to threaten the American Republic? Why is it that here, as elsewhere in all the civilized countries, the ruin and suppression of democracy seem to impend?"

He answers these "tremendous questions," as follows:—

"Democracy has in all countries been crippled by the over-organization of society. . . . Human society begins in equality; it is organized into inequality. . . . It is the common experience of mankind that organization becomes more and more excessive with the progress of a given people until they find themselves overdone and mastered by their own vehicle. . . . Races and nations have been organized to death."

There is much truth in these observations, but over-organization is not the real difficulty. Instead of being the cause of the subversion of democracy, it is but a manifestation of the cause, an important means by which that end is accomplished. The real difficulty is found in the answer to the question, Why does society over-organize? And this may be answered in a word—society over-organizes because the individuals composing it are selfish.

It is the common experience of mankind that in no country have men long been content with equality. In no respect has man more plainly shown his subserviency to the arch-rebel who said, "I will exalt my throne above the stars of God," than in this his supreme passion—the desire to get above and to control his fellows. Organization (or over-organization—for that is what it is when used in this way) affords an effective means for the accomplishment of their desire. It concentrates power and enables a few men to control other men and other things for their own benefit. Its tendency is to make men the slaves of men.

Under cover of the organized machine, that is attempted and accomplished which would not be dared by open and direct force. In short, selfishness is what is indicated by all over-organization. It is at the root of labor trusts, oil trusts, sugar trusts, church trusts, pools and combines of every description, offensive and defensive alliances, and the excessively over-organized militarism of Christendom.

It is useless to deal with organizations and attempt to keep them at the proper point. The only cure is to get love into the heart instead of selfishness, for each individual to "sanctify the Lord of hosts himself," and let God be his fear and his dread. Then there will be no desire to say "a confederacy," for it will be known that associations are powerless to save, and that they mean only destruction.
