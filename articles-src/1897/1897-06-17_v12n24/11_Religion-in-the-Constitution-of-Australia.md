THE Australian Federal Convention refused to insert a recognition of God in the preamble of the Constitution which it was the purpose of the session to draft, notwithstanding the importunities of the Presbyterian and some other churches in that country. The Convention decided to deal fairly in this matter with all parties and classes of the people to be governed by the new Constitution; and as this is God's manner of dealing with people, God is in the Constitution in a very practical sense. But He certainly would not be in a Constitution which favored one class of people above others, for God is no respecter persons. He sendeth his rain on the just and on the unjust, and maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good alike. And only those who manifest the same disposition in their dealings with their fellows can consistently profess to be his children.

But the controversy over the question of a constitutional "recognition" of God is not yet ended; for the Church-and-State party hope to carry their point before the Constitution is finally ratified as the fundamental law of the land.

At the session of a commission of the Presbyterian Assembly, held in May, much attention was given to this matter, and it was moved that a committee of Presbyterians lobby at the colonial parliaments for the purpose of counteracting the vote of the Convention, and of securing more recognition of Sunday as a sacred day. Mention was made of the Seventh-day Adventists as having manifested a formidable opposition to the scheme for securing the proposed establishment of religion by the State.
