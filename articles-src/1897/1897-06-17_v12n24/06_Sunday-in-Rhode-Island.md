The agitation for stringent Sunday legislation in Providence, R. I., still continues, but an effort is being made to save Sunday diversions and amusements at Roger Williams Park from the prohibitions of the law. Under the present statutes, it is said, "a simple request for the Chief [of police] to enforce the laws would be sufficient to prevent helpful and healthy amusement on the first day, and if the head of the police department was inclined to follow the letter of the law, to stop the running of street-car, steamboats and the like." In the endeavor to place Sunday enforcement upon a "liberal" basis, the following bill was introduced in the legislature May 18:—

"SECTION 1. Section 17 of Chapter 281 of the General Laws is hereby amended to read as follows:

"Sec. 17. Every person who shall do or exercise any labor or business or work of his ordinary calling on the first day of the week, or suffer the same to be done by his children, servants or apprentices, works of necessity and charity only excepted, shall be fined not exceeding five dollars for the first offense and ten dollars for the second and every subsequent offense.

"Provided that nothing in this section shall be so construed as to prohibit the operation of steamboats, steam or electric railroads, the use of amusements at any public park of any city or town, in the discretion of the lawfully constituted authorities of said park, the publishing, selling and delivery of newspapers, or the opening of drug stores whose owners are registered pharmacists. Town Councils and City Councils by virtue of the powers vested in them by Chapter 40, Sections 21 and 22, may in their discretion prohibit the use by any person of any game, sport, play or recreation on the first day of the week.

"Sec. 2. All acts or parts of acts inconsistent herewith are hereby repealed.

"Sec. 3. This act shall take effect immediately."

This measure has, it is said, assurance of strong support in its effort to become law; in which event it would materially modify the danger of an enforced Puritan Sunday which now threatens.

Let nobody be deceived, however, by any modifications of Sunday laws to a more liberal form. The public will get what it wants in the line of Sunday legislation, and their sports and amusements, and the Sunday business of powerful corporations, will not be seriously disturbed. But this will not in the least prevent the heavy hand of "the law" from descending upon the few who keep the commandments of God. That is the way the "discretion" vested in city and State officials will, sooner or later, be manifested.
