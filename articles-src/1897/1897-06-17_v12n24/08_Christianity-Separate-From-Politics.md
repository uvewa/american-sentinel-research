It is the teaching of the SENTINEL that Christianity will not unite with politics, and that Christians cannot properly engage in the political contentions and strife which mark the life of the world around them. In this, the SENTINEL aims to set forth what it finds plainly taught in the Word of God. How this theory works in practice, under circumstances calculated to put its value to the test, is told in the following communication from an Adventist missionary to Turkey, in the *Present Truth*, of May 27:—

"Our workers in Turkey have passed through many peculiar experiences. Wherever they have gone and aroused an interest, they have soon been interfered with by the authorities. This was not because the Turks were especially hostile to our work, but rather because the situation is such in Turkey as to give any who desire to hinder one's activity, special advantages for doing so.

"The Armenians have always chafed under the Turkish yoke, and have agitated in favor of national liberty. To this end they have used all means within their power at home, and have also endeavored to enlist the sympathy and help of foreign powers to gain their long-coveted end. As they saw one after another of the Balkan States gain either total or semi-independence, they felt as though their time had come, and in late years have been especially active. This led to the late great outbreak and massacres. In consequence of their increasing activity, the Turkish government was proportionately active in suppressing them. This made it difficult for our Armenian laborers to go from place to place; and as soon as they held public meetings and awakened an interest, only a word was necessary by some prejudiced person to stir up the authorities against them.

"With scarcely an exception, every time our laborers have gone forth and aroused an interest, difficulty from this quarter has overtaken them; and in almost every case the difficulty was occasioned by the complaint of Armenian or Greek Christians. This resulted in many arrests; but the outcome of it all was that the government ascertained that our Seventh-day Adventist brethren were not political agitators; that they respected governments, and believed that as Christians, and followers of Christ whose kingdom is not of this world, we have nothing to do with revolution, or the overthrow of civil rulers, no matter how oppressive they may be. Had our brethren taken any part in political matters, they would have fared like the rest when the massacres came, instead of escaping, as they did, in every instance.

"The Lord made the government acquainted with the position of our brethren on this point through what seemed at the time to be hindrances. Again and again they were arrested. It seemed hard to bear, and we did not know what the end would be; but the Lord was preparing the way for a great deliverance in the time of trouble that was to come on the Armenians. Now we can see that what appeared to be difficulties were but blessings in disguise. Had our brethren waited until the difficulties began, before declaring their principles, it would not have freed them, as the Turks would have believed that this was only a dodge to save themselves. It was necessary to have this fact well established before the trouble began.

"Quite a number of our people in Turkey are Greeks, and what the present war may bring forth for Greeks in Turkey it is difficult to tell. But we are sure that if these brethren trust wholly in the Lord, the same wonderful providence that was over our Armenian brethren through the Armenian massacres will be over them.

"The degree to which the true situation of our people is understood by the Turk, is well illustrated by the experience of an Armenian priest, who, in order to cause trouble, tried to make a Turkish ruler believe that contributions for the spread of the truth were really for political purposes. A brother writes of it as follows:—

"At Shagshag the Armenian priest together with an Armenian layman called at Yahovah's government and complained against our brethren as though they were collecting tithes to send to Armenia to help the insurgents. The Turkish ruler asked the priest to state these things in a written petition. Then the priest called on the Turkish petition writer. [In Turkey many people are unable to write, and every village has one or more scribes, whose business it is to write documents and letters for the people.] But he at once refused to write such stuff, saying "Sabbatarians never do such things." Then the priest called on another clerk, and received the same answer; then on a third one, and again the same answer. The priest then called on the ruler without the writing, saying, "The clerks refuse to write." Then the ruler sends for all the brethren at Shagshag, and examines them closely about this tithe question; and from each one obtains the same answer, that the tithe is not used for Armenians, but for the Lord's cause—for the preaching of the gospel. The ruler then sent them away in peace. Thus Armenians accused us before the government for the same things that they themselves do, while we work for the Lord.

"These experiences contain an important lesson for all, as we are coming to a time of trouble for the nations

"such as never was," much worse than that experienced in Turkey. But the Lord is now at work preparing people for this very time, teaching them the position which His children should occupy in the world. It is important that we stand wholly on the principles of the gospel, and so be separated from the world. Then the Lord can do for us what He could not if we were not entirely separated. H. P. HOLSER."
