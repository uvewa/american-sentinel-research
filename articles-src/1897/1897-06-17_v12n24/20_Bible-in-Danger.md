Dr. Charles A. Berry, of London, recently remarked that "the most imminent danger to the Bible to-day is the man who would fight like a Trojan for the orthodox theory of inspiration, but does not sit down and read the Book for himself." The Bible itself is in no danger, of course; for it stands by the power of God. But there are very many people who are in danger of incurring eternal disaster because they are more willing to show their Christian zeal by fighting than by humbly seeking for divine instruction.
