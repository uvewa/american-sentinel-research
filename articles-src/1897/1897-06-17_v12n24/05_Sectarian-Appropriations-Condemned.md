At a meeting of the Washington Secular League, May 31, the subject of "Sectarian Appropriations" was considered, and the following resolutions were unanimously adopted:—

"WHEREAS, Franklin said, 'A religion that depends on the State for its support is, for that reason, a bad religion;' Jefferson said, 'It is wicked and tyrannical to compel any man to support a religion in which he does not believe;' Grant said, 'Keep Church and State forever separate,' and Garfield said, 'The divorce between Church and State should be absolute;'

"WHEREAS, Sectarian appropriations wring from unwilling contributors tax-money for supporting sects in which they do not believe, and

"WHEREAS, The injustice of any religion asking, accepting, or indorsing such unjust sectarian appropriations outweighs all its professed charity, thus neutralizing its influence for good; therefore, be it

"Resolved, That neither our Federal, State, nor municipal governments should ever hereafter make any sectarian appropriations whatever.

"Resolved, That every church, which, by its silence regarding these unjust sectarian appropriations virtually consents thereto, thereby stands convicted of indorsing injustice.

"Resolved, That reform, like charity, begins at home, and that until these unjust churches reform themselves, they can do but little good elsewhere, and are therefore undeserving of any government aid whatever."

No church, however, can be deserving of government aid, under any circumstances, so long as it is true that Church and State should be kept separate.
