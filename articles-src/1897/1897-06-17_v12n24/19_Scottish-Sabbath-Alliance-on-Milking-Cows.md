The New York Press, of June 10, is authority for the following:—

"The Scottish Sabbath Alliance has come to the conclusion that milking cows on Sunday is sin. A series of experiments has demonstrated that if the cows be not fed on Saturday they will not need to be milked on Sunday. The next step will be to use gags which will prevent any mooing."
