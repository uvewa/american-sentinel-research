As was to be expected, the fourth of July is to share the fate of other national days is being appropriated to the uses of "Christian Citizenship." A suggested programme, which has been sent out "To all ministers and Christian patriots" from the headquarters of the National Christian Citizenship League, in Chicago, provides for observing "The New Fourth of July" with "rousing celebrations on definite Christian citizenship lines." The programme is as follows:

"5:30 A. M.—Firing of salute of seven or thirteen guns, immediately followed by simultaneous peals from all the church bells, lasting five minutes.

"6:00 A. M.—Union sunrise prayer meetings. Everybody invited.

"9:00 A. M.—Band concert or other music at place of rendezvous.

"9:30 A. M.—Form procession and march to various churches. Short service at each church, somewhat as follows:

"1. Sing 'America' (two verses); (2) short prayer; (3) run the flag to top of steeple or otherwise decorate church with flags; (4) reading of the call of the National Christian Citizenship League; (5) sing 'Coronation' (two verses). Continue line of march to next church. At each church have similar programme, varying the verses of 'America' and 'Coronation,' or using other hymns of like character. Leave the flags on each church until the following Monday at least. From last church decorated march procession to the park or grove where the chief exercises are to be held.

"12:00 M.—Basket dinner.

"1:30 P. M.—Music, band, chorus-singing of united choirs, school children, etc. Patriotic and Christian hymns.

"2:00 P. M.—Assembly called to order at speakers' stand for a programme, to include singing, a prayer, two or three ringing speeches of not over twenty minutes each, reading of the call of the National Christian Citizenship League. Presentation of the Christian citizenship crusade for enlistments.

"Close, singing 'Coronation.'"

In no way does it occur to us that the union of Church and State which "Christian Citizenship" embodies could be more fittingly symbolized than by the flying of the Government flag from the spires of the churches.
