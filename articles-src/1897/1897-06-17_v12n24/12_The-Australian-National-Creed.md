THE Adelaide Church of England Church News, of March 26, commenting on the petitions which the churches are sending to the Federal Convention, says:—

"We, the members of the Church of England in Australia and Tasmania, desire that in the preamble of the bill which frames the Federal Constitution some words may be inserted setting forth our national creed."

And it adds:—

"In this matter, we thank God, we are entirely at one with all the Protestant bodies of Christians in this city and colony."

And it further says:—

"It is unlikely that our Roman Catholic brethren will fail to show their approval of the main principle."

This is plain language, and shows just what we have maintained from the first, that the design of the petition of the Council of Churches is to establish a "national creed."

And any principle implying such a thing Protestants may rest perfectly assured will be approved of by "our Roman Catholic brethren." The Roman Catholic church indorsed that principle over a thousand years ago. Upon that the whole system of the papacy was built, and out of it grew all the evils and horrors and bitter persecutions of the Dark Ages. When the papacy approves of that principle she approves of her own; and when professed Protestants approve of it, and ask her to approve of it, they are both denying the fundamental principles of true Protestantism and clasping hands with that church, whose history for twelve long centuries is written in the blood of the saints.

We are glad to say there is one church that is not "at one with all the Protestant bodies" in demanding a union of Church and State. It is the Seventh-day Adventist church. This church protests against the whole business, and declares for religious freedom.
