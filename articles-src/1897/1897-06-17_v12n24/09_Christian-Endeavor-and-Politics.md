The position at which the Christian Endeavor movement has arrived in the evolution of its purpose to reform society, is indicated in the following from a newspaper report of an Endeavor rally held in New York City, June 7:—

"The yearly rally of the Christian Endeavor Societies of the Fifth District was held last night in the Second Collegiate Church of Harlem, and was quickly turned into a red-hot political rally by the new city magistrate, Job E. Hedges, Robert Fulton Cutting and the Rev. William Justin Harsha.

"We want to hold up good citizenship in all its essentials," said Mr. Cutting, and he hinted that the only way to do it was to join the Citizens' Union and stand by its candidates. By way of a parenthesis he added that he had some membership blanks with him, and would be pleased to furnish them to any one who wished to join the Union.

"We are going," continued Mr. Cutting, "to give the people a chance to put men in office who are beyond question, and men who will carefully administer your affairs. We ask favor of no man. Honesty and virtue should be the only characteristics of the officials of the city. We rely on the young men and young women of the Christian Endeavor to help along Christian citizenship, and to work for men to honestly and admirably administer city affairs."

The speaker went on to eulogize several well-known officials of the city government, and the report adds that "some of the young Endeavorers writhed in their seats at the straight-out politics which he talked."

But what did they expect, and what does anybody expect from the Christian Endeavor movement, but straight-out politics? The mere fact that it has not affiliated with any recognized political party counts for nothing as a preventive against this. The organization has adopted political principles of action, and this in itself gives it a political character. It is working to gain control of governmental power by means of the ballot, for the purposes it has in view; and this is exactly what other political bodies are doing. It is virtually a political party like all the rest.

The sooner those Christian Endeavorers—and we know there are many of them—who would "writhe in their seats" at the sight of their meeting being turned into a "red-hot political rally," find out that nothing else than straight-out politics can come from the movement as now constituted, the better it will be for them.
