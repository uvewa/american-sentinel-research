The writer appeals to Baptists in the name of their historic struggle for freedom of conscience, in the name of the martyrs of that struggle, to be loyal to their own avowed principles of religious liberty, which principles are violated by the enactment and enforcement of religious legislation in the form of Sunday laws.

The persecutors of Baptists, the defenders of the Inquisition, and the bigots in all ages, have attempted to justify their persecutions on the ground that they were necessary for the "peace and good order of society." In the name of justice and consistency I plead with Baptists, Do not adopt the "civil-sabbath" excuse as a cloak to cover the sin and crime of enforcing religious conformity by law, and thus tacitly admit the claim of the persecutors of your fathers, that these persecutors were civil patriots while your fathers were society pests.

This appeal is made in the name of Christianity which teaches liberty of conscience, but which its enemies, because of the continual persecutions carried on in its name declare to be necessarily cruel to dissenters. This is an appeal to Baptists to demonstrate to all the world that a weak, persecuted church can become strong and still refuse to use that strength to persecute its dissenting brethren. The world is waiting for such a church.

The writer appeals to Baptists to remain true to their historic position on Church and State, and oppose the theocratic movement which to-day is crowding the halls of legislation, as in the days of Constantine, in quest of human power to support religious institutions, instead of appealing to the throne of grace. In the language of the Russian boy, I again appeal to you, "Send your petitions to the throne of God, and not to the Congress of the United States."

The writer appeals to Baptists to purge their garments of this modern Sunday-law persecution by withdrawing their influence from its instruments and agents, and by raising their voices against it. This is not an appeal for sympathy on behalf of imprisoned seventh-day observers. If their faith is not worth suffering for, it is not worth possessing. Their persecutors, not they, are the ones most in need of sympathy. They can afford to suffer, but Baptists cannot afford to persecute them, nor remain silent while others oppress them. Persecutions will come, but woe unto him by whom they come.

Men, whose boast it is that ye
Come of fathers brave and free,
If there breathes on earth a slave,
Are ye truly free and brave?
If you do not feel the chain
When it works a brother's pain,
Are ye not base slaves indeed—
Slaves unworthy to be freed?

* * * * *

Is true freedom but to break
Fetters for our own dear sake,
And with leathern hearts forget
That we owe mankind a debt?—
No; true freedom is to share
All the chains our brothers wear,
And, with heart and hand, to be
In earnest to make others free.

They are slaves who fear to speak
For the fallen and the weak;
They are slaves who will not choose
Hatred, scoffing, and abuse,
Rather than in silence shrink
From the truth they needs must think;
They are slaves who dare not be
In the right with two or three.

—James Russell Lowell.
