In his bull *Indeí Coetera*, issued May 4, 1494, Pope Alexander VI. gave South America to the kings of Spain and Portugal, on condition of establishing thereon the Catholic faith and seeing to the conversion of the Indians. In 1810, an independent constitution was drafted, somewhat on the type of the North American constitution. With regard to religious liberty, this constitution was a compromise between the spirit of the nineteenth century and the Catholic usages and prejudices of the people. It grants "every man living on the territory of the republic the right of exercising his religion." At the same time it declares that the president and vice-president "must belong to the Catholic, Apostolic and Roman confession," and states that "the nation protects, upholds and propagates the Catholic, Apostolic and Roman religion." Accordingly, the Catholic clergy are supported by the national funds, as are also convents, Catholic colleges and church edifices.

Until about ten years ago civil marriage did not exist, and one could be wedded only by submitting at the same time to the "sacrament" as administered by a priest or by Protestant ministers representing some European State church. It may surprise some readers to learn that the Methodist pastors in Buenos Ayres secured recognition by passing as ministers of the "United States State Church"!!

Civil marriage is now recognized in all parts of the republic. Still the law provides for divorce under no consideration. At the same time, many people enter as many illegal marriage relations as they please without being interfered with in the least.

The civil register has only been in existence for a few years, and that in just three provinces. In the other provinces citizenship is yet inseparably bound to the act of baptism performed by the Catholic priests, or by Protestant ministers recognized by the government. The baptismal certificate is the only document provided for by the law with which citizenship papers can be secured.

A lively fight is being kept up nevertheless against Jesuitism and intolerance by several secular papers. One Methodist lecturer in Buenos Ayres draws large congregations when speaking on anti-papal themes, and some leading men are avowedly in favor of the separation of Church and State.
