A Brooklyn clergyman, the Rev. E. H. Byington, the son of a missionary, is quoted by the N. Y. Tribune, as saying, "Give them equal equipments, training and opportunity, and I believe that a thousand Moslems will conquer a thousand Christians every time." What kind of Christians can this statement refer to?
