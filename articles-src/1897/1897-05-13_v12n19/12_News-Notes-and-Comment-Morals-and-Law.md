# News, Notes, and Comment.

A valued correspondent expresses himself as surprised and shocked at my calling Mr. Justice Blackstone a blunderer for imagining that law has something to do with morals. He demands with expressed grief, evidently mingled with some suppressed indignation, to know whether I do not recognize law "as the embodied expression of the moral sense of the community." We must start the answer with a definition.

* * *

"Morals" comes from a Latin word, *mos*, genitive, *moris*. The original, radical, etymological significance of *mos* is "manners" or "customs." Every title and every nation in the world has its own peculiar *mos*—that is to say, its body of manners, customs, usages. But among the lowest grades of savages, where society, properly speaking, does not exist, it is perfectly immaterial to the rest that now and then some individual arises who does not like any or all of the established methods of conduct, and chooses to behave himself in a fashion that is new and peculiar. He goes his way, and the others go theirs, and nobody is injured in the slightest. It is otherwise with more highly developed social organisms. To the intercourse of people composing these last—that is to say, to the very existence of the organism itself—uniformity of conduct under given circumstances, on the part of every constituent atom going to make up the whole is absolutely necessary. This necessity is at once the origin of human law, and its only justification. The organized whole is fighting for its life against the disintegrating tendencies of its parts, when it expresses its will in a law; it undertakes to extort compliance therewith by the exercise of its composite force, whenever necessary, and punishes, by virtue of that same force the open defiance of its will, when once expressed.

* * *

Thus we see that human law is properly and neatly described as "crystalized custom." And we also see that it has to do with manners, conduct, behavior, and nothing else. The "morality" of a people, if we understand by that term, their sense of public utility, their conception of what it is expedient that men should do, from a purely social standpoint, their ideas of the line of personal action which is best adapted to secure and promote the general welfare—this, indeed, their laws will always represent to some extent, at least. But this is not the morality of which my correspondent speaks, nor is it the morality which Mr. Justice Blackstone had in his mind when he spoke of "law"—meaning *human law*—as having "her seat in the bosom of God," and credited law—human law—with "prescribing what is right and prohibiting what is wrong."

* * *

For, with us, "morals" has gotten far away from its etymological significance. It is no longer essentially connected with manners, the sole business of human law. It has come to signify an internal condition, a mental state, a feeling, a sentiment, an emotion, call it what you will, which may or may not find expression in accordance with the requirements of human law, but which never depends in the slightest degree on human law, written or unwritten, common or statute, for its existence or its sanction. It has thus become a matter of individual experience and individual concern, and, being removed altogether from the world of matter to the world of mind, it has escaped forever from the jurisdiction, the cognizance, the dominion of human law.

* * *

There is no vain transcendentalism about all this, no useless, wandering, groping metaphysics or mysticism. Neither is there any covert preaching, or exhorting designedly concealed within it. The purpose is not to argue for right-doing, to extol morality, to make anybody esteem it a good thing who does not wish to esteem or follow it. The whole business is with a matter of definition. But definitions, be it observed, are the life of words, and it is only through words that the work of the intellect can be done. If the tools are not the right ones, the production is monstrous, and men are made to follow false lights, and to sail in rotten vessels on the ocean of thought.

* * *

Once we dissociate "morals" completely from *mos* or "manners," we prick the bubbles of many fads. The unspeakable absurdity of all attempts to legislate folks into righteousness becomes glaringly apparent. Nobody will maintain for an instant that it is possible even if it were advisable, to control the thoughts or minds of men by any system of legislation. It was formerly a notion, universally accepted, and acted on with calamitous results to the race, that certain opinions could be knocked, or racked, or burned out of people, and other opinions gotten into them, as substitutes, by similar processes. But this psychological theory is now discarded as hardly consistent with the facts. And that the soul, the mind, the intellect are beyond the reach of legal machinery is, with us, an axiom. If morality, then, in the modern sense, is a matter of internal state, as distinguished from a matter of external behavior, or conduct, law and morality in our day are and must remain entirely distinct and apart. For want of observing this distinction, Mr. Justice Blackstone permits himself to speak of law—*human law*, be it repeated—as something which commands what is right and prohibits what is wrong. Right and wrong, by whatever standard they may be discriminated, are things which belong to the domain of morals, and have nothing whatever to do with manners, except in so far as good manners follow from good morals. It may be true that the first always follows from the last; but it is certainly true that manners of a high and practically perfect kind may exist, and do, in fact, very often exist without a perceptible trace of genuine morality. Many put on good manners, out of deference to the law of the State; they put them on out of deference to the laws of society, for the reason that they want to "get along" in the world. They do right for fear of legal and of social penalties. They obey the civil law, and the laws or customs of polite intercourse for what there is in it. Such persons are good citizens, and law-abiding, but such are not moral.

* * *

There has never yet been a State or country whose laws, sometime or other, have not forbidden what was right, and commanded what was wrong. The history of Mr. Justice Blackstone's own country has been repeatedly stained, at no great intervals of time, with legislation of the vilest character. Some of the greatest infamies ever embodied in human law were upon the statute book when that distinguished commentator delivered those famous lectures of his. He did not disdain to trifle with his own conscience, and tamper with the moral welfare of his pupils' souls, by pitiful special pleading in behalf of such Acts of Parliament, and by the shabbiest Charlatanism of logic, to disguise their true inspiration and purpose. But he is still very highly recommended to the admiration and confidence of American youth in many law schools.

* * *

The object of law—however wildly and disastrously for the race it often blunders in reaching out after the same—is to make good citizens. The business of morality is to make good men. The difference between the good citizen in his relation to law, and the good man, as the product of morality, may be well compared to the difference between a gentleman and a genteel man. The gentleman behaves as such under the influence of an inward monitor, whose orders find expression in his course of life. He is not gentlemanly because it pays. He is just as much a gentleman when he is alone in the forest, "far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife," as when he is in the church, the forum, the political meeting, the reception parlor. He is good-mannered, if you choose, at heart. But it is by no means so with the man who is merely genteel. Perfect gentility has frequently been found associated with almost total depravity. Fine ball-room behavior, elaborate courtesy on the bustling thoroughfare, the street car, the railway, the steamboat, at the home and the office—these are practiced by hundreds who not only care nothing for what they should express, but actually make themselves adepts in such matters for the express purpose of accomplishing nefarious schemes. They are perfectly genteel, and at the same time, perfectly villainous. They are the creatures of law. Only morality can change them for the better.
