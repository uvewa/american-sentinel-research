Rev. Dr. Newman Smith, of New Haven, Connecticut, "startled" his congregation by refusing to read the Governor's proclamation appointing "Good Friday" as a day of fasting. He explained that he refused to do so because the day was already hallowed by a higher authority than the chief executive of his State.

I am not concerned with the aspect of Good Friday, as "hallowed" or otherwise, in making these notes. To each his own "sacred day," or days. But I am always surprised anew when I find State intermeddling in religious matters of this sort going unrebuked, and its occasional repudiation "startling" people in this latter part of the nineteenth century of "Christian civilization." Why, the startling thing about this audacious proceeding among us "free" Americans is that any executive, Federal or State, should dream of undertaking it—should dare to undertake it. What is this act of "setting apart" a day for either thanksgiving or fasting but an impertinent invasion by the civil power where religion alone has place? What is it but an attempt of President or governor to play the part of pope? Who made either of them a judge or a ruler over the people, that either ventures to decide for us whether it is good to give thanks, or to go without food at any time, and what are they who presume to fix a time when others are to do these things? Thomas Jefferson, clear-sighted, sincere, true-hearted man that he was, steered clear of this affront to his fellows, this transcendent absurdity. Grover Cleveland out-Heroded Herod in his last Thanksgiving proclamation. A portion of that extraordinary document was rather in the nature of a dogmatical exposition of the True Faith, such as, in the Roman Catholic Church, not even a pope can utter, but which needs, for its proper formulation, the solemn process of Ecumenical Council.
