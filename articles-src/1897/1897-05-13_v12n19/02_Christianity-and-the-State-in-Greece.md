A correspondent of the New York Herald, who is reporting the proceedings in the war between Turkey and Greece, relates that at a village named Koniskos, a large body of Greek enthusiasts who were on the point of making an advance into Macedonian territory, observed a "solemn" service, in which they all partook of the sacrament and registered the oath "Liberty or death." Upon their caps was the motto "In this [sign] victory," in evident allusion to the famous motto of Constantine, derived from his alleged vision of the cross in the sky, upon one of his expeditions of conquest. To the Greeks all this was a matter of the utmost seriousness. They had not a doubt but that they were engaged in the performance of the duties and ordinances of Christianity.

That this is so is still further apparent from the proclamation which they issued, as follows:

"Brothers and soldiers of Christ and liberty! We hoist the flag of liberty for the Greek countries. Under its shadow let us unite, having as a watchword, 'Liberty or death!' The justice of our cause is recognized by all free people. Blest by God, let us push onward. Brother Greeks, God is with us?"

They pushed forward,—not to victory, but to defeat, at the hands of the unchristian Turks. The "soldiers of Christ" were routed by the forces of the Sultan! Antichrist proved stronger than Christianity!

To us, the error of all this is plainly apparent; but in it the Greeks are only illustrating the logical results of the doctrine that religion and the State can properly be united. The Greeks are fighting the battles of their State, but not the battles of Christianity; yet if Christianity and the State can be united, the cause of one becomes the cause of the other, and he who shoulders his gun and goes forth to fight for the State, may properly be considered as becoming thereby a "soldier of Christ." It should be apparent to all Christians at least that Christianity cannot be joined with the State.

Is it any worse to slaughter people with bullet and sword, after the fashion of the pagan, than to kill them slowly by methods which are devised to satisfy the selfish greed of gold-loving "Christians"? Is there any less guilt lying at the door of commercial greed than at that of the Turk?
