PARIS—novelty-seeking Paris—has a novelty at last which it is to be hoped will supply all the demand in that line for a long time to come. A noteworthy feature of the terrible calamity which has plunged all Europe into mourning, is the fact, as related in the *New York Herald*, that an unusual number of people filled the Charity Bazaar on the fateful afternoon, because of the presence of the papal nuncio, Mgr. Clari, who had come to pronounce his blessing upon the enterprize. It was just after the papal blessing had been pronounced, and the nuncio had taken his departure, that death, in a whirlwind of flame, blotted the enterprise, and scores of those engaged in it, out of existence. A terrible illustration this of the amount of protection that can be conferred by the papal blessing.
