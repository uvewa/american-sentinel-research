A religious exchange makes the following truthful observations relative to the perpetuity of the Creation Sabbath:—

"Commenting on the first four words of the fourth commandment of the Decalogue, as given at Sinai: 'Remember the Sabbath day,' Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown, in their critical commentary, remark that these words imply that the Sabbath 'was already known and recognized as a season of sacred rest.' And so it was, as the Scriptures abundantly prove.

"It was known in the wilderness of sin thirty days before the children of Israel reached Sinai. This is shown from Exodus 16. It was known and observed by a line of godly men reaching all the way back to creation, when God made the Sabbath and gave it to man. And it has likewise been known and observed by a line of godly people ever since Sinai,—by the Israelites, by Christ, by the apostles, by the early Christians, by the Abyssinians, by the Waldenses, by the Seventh-day Baptists, and last of all, by the Christian denomination known as Seventh-day Adventists, a people who observe this most ancient of God's landmarks, and are looking for the near advent of the Saviour of mankind.

"And to take a step into the future, Isaiah 66:22, 23 shows that it will be known and observed in the blessed new earth which the Lord is going to make. How consistent, then, that it should be kept by Christians now when on the very borders of the eternal world! God in a special manner gave His people the Sabbath shortly before bringing them into the promised land of Canaan, and so He is again in a special manner restoring it to His people just before He takes them into the great antitypical promised land."
