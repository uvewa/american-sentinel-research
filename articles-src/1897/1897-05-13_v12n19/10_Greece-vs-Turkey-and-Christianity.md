How much would be gained by Christianity if Christendom should, sword in hand, take the side of the Greeks against the Turks, as is so generally advocated, even by clergymen, that she should? Mr. Frederick L. Chapman says on this point in the April issue of Our Day:—

"The Orthodox Greek church has never been friendly to the evangelical faith; it meets the apostle of the primitive gospel in a spirit of haughty arrogance, and self-satisfied conceit; it recognizes no necessity for betterment in the religious life of people who pay their vows and their tithes in the established church. This spirit is not consistent with progress, with education, or with a spiritual religion. We regret that we must express the conviction that in the event of the triumph of Greece over Turkey, Christian missions in Asia Minor will find a more intolerant atmosphere there than has beset them even under Turkish rule. The torch of arson may not be applied to their buildings, to their churches and colleges, but icebergs in the form of orthodox sanctuaries will arise in the midst and the coldness emanating from these will be apt to freeze the life out of a struggling Christian community."

The worst enemy of Christianity is not the fiery enemy, but the cold enemy of common worldliness.
