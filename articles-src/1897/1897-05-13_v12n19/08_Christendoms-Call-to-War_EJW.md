It seems as though Christendom were becoming intoxicated with the spirit of vengeance, so that the most peaceably inclined men have lost their senses. One religious paper reprints some floating newspaper stories derogatory to the character of Turks in general, and then exclaims editorially,—

"Ought such a nation to be tolerated for a moment on the face of the earth?"

and that but expresses the general sentiment among preachers and people.

Just analyze this: "Ought such a nation to be tolerated for a moment on the face of the earth?" is the same as, "Ought such people to be tolerated for a moment on the face of the earth?" and that includes thousands of individuals, of each of whom it is virtually said, "Ought such a person to be tolerated for a moment on the face of the earth?" That is to say, the spirit of intolerance is already so firmly rooted in the hearts of professed Christians, that they do not wish to tolerate for a moment the existence of those whom they, taking the throne of judgment, have decided to be unfit to live. What is that but charging God with laxness in the discharge of his duty, because he suffers wicked men to live?

How different from the Spirit of Christ! When he was rejected by the Samaritans, and two disciples wished to command fire to come down and consume the inhospitable people, he rebuked them, saying, "Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of. For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them." Luke 9:51-56. The spirit of desiring to be the instruments of God's vengeance has always been more prominent than the desire to be instruments of his mercy, and when it is once cherished it inevitably results in getting ahead of the Lord, and being both judge and executioner.

## THE TRUE CHRISTIAN SPIRIT.

But we have a still stronger rebuke of this bitter, warlike spirit. When Jesus had been betrayed into the hands of his enemies, and a mob of men came to seize him and put him to death, Peter drew a sword in his defense. The blow just missed the head of one of the gang of murderers, and cut off his ear. "Then said Jesus to him, Put up again thy sword into his place; for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword." Matt. 26:51, 52. And then, as an evidence that he came not to take life but to save it, Jesus healed his wounded enemy. Luke 22:50, 51.

If there was ever a time when it was right to resist oppression and injustice, it was then. Jesus was innocent, as even his judges declared. Here was the worst kind of religious persecution. Every indignity, insult, and outrage was heaped upon Jesus, yet he opened not his mouth, and forbade his followers to fight in his defense. How then can any of his followers fight in defense of themselves, or even of their brethren who are persecuted? The disciple is not greater than his Lord.

Peter was well-meaning and sincere in his defense of the Lord, and so would we fain believe are those who now counsel drawing the sword in behalf of the Armenians. But Peter did not then know the Spirit of the Gospel. He was not converted, and within a few hours after his impulsive defense he denied that he knew the Lord. His example is not one to be followed by disciples of Christ. When he became converted, he learned to know the Lord.

Christians are called to follow Christ's example, and to suffer unjustly, without complaining, much less resisting; yet all over the world professed Christians are denying this calling. Why is it?—It is because a spirit, not from the Lord, is seeking to drive them to destruction, for Jesus said, "All they that take the sword shall perish with the sword." If Satan can only succeed in filling Christians with such zeal for any cause whatever, no matter how worthy, that they will fight for it, he knows that their destruction is sure.

Mark the word "all." There is no exception. "All they that take the sword shall perish with the sword." It makes no difference who handles it. The sword vigorously wielded by the hands of professed Christians will work as much havoc and destruction as in the hands of infidels, as history abundantly proves. The fact that a man calls himself a Christian, does not make it any more a righteous deed for him to cleave another man's head with the sword, than it would be if a Turk did the same thing.

## THE GOSPEL IS FOR ALL.

In prophetic vision the Apostle John saw "a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people and tongues," standing before the throne of God, clothed with white robes, and bearing palms of victory over sin and Satan. Rev. 7:9. That is positive evidence that there will be Turks in heaven. Yet one would not gather from reading the religious press, that there was any possibility of salvation for a Turk. It may be said that the Turks are bitterly prejudiced against Christianity. That is true, and who could expect it to be otherwise? Christianity is to them embodied in the boasted "Christian nations" of Europe, and few of these have ever done anything to recommend the name. But that is not all. Those religious bodies, professing to be Christian, of which the Turks have most knowledge, are the Greek and Armenian churches, and in one important particular the Mohammedan has good reason to believe that his religion is superior to theirs; for he sees the members of those bodies bowing down to and adoring images and pictures, while the Mohammedan abominates the worship of idols. But even this is not the worst. From the time of the crusades, professed Christians as a rule have regarded the Turks with lofty contempt, as beings to be execrated and driven off; now, all Christendom is ringing with unchristian cries for vengeance upon the Turks, and even their utter extermination. Can it be wondered at that the Turks are not drawn towards Christianity, or that they are suspicious of foreigners? But when the just Judge of all the earth punishes the Turks for their misdeeds, who dare say that none of their blood will be upon the garments of those who bear the name of Christian? We appeal to individual Christians to clear themselves, by being Christlike in their words and acts, from all responsibility for Turkish indifference to Christianity.

## THE GREAT DECEPTION.

There is a cause for this present cry against the Turks. That it is not caused by the spirit of Christ, needs no argument. What spirit it is that is even now working, may be seen by remembering what it is desired to do with the Turks. The least thing that is demanded, is that they be driven from Europe. Such atrocities, it is said, ought not to be allowed on European soil. But will they be any better on Asiatic soil?—Certainly not. Then what would necessarily be the next step after driving them from Europe—manifestly, to drive them from Asia, that is, from the earth, so far at least as their existence as a nation is concerned. This is even now demanded. Their overthrow will be the last act in the scheme to place the world under the dominion of the so-called Christian powers, thus to fulfil the dreams of a temporal millennium, in which so many have indulged. But each one of these "Christian Powers" will wish to have the supremacy, and so the armies of all will be assembled in Palestine, the center of the Sultan's Asiatic dominion,—when the last struggle takes place. That gathering is thus described in prophecy:—

"And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, for they are the spirits of devils working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. . . . And he [they] gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon." Rev. 16:13-16.

Here we are plainly told what spirit brings the kings of the earth together at that place. The deception we see working even now; for that Christendom is being deceived is painfully evident. If men were not already grossly deceived, how could they in the name of Christ counsel war? How could they so misrepresent true Christianity before the world as to claim that the blood even of martyrs demands revenge by the sword? Is it not a terrible deception that is even now closing in upon the world? What an awful thought, that every man, be he minister of the gospel or not, who is upbraiding the Powers for not coercing the Turks, is simply an unconscious agent of Satan to gather the kings of earth to that great battle which is to result in the ruin of all. God grant that many who have thoughtlessly been led away by popular clamor, may recover themselves from the snare of the devil before it is too late, and show to the world, including the Turks, that Christianity means to be like Christ. We have full faith that this prayer will be answered.
