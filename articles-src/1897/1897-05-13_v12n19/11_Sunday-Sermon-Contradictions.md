THE Cleveland Recorder, of April 5, prints a synopsis of a sermon delivered by a clergyman of that city, in which it is stated that, "It is an accepted truth that a man needs one day in seven for rest," etc. The same paper gave also a synopsis of another sermon delivered the same evening by another clergyman of the city, which asserts with equal positiveness that "Those preachers who say that the Sabbath is to be observed because man's infirmities demand time for repairing, are taking a wrong view of the question. They are not true to their calling. They make the law of heaven subordinate to the law of the State."

Both these sermons were delivered in defense of the Sunday sabbath. They give an illustration of the harmony that exists in the camp of error.
