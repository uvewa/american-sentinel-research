In the April issue of the *Nineteenth Century* appears an article on "How I Became Pope," which is extracted from the autobiographical commentaries of Pius the Second. History refers to the latter as a person of no small literary ability, which appeared in his authorship of society verse, novelettes, and books of history and travels. Of the circumstances which attended the casting of the vote which elevated him to the pontifical throne, he says:—

"We adjourned to luncheon, and from that moment, what cabals! The more powerful members of the college, whether their strength lay in reputation or wealth, beckoned others to their side. They promised, they threatened. They were even some who without a blush, without a shred of modesty, pleaded their own merits, and demanded the supreme pontificate qualifications. . . . Each man boasted of his qualifications. The bickering of these claimants was something extraordinary; through a day and a sleepless night it raged with unabated virulence."

Such is the testimony of the pope himself as to the character of the proceedings which resulted in the elevation of Pius II. before Christendom as the supreme visible head of the Christian church. But the cause of Christ knows nothing of intrigue.
