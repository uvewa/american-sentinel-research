The Elizabeth (New Jersey) News, of March 18, prints a sermon delivered by "Father" James H. Brady, curate of St. Mary's Church of Elizabeth, delivered March 14, from which we quote the following:—

"Right here it is necessary for me to remind you that the day which you observe as Catholic Christians, and in fact which all others who claim to be Christians do observe, is not the same day which is spoken of in this third commandment. If you look to the Bible as an authority for the observance of the day you will not find it. The Sabbath day spoken of in the Book of Exodus or in the Book of Deuteronomy, as well as the word "Sabbath," mentioned in the New Testament, has relation to the seventh day in the week and not to the first.

"It is well to remind the Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists, and all other Christians outside of the pale of Mother Church that the Bible, the only authority which they recognize in matters of religion, does not support them anywhere in the observance of the Christian day, namely, Sunday. For them to call Sunday the Sabbath and speak of 'Sabbath school,' is arrant nonsense. The Seventh-day Baptists are the only ones who properly employ the term Sabbath, because they also observe the seventh and not the first day of the week as the day of rest.

"The Christian Sunday is an institution of the Roman Catholic church, and those who observe the day observe a commandment of the Catholic church, and thus indirectly acknowledge the authority of that church to legislate in the name of God in all religious matters and her superiority over the Bible. For those who believe in the divine authority of the church the observance of Sunday is but natural. Those, however, who otherwise refuse to acknowledge the authority of the Catholic church and yet observe Sunday and regard it as a Sabbath are foolishly inconsistent."

Our Sunday-keeping brethren sometimes grow impatient when these oft-repeated statements of Roman Catholics are brought to their attention. They say, because Roman Catholics assert that to keep Sunday is to "indirectly acknowledge the authority of that church to legislate in the name of God," does not make it so. This is quite true. But the assertion is supported by the following facts:—

1. The Bible says, the "seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God."
2. It nowhere says the first day is the Sabbath.
3. With the Protestant the Bible is the sole and only authority.
4. The Bible furnishes no authority for the sanctification of the first day and the desecration of the seventh day.
5. The Roman Catholic church professes to furnish this authority on the ground of "her superiority over the Bible."

When Protestants therefore desecrate the Sabbath day contrary to the command of God, and in harmony with the command of the Roman Catholic church, whose authority do they really acknowledge? They may assert that they do not acknowledge the authority of the Roman Catholic church, but whose authority do they acknowledge?

It will not do to assert that the change from the seventh to the first day occurred before the Roman Catholic church came into existence. The principles of the papacy were manifesting themselves in Paul's day, for he declared "the mystery of iniquity doth already work."

There are some Protestants of prominence who admit the absence of a scriptural command for Sunday observance.

"Binney's Theological Compend," published by the Methodist Book Concern, of this city, has this to say on this point:—

"This law [ten commandments] is spiritual and perfect, extending to all the inward creations and outward acts of men, and can never be changed or annulled."—P. 153.

"The seventh-day Sabbath was strictly observed by Christ and his apostles previous to his resurrection."—P. 170.

"Jesus, after his resurrection, changed the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the week."—P. 171.

"When Jesus gave instruction for this change, we are not told, but likely during the time when he spoke to his apostles of the things pertaining to his kingdom. Acts 1:3. This is probably one of the many unrecorded things which Jesus did."—P. 171.

The reader will observe that this is the ground on which the Roman Catholic rests prayers for the dead, adoration of saints, purgatory, etc., etc. When asked to furnish a command of the Lord for these practices, the answer is made that the Lord instructed his church concerning these things, and consequently it was not necessary to record them in the Bible; they come to us by tradition. This is the separating line between the Protestant and the Catholic.

Here is another frank acknowledgment from a prominent member of the Protestant Episcopal church:—

"There are some points of great difficulty respecting the fourth commandment. . . .

"In the first place we are commanded to keep holy the seventh day; but yet we do not think it necessary to keep the seventh day holy; for the seventh day is Saturday. It may be said that we keep the first day instead; but surely this is not the same thing; the first day cannot be the seventh day; and where are we told in Scripture that we are to keep the first day at all? We are commanded to keep the seventh; but we are nowhere commanded to keep the first day. There is another difficulty on this subject: We Christians in considering each of the ten commandmdnts, turn to what our Lord says in explanation of them; for in the sermon on the mount he says, that 'not one jot or tittle' of the law shall fail; that he has come 'not to destroy but to fulfill' the law: and then he shows in the instance of the sixth, seventh, and third commandments, how he will require them to be fulfilled by Christians, not in the letter only, but in the spirit, the heart, and thought.

"The reason why we keep the first day of the week holy instead of the seventh is for the same reason that we observe many other things, not because the Bible, but because the Church has enjoined it."*

Here is another from a Baptist clergyman:—

"There was and is a commandment to keep holy the Sabbath day, but that Sabbath day is not Sunday. It will, however, be readily said, with some show of triumph, that the Sabbath was transferred from the seventh to the first day of the week, with all its duties, privileges, and sanctions. Earnestly desiring information on this subject, which I have studied for so many years, I ask, Where can the record of such a transaction be found?—Not in the New Testament,—absolutely not. There is no scriptural evidence of the change of the Sabbath institution from the seventh to the first day of the week."

"Of course I quite well know that Sunday did come into use in early Christian history as a religious day, as we learn from the Christian fathers and other sources. But what a pity it comes branded with the mark of paganism and christened with the name of the sun-god, when adopted and sanctified by the papal apostasy, and bequeathed as a sacred legacy to Protestantism and the Christian world!"—From a paper read by Dr. Hiscox, before the Baptist Pastors' Conference, New York City, Nov. 5, 1893.

In the face of all this is it not at least dangerous to try to compel by civil law a Seventh-day Adventist or Baptist to observe the first day of the week? Seventh-day Adventists believe that in observing Sunday men dishonor God and do honor to the papacy. Before this can be denied it must be shown from Scripture that God has removed his blessing from the seventh-day Sabbath and given men permission to desecrate it; that He has revoked his permission to men to work on that day and commanded them to keep it holy. Where are these commands?
