The following is part of an editorial paragraph appearing in the N. Y. Independent, of May 6:—

"A clergyman writes us to ask if it would be in violation of the neutrality laws for individuals to present money to King George for the support of his war against the Turk. He believes that 'the fame of Greece at Marathon, in heaven's eyes, has been eclipsed by her fame at Reveni Pass,' and that it is 'a service to the extension of the kingdom of Christ as much to send just now rifles and ammunition to Greece as it is to send Bibles and hymn books to the Congo.' He wants himself to send money enough to buy a few bullets; and he does not believe 'that it would be wrong to pray that if it be God's will each one of them might be an instrument for righteousness.'

And this clergyman professes to stand before the people as the representative of Him whose doctrine is, "Love your enemies." If the general sentiment of Christendom were not grossly perverted on this point from the teaching of the gospel, would it be possible for a Christian clergyman seriously to give utterance to such utterly heathen sentiments in the name of Christianity?
