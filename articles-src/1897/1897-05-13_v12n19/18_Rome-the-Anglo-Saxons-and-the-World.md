From "Present Truth," London, Eng.

In the Catholic Times, of April 9, the Rev. William Barry, D. D. tells the reason why the authorities of the Roman Catholic church gave permission not only to the laity, but also to the younger clergy, to attend the English universities. He says:—

"It was felt that if we aimed at a wide diffusion of our principles and doctrines among the cultivated classes, we could not any more stand aloof from them; we must take our place in English society, gain some experience of the men whom we desired to influence, and no longer stay within the intrenchments that, most serviceable or necessary in their day, had still kept us at a distance from the social life of our fellow countrymen."

A little further on in the same article comes the following frank and bold statement of Rome's aims and hopes with regard to England:—

"There are at least one hundred millions of people who speak the English tongue; some three hundred millions more fall under their influence; almost a third of the earth's surface lies within the English sphere; and, as we are proud of reminding one another, 'Britannia rules the waves.' In a letter which is now lying before me, signed by one of the most eminent dignitaries in Christendom, I find the conviction set down that 'the English-speaking nations will dominate the world, and that if the Church is to exercise her proper sway in gaining the ear and the heart of the English and American people, her supremacy will be secured.' Impressive words, which carry with them a high privilege and a momentous duty!

"Instead of the Imperial Romans, whom Christianity made its own fifteen hundred years ago, have come the world-subduing Britons. Their genius, literature, laws and methods are peculiar to themselves, yet have not a little in common with the mediaeval spirit, while they furnish an amazing contrast to the despotic, centralising, pseudo classical, and altogether illiberal administration of modern States abroad. Rome, as it appeared to me, might well stretch out a hand to England across the deadly Napoleonic régime that, by the confession of men like M. Taine, is strangling the life out of France and Italy.

"The very fact that Leo XIII. had recognized through his legate in America the free Constitution of the United States with eulogy and admiration, was to me a proof of the kinship between the old English and the Catholic way of dealing with men. Could there be anything more desirable than to encourage a genuine understanding between these two powers, one the supreme spiritual power, the other as truly progressive as conservative, and both alike opposed to anarchic revolution no less than to bureaucratic despotism? England was beginning to recover the elements of the Catholic religion; she had turned her feet into a pathway at the end of which was the apostles' shrine. Could not Rome hasten forth to meet her?"

The fact that Rome's agents speak out so plainly is very significant, showing that she is now sure of her ground.
