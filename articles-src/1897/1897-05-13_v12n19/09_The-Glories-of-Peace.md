The following words from a recent sermon by the Rev. Dr. Hillis, of Chicago, are peculiarly appropriate at a time when the spirit of war is spreading death and desolation, and arraying the "Christian" powers of earth against each other, as is seen to-day:—

"The disciples experienced the horrors of the dungeon, the thumb-screw and the fagot. Becoming fiendish in cruelty, Nero clothed the Christians in garments dipped in pitch and tar, and used their blazing forms for lighting up his garden party. Outraged and threatened with extermination, the disciples bethought themselves of swords and shields.

"How could they live in peace with their destroyers? Instinct whispered, 'Defend thyself!' Self-interest said: 'Meet storm with storm, and stroke with stroke.' But in the moment when persecution was fiercest, Paul urged non-resistance. He bade the disciples meet the spy with pity, meet the jailer with gentleness, meet the executioner with forgiveness, thus heaping coals of fire upon the head of each enemy.

"In that hour the persecutor made sharp his sword, and Nero starved his lions to-day, that to-morrow the beasts might be the fiercer for human blood. When all was ready the murderers leaped upon the unresisting disciples. Then, indeed, did Christ's disciples go forth as sheep 'midst wolves. Then did the dove go forth to conquer the eagle and hawk. Having pledged universal conquest to these sons of gentleness, Christ sent his peacemakers forth 'midst all the thunder of universal battle.

"Paradoxical, indeed, Christ's principles of right living. 'Abhor that which is evil, yet love the evil-doer; live peaceably with friends, yet maintain peace with enemies.' What unique contradiction meets us here!

"History tells us of a Roman soldier who was condemned to beasts in the Coliseum. When the lion sprang into the arena, it stopped, startled by the voice of the soldier. A moment later the lion was crawling at the prisoner's feet and licking his hands. The event proved that once, while passing through the African forest, this soldier chanced upon a lion suffering from a thorn that had passed through the foot. By extracting the thorn he made the wild beast to be his friend and a pet, only to meet the lion years later in the arena.

"Strange, indeed, would it be if this story were true, yet less strange than that such a man as the beloved disciple, John, should by his gentleness, extract the fangs of cruelty from a Nero or a Domitian—monsters, these, who exceeded untamed lions in fierceness. Yet good men and true are commanded to maintain peace with all men, while also maintaining an uncompromising hostility against every form of iniquity.

"But how can Moses, heir to the throne of Egypt, abhor the cruelties perpetrated upon his enslaved brethren and yet live peaceably with the tyrants who abused those he loves? How can David, dodging the javelin that Saul hurled, hunted like a partridge upon the mountains before the cruel king, live at peace with the tyrant who pursued him? How can Paul live peaceably with the mob at Ephesus, who stoned the scholar through the streets and left him half dead by the wayside?

"And yet, if Christ abhorred sin and breathed forth words that were like flames of fire consuming men's iniquities, he also maintained peace with Judas, who betrayed his master, and with Pilate, who tortured the man in whom he said he found no fault. Leaving this word, 'Blessed are the peacemakers,' as a watchword for his disciples, Christ sent them forth to war against iniquity, indeed, but also to live peaceably with the transgressor, whose sins they must needs destroy. And if we recall the early conflict of Christianity with heathenism, and review the story how it conquered the Roman world, we shall find that the disciples achieved their victory because they were peacemakers and peace lovers. It has been said that each persecuted Christian by his courage and Christian spirit conquered his own jailer and executioner.

"Full eighteen centuries have passed, and once more has come an era when peacemakers are despised, and physical force is enthroned. So far is mankind from believing in peacemaking that England's motto is not the lamb, but the lion, and America's banner is emblazoned not with the dove, but with the eagle, with its beak and talons, while Russia's symbol is still the bear.

"The foreign nations, whose harbors are crowded with torpedo-boats and warships, whose strongholds bristle with cannons—these nations that stand over against each other like armed fortresses, and to-morrow may cause Europe to tremble with the march of armed men—these peoples exhibit anything save a belief in social progress through peace loving and peacemaking.

To-day the world believes that progress rides forward upon a powder cart. The angel's song of 'Peace on Earth,' has given place to the song of the bombshell and the shriek of the cannon ball. If the sword has fallen from man's hand, it is that it may be replaced with the pistol."

The world will never direct its forces by the maxim, "Love your enemies"; it will never know the victory that peace wins by non-resistance. The "British lion" will never become a lamb, or the "American eagle" a dove. But every person who believes on Jesus Christ is called to a life of peace,—a peace which the world may wonder at but not understand. The exhortation to them is, "Let the peace of God rule in your hearts." If all who name the name of Prince of Peace would but do this, more would be done in a day for the cause of peace in the earth than will ever be accomplished by all the "peace societies" to the end of time.
