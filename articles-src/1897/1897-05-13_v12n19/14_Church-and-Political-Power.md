It is an unfortunate statement of truth that is made by the president of the Portland (Oregon) branch of the "National Municipal League," in the following:—

"The church membership and following is sufficiently numerous to impose its united will upon any political or municipal party in any city of the United States. It could, if united and determined, set up a political or a municipal ideal and compel politicians of every party to conform to it."

The unfortunate thing about it is that the "church membership and following" are being wheeled into line to accomplish this very thing.
