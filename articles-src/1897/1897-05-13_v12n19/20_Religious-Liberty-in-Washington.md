"Absolute freedom of conscience in all matters of religious sentiment, belief, and worship, shall be guaranteed to every individual, and no one shall be molested or disturbed in person or property, on account of religion; but the liberty of conscience hereby secured shall not be so construed as to excuse acts of licentiousness, or justify practices inconsistent with the peace and safety of the State. No public money or property shall be appropriated for, or applied to, religious establishment. No religious qualification shall be required for any public office or employment, nor shall any person be incompetent as a witness or juror, in consequence of his opinion on matters of religion, nor be questioned in any court of justice touching his religious belief to affect the weight of his testimony." So reads Section 11 of Article 1 of the "Declaration of Rights," of the constitution of the State of Washington (ratified 1889).

Again, we read from Article 26, the "Compact With the United States":—

"First, That perfect toleration of religious sentiment shall be secured, and that no inhabitant of this State shall ever be molested in person or property on account of his or her mode of religious worship."

These articles would seem to give to every person in this State freedom to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience; but though their language is so plain, there are some who are deprived of the liberty granted them under this constitution, as the following will show:—

"At 11:30 o'clock last night the agreement was reached; and under instructions from the court a sealed verdict was permitted and the jurors were allowed to go home. . . . At 9 o'clock this morning they were again brought into court, when a call of the jury developed that one of the jurymen was missing. This juror was D. A. Webb, a devout Seventh-day Adventist, who last night had asked to be excused until Monday before the verdict had been received and whose request was refused. In ascertaining who was missing, the court sent the sheriff after him and dismissed the jury.

"In a short time Deputy Sheriff McClelland located the missing juror at Sabbath-school and brought him to the court. Then the verdict of the jury was announced. . . . The result of the jury's findings was not near so interesting to the audience by this time as what the court would do with the recalcitrant juryman. The suspense was not of any length, however, for as soon as the clerk had read the verdict, the court asked Mr. Webb what excuse he had to offer for his action in not reporting with the rest of the jury. The juryman replied: 'The Constitution of the United States allows every man to worship in any manner he sees fit.' That was as far as he got.

The court took a hand then, and said: 'The Constitution of the United States and the laws of this State say that you are fined $5, and you will be committed until it is paid. Mr. Sheriff, take charge of this man.'

"Mr. Webb started a long speech, in which he quoted Scripture liberally, but the court tired in short order, and Mr. Webb was taken under the care of the sheriff and locked up in the County Jail. Mr. Webb was under restraint about three quarters of an hour, when some of his friends called on the sheriff and deposited the amount of the fine. The juryman would not himself pay it, saying to do so would be inconsistent with the stand he had taken and with his religious convictions."

This is taken from the *Daily Olympian*, of April 24, last. Mr. Webb was summoned to appear on the jury April 13; he appeared as requested, and begged Judge Ayre to excuse him from the jury altogether, as he kept the seventh day, and could not act on that day. The judge said, "You can act until that time, then you will be excused." The first Friday came, and a few hours before the Sabbath began the judge said, "Mr. Webb, you are excused." The next week Judge Jacobs, from Seattle, acted in Judge Ayre's place.

When the Sabbath hours were drawing nigh, Mr. W. presented his request to the judge to be excused from serving on the jury during the hours of his day of worship. This the judge would not grant. Mr. Webb, with rest of the jurymen, was locked up in the jury-room until 11:30 Friday evening. When they were dismissed Mr. W. told them he would not appear again on Sabbath morning; but on Sabbath morning the sheriff came after him and took him from the church, where he had met with others of like faith to worship his God. (Is that the liberty that the constitution of the State of Washington grants, without any hearing more than is stated above?)

When Judge Jacobs imposed the fine of $5 and ordered Mr. Webb committed until the fine was paid, Mr. Webb asked for a few minutes to give a reason for his action. So he began by reading, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy; six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it." The judge then interrupted by saying, "Sheriff, take this man and lock him up; we want no long sermons."

Mr. Webb was then locked up as stated; but a lawyer, Mr. Falkner, paid the fine of his own accord, and Mr. Webb was then set at liberty.

But where is the justice in such treatment at the hands of those that are claiming to mete out justice to the people? Truly, the Lord says: "And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter. Yea, truth falleth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey: and the Lord saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment."
