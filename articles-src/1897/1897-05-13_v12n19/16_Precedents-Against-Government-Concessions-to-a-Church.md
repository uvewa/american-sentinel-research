Editor American Sentinel: Please put on record in your valuable paper the following from the Veto Messages of the Presidents of the United States.

February 21, 1811, President James Madison sent to the House of Representatives the following veto:—

"Having examined and considered the bill entitled 'An Act incorporating the Protestant Episcopal church in the town of Alexandria, in the District of Columbia, I now return the bill to the House of Representatives, in which it originated, with the following objections:—

"Because the bill exceeds the rightful authority to which governments are limited by the essential distinction between civil and religious functions, and violates in particular the article of the Constitution of the United States, which declares that 'Congress shall make no law respecting a religious establishment.' This bill enacts into and establishes by law sundry rules and proceedings relative purely to the organization and policy of the church incorporated. . . . This particular church, therefore, would so far be a religious establishment by law, a legal force and sanction being given to certain articles in its constitution and administration. . . . Because the bill vests in the said incorporated church an authority to provide for the support of the poor and the education of poor children of the same; an authority which, being altogether superfluous, if provision is to be the result of pious charity, would be a precedent for giving to religious societies as such, a legal agency in carrying into effect a public and civil duty.

"JAMES MADISON."

February 23, 1811, the above veto message was sustained by the House by a vote of 74 to 29 (see "Veto Messages," page 11).

February 28, 1811, the President sent to the House the following veto:—

"Having examined and considered the bill entitled 'An Act for the relief of Richard Ferom, William Coleman, Robert Lewis, Samuel Mimms, Joseph Wilson, and the Baptist church at Salem meeting house in the Mississippi territory,' I now return the same to the House of Representatives in which it originated, with the following objections:—

"Because the bill, in reserving a certain parcel of land of the United States for the use of said Baptist church, comprises a principle and precedent for the appropriation of funds of the United States for the use and support of religious societies, contrary to the article of the Constitution which declares that Congress shall make no law respecting a religious establishment.

"JAMES MADISON."

March 3, 1811, the House sustained the President's veto by a vote of 55 to 33.

In view of these precedents, the Secretary of War should immediately rescind his recent inconsiderate and unlawful order granting the Roman Catholic church the privilege of erecting a church on ground at West Point, belonging to the United States. Can a cabinet officer do what Congress could not do?

William Birney.

Washington, May 6, 1897.
