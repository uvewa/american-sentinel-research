Among the reasons set forth in a recent communication to the Board of Trustees of Carnegie Hall, Pittsburg, protesting against the opening of the hall for Sunday concerts, we note this:—

"3rd. As Christians we find abundant authority for our position in the Word of God, but to those who take a different view of Scripture, or decline obedience to its mandates, we respectfully call attention to the fact that the First General Assembly of Pennsylvania, on December 7, 1682, in passing the first law in regard to the observance of the 'Lord's Day, commonly called Sunday,' declared that 'for the ease of creation people shall abstain from their usual common toil and labor, that they may better dispose themselves to read the Scriptures of truth at home and frequent meetings of religious worship.' Many unsuccessful attempts have been made to repeal or amend this law, but it has remained in force down to the present time. Besides this, it is well settled among Anglo-Saxon nations that neither amusement nor labor should be carried on on the Lord's Day."

So then, those who "take a different view of Scripture," whether they revere the Word of God or not, ought to set that aside in deference to this ancient colonial ordinance, passed by the "First General Assembly" of Pennsylvania, under the impression that they were legislating "for the ease of creation"! Do the parties who made this protest hold the Scriptures so lightly themselves?

As to the attitude of Anglo-Saxon nations toward the "Lord's Day," if it be not a fact that more amusement is "carried on" on Sunday than on any other day of the week, both our own observations and the testimony of the press are sadly at fault.

Another reason given in the protest is that "The concerts are likely to interfere seriously with the attendance upon the afternoon sessions of the Church and Sunday schools." But have not the one class of citizens as much right to hold a concert on Sunday, as the other class have to hold a Sunday school? Are rights determined under this Government by class distinctions?

It is surprising that a cause which appeals so largely to credulity and prejudice as does that of Sunday legislation, can make such progress in this country as it does.
