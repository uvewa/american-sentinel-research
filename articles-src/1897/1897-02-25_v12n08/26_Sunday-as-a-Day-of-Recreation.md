REPRESENTATIVE ENGLEY, of the Colorado House, recently gave a somewhat startling variation to the usual course of Sunday legislation by introducing a bill to make Sunday in that State, from a legal point of view, "a day for the rest, recreation, or amusement of the people, as they may see fit," and providing for the fining and imprisonment of "any person or persons interfering with the privileges and rights of the people as conferred by this act." The bill was defeated by only three votes. The attempt called out an attack from the Ministerial Alliance of Denver, who denounced the bill in strong terms. Evidently they have no desire for a taste of their own medicine.
