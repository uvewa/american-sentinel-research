JANUARY 12, 1897, the first session of the twenty-fifth legislature of Texas, convened at Austin, and on the 15th, House Bill No. 11, for the promotion of Sunday sacredness, appeared, which reads as follows:

"Any person who shall hereafter labor or compel, force or oblige his employés, workmen or apprentices, to labor on Sunday, or any person who shall hereafter play base ball, foot ball, or any other game of like kind on Sunday; or any person who shall hereafter hunt game, of any kind whatsoever on Sunday, within one mile of any church, school-house, or private residence, shall be fined not less than twenty-five nor more than one hundred dollars."

This bill was read the first time and referred to Judiciary Committee No. 2, and on the 18th of January, it was by the committee reported back to the House with recommendation to pass with the following amendments:

Section (1) to be amended by inserting after "whatsoever," the words, "with firearms and dogs, or either," and by striking out the words "within one mile of any church, school, or private residence;" thus making it a misdemeanor to work, hunt, or play ball of any kind anywhere in Texas on Sundays.

On the 21st of January the Judiciary Committee reported it correctly engrossed, and on January 23, it was read the third time and passed. January 26, Mr. Ward called up the motion to reconsider the vote by which the bill was passed. The motion to reconsider prevailed, and the bill was again laid before the House on its final passage.

Mr. Ward then offered an amendment to the bill, covering that part of it which related to the hunting of game, as follows:

"Or any person who shall hereafter hunt game of any kind whatsoever on Sunday within one half mile of any church, school-house, or private residence; or any person or persons who shall hereafter play baseball, football, or any game of like kind on Sunday, within one half mile of any church, or any other place of public worship, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction shall be fined in any sum not less than $30 nor more than $200."

Mr. Love offered, to amend the amendment by striking out the words "one half mile" and inserting the words "one mile." This was tabled by motion of Mr. Ward.

Mr. Ward's amendment was put and lost.

On the question of final passage the bill was lost by 55 yeas to 57 nays.

The following words spoken on the occasion by Representative J. F. Wolters, show that there is yet left in Texas some patriotism and regard for personal liberty:—

"I vote 'No' on House Bill No. 11, in its original form, as well as in its amended form. In my opinion the churches in Texas are amply protected by the laws now upon our statute books. I believe that private residences and the inhabitants thereof are amply protected. I consider this bill an infringement upon the rights of the citizens of Texas to enjoy the freedom of thought and action guaranteed them by the Constitution, to the perpetuation of which the Democratic party is pledged by the most sacred ties of tradition and by clearly enunciated declarations in the Democratic platform upon which the great majority of the members of this House, including myself, were elected.

"Believing in the undying principles of democracy which has for its keystone the great principle that in a free government every citizen should be permitted to think and to act as he may please, so long as he does not infringe the rights of any other citizen, I vote 'No.'"

In times like this when there is such a cry and demand for legislation on religious subjects, it is refreshing indeed to hear utterances like the above, so publicly and boldly set forth; and although we know from the sure Word of prophecy that it cannot be long before such voices will be heard no more, or at least when heard cried down, we thank God and take courage to step into the openings as they present themselves, ever remembering that "eternal vigilance is the price of liberty."

Austin, Texas, Feb. 14, 1897.
