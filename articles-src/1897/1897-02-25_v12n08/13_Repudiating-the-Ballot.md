The following from a letter by General Master Workman Sovereign, of the Knights of Labor, was printed in the New York Herald, of February 15. It indicates in a startling manner how far the country has already lapsed from the standard of Republican government, and the proximity of national perils which have been wont to attend monarchy and imperialism:—

"Private Dalzell, in a Washington newspaper, seems to overlook the fact that in the recent election one million voters in this country lost faith in the ballot, and that the Iron Brotherhood and the Industrial Army, both secret revolutionary societies, are now being organized in every part of the country.

"What we need is an agitation at home that will force the people to a test against our own social and economic disorders. Scarcely a day passes that I do not read one or more appeals to join one or the other of the revolutionary orders now being formed in this country, and offers of money and arms are frequently received if I will give my efforts to the cause of revolution.

"Thus far I have persistently declined to give aid or encouragement to such movement. But if, through the writings of such men as Private Dalzell, revolutions come in spite of all efforts to prevent it, I will not be found among the cowards, nor on the side of the plutocratic classes.

"One word in favor of war with a foreign country will multiply tenfold into a desire for revolution at home. The general unrest of the people is not caused by a hatred of foreign nations, but because of robbery imposed on them by class legislation of our own Government, and if incited to war as a relief, they will direct their attack against the source of their oppression, and not against a foreign nation that did not possess the administrative power to impose the conditions from which they suffer.

"These facts should be considered by Private Dalzell before invoking heaven to hasten war with another country. I still have hopes of a peaceful solution of our difficulties, and will work to that end; but if, as Private Dalzell says, the only remedy is in war, I prefer to have the war at home.

"What moral right have we to impose war, with all its cruelties and destruction and desolation, on a foreign country as a means of relieving our own distress and the result of our errors? Furthermore, to provoke a foreign country to war would not prove a permanent remedy for domestic wrongs. It would inflate the volume of government securities and impose increased burdens on the debtor classes. It might also result in adding our country to the conquests of some monarchical or despotic power, and make us slaves to tyranny and oppression. Insurrections start with a spark and are quenched with a deluge.

"One reason in favor of insurrection to idle, starving and overburdened people is more potent in exciting war than a thousand reasons against insurrections in preserving the peace. Dalzell may not know what the secret revolutionary societies are doing. For his benefit I will quote the following from the prelude of a secret circular now being distributed by one of the revolutionary societies just mentioned:

" 'COMRADES: There comes a time in the affairs of men and nations when desperation compels the human mind to pause and bring to its aid that element of reason so long discarded. We have reached such a crisis in the destinies of this American Republic.

" 'One hundred years of national existence has demonstrated that the political fabric of our Government contains within its warp and woof the elements of its own destruction, with the fact that the ballot has proven a most lamentable failure as a safeguard of free institutions.

" 'In the closing of the nineteenth century we see a class despotism establishing itself upon the ruins of the Republic. An oligarchy is now in power, and already the hideous phantom of imperialism overshadows us, as embodied in the autocratic claims of the Federal Court and the acts of unbridled military despotism characteristic of the Federal Government of to-day.

" 'What is to be done? We have appealed in vain to the ballot. Every trial of strength in the political arena has resulted in victory for the unscrupulous money power.

" 'There is nothing surprising in this. The ballot is a weapon best wielded by the hand of cunning and craft. History records no nation that freed itself by voting. No: let us be frank. The hour has come for men to lay aside the mask and look each other in the face.

" 'Fellow reformer, would you be free? Would you see the regime of corporate power and class despotism at an end? Would you see the shackles stricken forever from the limbs of humanity and behold emancipation, the rebirth of the nation which Jefferson revered, that Paine wrote and wrought to establise? Do you believe that this can come through the ballot? No, you do not.

" 'Have not the Reformers spent their lives, their fortunes and their energies in the cause of political reform through the ballot box, and what has been the result?

" 'Have they not seen the cunning and unscrupulous always victorious, emerging from every campaign master of the spoils? Have you any hopes that this will be changed in the future? The past is one long protest against the ballot as an instrument of reformation.'
