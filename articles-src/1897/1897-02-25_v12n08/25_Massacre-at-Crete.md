ANOTHER great massacre is reported from the island of Crete, which has become the storm centre of European politics. This time, however, it is the Mohammedans who have been massacred by the "Christians." Two thousand of the former are reported slain—men, women, and children—constituting almost the entire population of the town of Litia. We have not noticed any expressions of horror from Christendom over this occurrence.

The term "Christian" is here applied to the perpetrators of this massacre with the same propriety as when it is used in designating the United States or any of the great powers as a "Christian nation." If the manner and spirit exemplified in the slaughter at Litia were Christian, then the use of that term as here mentioned is appropriate. But where was any such spirit ever exhibited by Christ?

Christians do not constitute a military power in this world, nor fight with carnal weapons.
