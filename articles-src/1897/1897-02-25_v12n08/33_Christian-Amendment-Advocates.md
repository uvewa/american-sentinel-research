ONE great difficulty in the way of reform legislation, writes an advocate of the "Christian Amendment to the Constitution," is that legislators do not know what "the people" want. So he urges those in favor of such an amendment to write to their representatives in Congress, urging its adoption. Then Congress will know what "the people" think about it! In no direction are the religious amendmentists working harder than in that of trying to impress Congress with the idea that they are the people of the United States.
