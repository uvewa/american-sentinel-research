THE Catholic Standard and Times reports a professed Protestant doctor of divinity who explains "the growing tendency among Protestants to take up doctrines of the Catholic Church" "as being due to the reaction, or swinging back of the pendulum, from the radical departure taken at the time of the so-called Reformation—which, like all reforms, went too far." Yes, and when these compromisers shall have succeeded in thus reforming the Reformation, there will be upon the world again the pall of the Dark Ages.
