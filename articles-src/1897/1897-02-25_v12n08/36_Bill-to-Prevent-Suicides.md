A BILL now pending in Congress bears the title, "To prevent the multiplication of suicides." It is worthy of notice as illustrating the tendency among would-be reformers to believe that legislation is capable of providing a panacea for every ill. The prevalence of suicide will no doubt be proportionate with the increase of poverty, drunkenness, and vice.
