TORONTO, Ont., is the banner city of America in point of legal Sunday observance; but it has a "Lord's Day Alliance," which is not by any means behind like organizations elsewhere in active work. This Alliance is now besieging the Provincial government for a compulsory half-holiday each week in all the shops. Besides this, they also ask that all shops except drug stores be closed on Saturday evenings at nine o'clock. The government has promised to take the matter into consideration.

These "Lord's Day" Alliances do no mean to go out of business with the concession of their first demands.
