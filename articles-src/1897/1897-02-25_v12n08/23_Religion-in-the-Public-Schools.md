THE doubtful utility of teaching religion in the public schools, as demanded by many people, is illustrated by the following quotation from a recent discourse in the chapel of Leland Stanford University, by a professor of the University of California:—

"The idea of salvation, for instance, which belongs to theology and not religion, and on which rests the whole scheme of Christ's position in the Church, is fast losing ground. The need of salvation is not a natural feeling, else there would be no need of revivals to create it. The belief rests entirely on authority and will be gradually cast aside, for beliefs founded on authority alone cannot live."

Also this, spoken on the same occasion:

"The character of Jesus has suffered in this way. He has been attacked by skeptics as he never could have been had not too zealous believers lifted him out of the pale of humanity into Deity. Nobody would think of picking to pieces his beautiful sermons and the account of his life, had not the claim of absolute perfection been set up for him—a claim he never advanced for himself."

If religion is to be taught in the schools by college professors, it is pretty certain that it will be mainly the teaching of the "higher criticism."
