"Montana Bivouac," February 1.

Already two Sunday bills have been introduced in the Montana Legislature. One is for closing the saloons on Sunday, and the other, if passed, will be a general Sunday law, reading as follows:—

"An Act to prevent the transaction and performance of business or work, except business or works of necessity, charity or mercy, on Sunday, and to amend certain laws in relation thereto.

"Section 1. That Section 531 of the Penal Code of Montana be and the same is amended to read as follows:—

"Section 531. Every person who transacts, conducts or performs any business, work or labor, except works of necessity, charity or mercy, on Sunday, or the first day of the week, is guilty of a misdemeanor.

"Provided, This Act does not apply to any person who habitually observes and keeps some other day of the week as the Sabbath, and abstains from his usual avocation on such day.

"Section 2. Section 532 of the Penal Code of Montana, being a section of said act, is hereby amended so as to read as follows:—

"Section 532. Every person who violates any provisions of this Act shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined for the first offense any sum not less than $10, and not more than $50, and shall be fined for any subsequent violation any sum not less than $25, and not more than $1,000."

How is this for a Rocky Mountain State whose very air ought to inspire freedom in every individual?
