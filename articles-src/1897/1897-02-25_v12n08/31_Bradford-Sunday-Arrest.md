ISAAC NUSBAUM, a storekeeper, of Bradford, Pa., was arrested February 9, for having sold goods on Sunday in violation of the law. He was held in $100 bail for trial, which was set for the 19th. It appears that the arrest was due to a determination on the part of Nusbaum to disregard a compact of the clerks of the city for the early closing of stores. It is frequently the case that the Sunday law is used to force compliance in some direction not contemplated at all by its requirements.
