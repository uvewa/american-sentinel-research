In one of the cities of the West, lately, it was arranged to celebrate by a ball, the opening of a new union depot. The celebration happened to be appointed for a Wednesday night.

"The ministers of sixteen churches of the city" published "an emphatic protest," among other things, "against the presumption of arranging for such an opening on the night generally conceded to the prayer-meet-meeting, without any consultation with those most nearly concerned."

This is another of those general pointers that show how determined are the preachers to rule everybody and everything. They insist that people who are not religious shall conform in an altogether outward and formal way, to the ways and institutions of those who are religious. That is, they insist that people who are not religious, shall act as though they were religious, when they have no heart in it.

People who are not religious have just as much right to find entertainment in the way that they choose, as the people who are religious have to find entertainment in the way that they choose. In other words, people who are not religious have just as much right to go to a ball as people who are religious have to go to a prayer-meeting. And there is no sort of presumption in those who are not religious, going to such entertainment on the same night that the religious ones go to prayer-meeting. Indeed, the only presumption in the case is in anybody calling such a thing presumption.

Now we are not admitting for one moment that a ball is as good as a prayer-meeting. There is no kind of comparison between them. A ball is not a good thing at all; while a prayer-meeting is only good. But there is also a great difference between the two sorts of people. The people who go to balls, ought to go to prayer-meet-meeting instead. They ought never to go to balls at all; and they ought to go to prayer-meeting every time. But all this must be of their own free choice. And to show a disposition that would compel them to go to prayer-meeting if we could; or that censures them for going somewhere else on prayer-meeting night; is not the best way to cause them to choose, or incline them, to go to the prayer-meeting.
