**Over-Conscientious.**

**BY W. E. CORNELL.**

It is a remarkable coincidence that during the last year or so particularly, there has sprung up, not only in our own country, but in other lands as well, and even in the islands of the sea, a wonderful zeal on the part of Sunday observers for the preservation of the day from the inroads of "Continentalism."

It is really pitiful how frantic some of the appeals are, and what momentous consequences hinge on the success of their efforts in this direction. It is such a wicked thing for the laboring men of our large cities to take their families on the only day they are free, to the parks, the lakes, or any other place where a breath of fresh air can be secured, that these Sunday guardians would stop every railroad train, every street car, or other means of conveyance to these resorts. It reminds one of the time during the Dark Ages when men who showed signs of apostacy from the church were sacrificed in order to save their souls. However, these very zealous people have no compunctions of conscience in demanding of their kitchen girl that she do double duty on that day in preparing an extra fine "Sunday dinner," because they are to entertain the reverend so and so. They are too pious to read a Sunday newspaper, and would suppress every one of them, yet if they be ministers, they are only too glad to use its columns in which to make their announcements; and it is a notorious fact that the advertising columns of the Sunday issue of our dailies are more largely patronized by the church-going business men than any other issue of the week.

There is so much hypocritical pious cant, such glaring inconsistencies and straining at gnats and swallowing camels in much of this effort, that it is not to be wondered at that it is receiving some merited satirical rebukes. A late issue of *Judge* puts it this way:

"I hear that the Rev. Brother Thirdly has refused an increase of salary," said Mr. Gummy to Mr. Glanders.

"Yes, that is true."

"Rather remarkable thing, wasn't it? I never heard of a clergyman doing such a thing before."

"Yes, his refusal was a strange thing in itself, but the reason he gave for his refusal was even more remarkable."

"What reason did he offer?"

"He said that his present income was quite sufficient for his wants, and that if he had an increase of salary he would have more than he could use conveniently. That would oblige him to put some of his money in the bank, where interest would be earned incessantly on his deposits, and he really couldn't think of letting his money earn interest on Sunday."

We admire honesty of purpose in a man, even though his efforts be directed in behalf of a bad cause; but when he sets himself up to pluck out the motes that he imagines are in his brother's eye, while at the same time he is blinded by the beams that darken his own vision, he need not feel grieved if there are occasionally administered to him some pretty sound rebukes.
