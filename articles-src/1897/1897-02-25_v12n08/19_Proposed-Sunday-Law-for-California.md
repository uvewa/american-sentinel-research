**Proposed Sunday Law for California.**

The following Sunday bill was introduced in the California Legislature by Mr. Emmons, of the Assembly, February 2:

**"AN ACT**

"To Amend the Penal Code of this State by Adding Three Sections Thereto, to be Known as Sections 299, 300, and 301, Relating to Sunday, and the Opening of Certain Places of Business on that Day.

"The People of the State of California, represented in Senate and Assembly, do enact as follows:—

"Section 1. Three new sections are hereby added to the Penal Code of this State, to be known respectively, as sections two hundred and ninety-nine, three hundred, and three hundred and one, and to read as follows, to wit:

"Section 299. Every person who, on the Christian Sabbath gets up, exhibits, opens, or maintains, or aids in getting up, exhibiting, opening, or maintaining, any bull, bear, cock, or prize fight, horse race, circus, gambling-house, or saloon, or any barbarous and noisy amusement.

"Section 300. Every person who keeps open on Sunday any store, workshop, bar, saloon, banking house, or other place of business, for the purpose of transacting business therein, is punishable by fine not less than five nor more than fifty dollars.

"Section 301. The provisions of the preceding section do not apply to persons who, on Sunday, keep open hotels, boarding-houses, barber shops, baths, markets, restaurants, taverns, livery stables, or retail drug stores, for the legitimate business of each, or such manufacturing establishments as are usually kept in continued operation; provided, that the provisions of the preceding section shall apply to persons keeping open barber shops, bath-houses, and hair-dressing saloons after twelve o'clock meridian, on Sunday."

A correspondent writes us from Sacramento that this bill was placed in the hands of the Committee on Judiciary, instead of the Committee on Morals, because the clergy who are back of it discovered that the latter Committee were not favorable to Sunday legislation.
