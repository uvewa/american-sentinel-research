In the New York Christian Advocate of February 11, we note the following:—

"It has been reserved for the State of Nevada to descend to a lower step of legislative degradation than has been sounded by any State in the Republic for many a year. For a long time the instigators of the brutal prize fight have been driven from State to State with their debasing exhibitions by legislative enactment. Even in Texas, which many ill-informed persons seem to think is the synonym of things uncivilized, a special session of the legislature was held, when an invasion of the State was threatened, to pass a law forbidding the bullies of the prize ring from disgracing the name of that State with their performances.

But Nevada is now to become the nursing-mother of prize fighters. Nevada, with a diminishing population—a State whose transformation into a Territory would not be regarded as lamentable by the country at large—has passed a law licensing prize fights at the rate of $1,000 apiece. The honor of the nation is besmirched when a State passes such a pernicious piece of legislation, over which good men hang their heads in shame and the members of the short-haired gentry rejoice.

"The governor of a Western State, when invited to give expression to the extraordinary and unfortunate conduct of the Nevada governor and legislators, uttered his sentiments in these vigorous words:—

"I do not hesitate to go on record as saying that I regard the act of legalizing prize fighting in Nevada as being not only unpardonably pernicious, but utterly iniquitous and monstrous. Under the most favorable circumstances, the prize ring has always been the resort of law-breakers and ruffians, as a rule, and the startling intelligence that one of the States, dignified by a place in the Union, has deliberately entered into copartnership with professional promoters of public exhibitions of unspeakable brutality, and prostituted its power in aid of undisguised lawlessness, presents a phase of degradation that must necessarily be regarded as a crime against society, and such a distinct reproach to our boasted civilization that the effect cannot be otherwise than to condemn us as a people by thus offending the moral sentiment and provoking the righteous criticism of the enlightened nations of the globe."

We notice this only because of some queries which naturally connect themselves with it, which call for explanation; and the more so because the above quotation seems to express the ideas of a large number of more or less eminent authorities upon the subject.

Do these would-be teachers of morality and molders of public opinion really think that it is worse to license a prize fight than to license a saloon? We know what the fruits of the saloon are, and if there can be any more baneful, we would like to be told what they are. Yet almost every State in the Union licenses thousands of grog shops, to say nothing of gambling bells, and other places of vice and debauchery. Is there any disgrace in this?

Do these things constitute any reproach to our "boasted civilization"?

It would seem not, in the view of those who have been so shocked at the action of the governor and legislature of Nevada. If otherwise, why are such things not "driven from State to State, with their debasing exhibitions, by legislative enactment"?

Some States have enforced Sunday laws upon honest, conscientious observers of the seventh-day Sabbath, punishing them by fine and imprisonment, and even working them in the chain-gang. Yet we never heard from any of the leading religious journals that there was any disgrace in this to State or Nation.

Several hundred thousand men—husbands and fathers—go down every year into drunkards' graves, several hundred thousand homes are blasted, several hundred thousand children made paupers, through the grog shops licensed in every part of the land. Yet the "honor of the nation" was all unsullied, until at last it was "besmirched" by a bill to legalize prize fights!

More than this; the State of New York itself has for some time licensed "glove contests," and contests of this kind are conducted in the heart of New York City, between which and the contests licensed in Nevada there is not, as to character, the difference between tweedledee and tweedledum. Yet it is only the State of Nevada which has been thereby brought into disgrace!

This, and much more that might be said, prompts the query before mentioned,—Do these persons who are declaiming so loudly against the State of Nevada really believe what is plainly inferred from their words? If they do, then as moral teachers they are about as reliable as were the Pharisees denounced by the Saviour, who strained at a gnat and swallowed a camel.

If, on the other hand, they do not believe what in effect they say, they are guilty of disgraceful hypocrisy.

In either case, we can but wonder what kind of a standard of morality these persons must possess, by which to justify such teaching. And what will become of sound public sentiment under the molding influence of such teachers? Can it be expected that it will be anything else than pharisaical?

The disposition to gloss over great iniquities, while laying great stress upon the wickedness of comparatively small offenses, is one of the most baleful signs of the times. When this was done by the Pharisees of old, the nation of Israel was nigh to its end.

The great need of the hour is for men of principle,—men who will denounce evil not because it may be fashionable to do so, but simply because it is evil, and who will condemn it in proportion to its magnitude, no matter how firmly it may have become entrenched in law and custom; men who are not seeking for some cheap expedient by which to acquire a reputation for morality; men who know the difference between true morality and "respectability;" men to whom character is of more value than reputation. In short, the great need of the hour is for more Christians.
