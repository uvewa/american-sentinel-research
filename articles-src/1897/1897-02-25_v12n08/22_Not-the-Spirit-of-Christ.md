**Not the Spirit of Christ.**

*"Pitkin (Pa.) Miner," January 29.*

TRUE Christians should try to exemplify the character of our Saviour. But how about the great denominations of professed Christians of to-day? Do they possess the noble attributes so profusely displayed by Jesus when he was upon earth?

Did our Saviour curry favor with the "powers that be" in order to advance his teachings, or did he appeal to the God-loving and God-fearing element within man, and plead earnestly with him to accept the gift of "eternal life?" Coercion and the struggle for civil power, now going on, to compel people to worship God according to man-made laws, were never taught by Christ.

The Saviour was crucified and nailed to the cross by so-called religious people. . . . This same affection governs the powerful church denominations of to-day. The zeal shown in the endeavor to get civil authority in their hands is every day apparent. All true Christians should be characterized by liberality and charity.

Let every one worship God in the manner dictated by their own conscience. The world will be better off by so doing.
