The New York Christian Advocate, the leading Methodist organ in this country, recently expressed itself on the subject of governmental chaplains, by saying that in many cases they are "undesirable ministers unloaded upon the Army and Navy by the different denominations;" that they are characterized by "indifference and intemperance," and that they "make the position a sinecure, finding their pleasure in ease, travel, and society." We are not disposed to question these statements. All the evidence we have met with on the subject confirms their truthfulness. Nor is anything else to be expected from an attempt to combine a civil with an ecclesiastical office. The wonder is that the Government should in the face of such facts, still retain this Church-and-State feature. But instead of abolishing the office, Congress is now asked to remedy the difficulty by providing that applicants for it shall undergo a rigid examination. This, too, notwithstanding that clause of the Constitution which excludes any religious test in determining the fitness of applicants for governmental positions.
