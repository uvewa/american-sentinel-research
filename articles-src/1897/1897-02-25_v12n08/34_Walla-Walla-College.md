THE Walla Walla College, Washington, conducts a Correspondence School in addition to the regular work of the College. We are acquainted with the Faculty and its work, and can heartily recommend it to all who would like to have the advantage of systematic instruction at home. A new term is to begin March 1, 1897. For further information, address Prof. E. A. Sutherland, College Place, Washington.
