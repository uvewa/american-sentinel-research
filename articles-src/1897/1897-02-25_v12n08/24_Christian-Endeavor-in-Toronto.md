**"Christian Endeavor" in Toronto.**

A Toronto journal makes the following notes of a recent Christian Endeavor convention in that city:

"At the first meeting of the Toronto Union, held after the regular annual meeting for the election of officers for the present year, a large portion of the time was devoted to devising ways and means for suppressing 'Sabbath desecration,' as they were pleased to call honest civil employment on the first day of the week.

"Attention was directed particularly to good citizenship work by communication from the Westminster Presbyterian and Cooke's societies. The communication of the former society spoke of the desecration of the sabbath last summer in the public parks, and was referred to the Good Citizenship Committee, while the latter communication alluded to the agitation raised by the city milkmen to have the Sunday milk delivered on Saturday. The Union heartily sympathized with the Dairymen's Association in their efforts to suppress Sunday labor, and passed a resolution to that effect.

"The Good Citizenship Committee was given full power to act as it deemed best in the distribution of literature and the providing of scrutineers in the elections that are expected to take place at an early date on the question of Sunday cars and prohibition.

"It was agreed that the banner which the Union intended presenting to the suggested Lord's Day Alliance canvass be reserved to be given as a reward for the best service by any society in the coming Sunday street-car contest, provided the societies which had entered the competition previously announced consented to this arrangement.

"The Union placed on record its approval of the aims and objects of the Lord's Day Alliance, and left each society to determine—with the approval of its own church authorities—how it could best assist the Alliance in forwarding its work."

We are as strongly opposed to the desecration of the Sabbath as anyone can be, but we are more strongly opposed to the methods adopted by the Christian Endeavor Union for its suppression, even supposing the first day of the week to be the Sabbath. We had supposed that the work of suppressing sin was one which was accomplished by the preaching of the gospel to the sinner, not by setting ourselves as spies to watch him; and when detected in sin, to set the police after him, instead of praying with him.
