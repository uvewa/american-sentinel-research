By statute and by the arbitrary will of judges in "common law" decisions, the State of New York requires everybody to be idle at least one whole day each week.

If any should be so altogether obstreperous as quietly to engage in perfectly honest labor—in other words, if he should fail to be idle on Sunday—then, if he should refuse to pay a fine, he would be imprisoned, and so compelled to be idle all the time.

Surely it must be that the people of the State of New York think that idleness is the chief end of man.
