REPORTS from Bahia, Brazil, state that a band of about 3,000 religious fanatics, armed with Winchester rifles, are intrenched in the mountains of that State, and that their leader has proclaimed a "holy war" for the re-establishment of religion and the monarchy. The government has undertaken to suppress them, and several battles have been fought, with great loss of life.
