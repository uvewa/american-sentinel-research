## More Sunday-Law Arrests in Arkansas.

THE following letter, addressed to Mr. A. F. Ballenger, from an Adventist friend in Arkansas, has been received at our office:—

"Van Buren, Ark., April 22, '97.

"Dear Brother:

"Brother John Huddleston and myself were arrested for Sunday labor at Fort Smith, Ark., on the 4th inst.

"We had commenced to build a house the Sunday before, and the sheriff said that he had received four complaints on Monday morning—one before daylight, before he got up. He did not bother us that week, but on the following Sunday, the 4th inst., he came down and talked awhile with us about the weather, work, etc., concealing his badge, and after awhile he asked me if I did not know that I was violating the law. I told him that we kept another day than Sunday as the Sabbath; whereupon he remarked with an oath 'That's too thin,' and said he would arrest us both, at the same time exhibiting his official badge. I told him that Bro. H. had been tried for Sunday labor and came clear, and that we had an exemption clause for our benefit; but he would not listen to me and ordered us to put up our tools and go with him to see if we could give bond.

"On our way to the Justice of the Peace's office we passed a man with a wheelbarrow full of sod, working with all his might putting the sod out in his yard with a shovel. I called the officer's attention to it, and also to the street-car driver, telling him that neither one of them kept the day before; but he paid no attention to them. I then told him that it was very plain to me that it was not because we worked on Sunday that we were arrested, but because we kept the Sabbath; that there were a number of vagabonds in the city who would not work at all, and that it would be better to let all work who would.

"He told us that our bonds would be $25 each; but on our way to the office we met the Prosecuting Attorney and he said 'Put the bonds at $100 each.' So the sheriff marched us down through town to the Justice's office; but the Justice being absent, the sheriff with some difficulty made out the bonds for us.

"Then we went to the home of Bro. H.'s brother—not a seventh-day observer—to get him to go on our bonds, but on arriving his wife said he was at the river where he was building a small steamboat. When we got there the officer remarked: "Here is another man at work." Mr. H. was leveling up his boat on the dock, but he did not attempt to arrest him. However, it was just over the line in the Indian Territory.

"Mr. H. signed our bonds and we were released. I then told him that we were going back to work and that if we were going to be arrested again we would make out our bonds and carry them with us to save time and trouble; but he said that we would not be bothered again. So we went and worked that afternoon.

"Our trial was set for the next day (Monday) at 3 P.M. Two hours before the time I was there, and the sheriff introduced me to the Justice of the Peace. The latter, after a few questions relative to our faith, said he would dismiss the cases. I told him that we were ready for trial and would rather it would go on, but he would not order it. I had a long talk with him and with the sheriff and gave them some reading matter, and showed them the account of the Arkansas persecutions as given in "Two Republics." He seemed much interested in it and said he would read up on the subject. I am using all the reading matter I have and could use a good deal more to good advantage.

"Nothing saves us here from suffering the severest penalties of the law but the exemption clause. Our enemies are eager to prosecute.

"Pray for us that we may do efficient work for the Master.

"H. CLAY GRIFFIN."
