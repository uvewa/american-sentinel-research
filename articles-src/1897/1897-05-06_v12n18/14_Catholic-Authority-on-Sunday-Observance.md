## Catholic Authority on Sunday Observance.

The following information on the subject of proper Sunday observance is given by the *Pilot*, the leading Catholic journal of New England, in its issue of March 13:

"An esteemed local correspondent of the *Pilot* asks an immediate answer to these questions:—

"'Is it wrong to play cards on Sunday for small sums when the conduct is orderly and the religious duties are fulfilled? Under the same conditions is card-playing allowed in Lent? Is it allowable among friends on a Sunday evening to have dancing in a quiet way?'

"To play cards on Sunday under the conditions above stated is not wrong in itself; but in the State of Massachusetts, at least, it is against the law, and subjects the participants in the game to arrest. Catholics should set an example of respect for the law, even in comparatively small things. Card-playing is not forbidden in Lent. Devout Catholics, however, discontinue attendance at card-parties during Lent, as with far greater reason they abstain from dancing and theatre-going, these amusements not being in the spirit of the season of penance and retirement. Dancing on Sundays, without being necessarily sinful, is opposed to good public opinion religiously and is bad form socially."

Thus it is all right in itself to gamble and dance on Sunday; and this may be regarded as authoritative on the subject, since Sunday as a day of rest and worship is an institution of the Roman Catholic church.
