## Some Significant Statistics.

The *Christian Observer* (Presbyterian), of Louisville, Ky., in its issue of March 24, gives the following statistics of church attendance in that city, the reliability of which cannot be questioned. Unless Louisville be an exceptional city—which cannot be reasonably assumed—these statistics have an ominous significance in relation to the question of the general church attendance in this so-called "Christian nation." Do they not speak with startling emphasis of the need of a power nothing short of the "power of God unto salvation" to awaken the people from their condition of spiritual death? Nothing less than God's own power can meet the emergency; and this power is in the simple gospel of his Word. The *Observer* says:—

"In so far as church attendance is a guage of the spiritual life and activity of the members, a census of the church attendance reveals the extent and the depth of spirituality in the community. With this in view, and with the kind coöperation of the young men of our Theological Seminaries and of the Young Men's Christian Association, we have recently obtained a report from almost all the evangelical churches in the city of Louisville. In this report are included the seating capacity of the churches, the number of church members on the roll, the number of accessions on profession of faith during the year 1896, and the number present at the morning and the evening services on the Lord's day, at Sunday school, and at the mid-week prayer-meeting. The result of the census is as follows:—

|  91 Churches report seating capacity | 39,898  |
| --- | --- |
|  84 " " membership | 25,423  |
|  54 " " men joined (1896) | 489  |
|  70 " " number joined (1896) | 2,337  |
|  87 " " at morning service | 14,588  |
|  85 " " at evening service | 10,483  |
|  84 " " at Sunday school | 13,829  |
|  53 " " at prayer-meeting | 2,207  |

"The population of the city is not far from two hundred thousand persons. According to the census of 1890 it had 161,129 inhabitants. Since that time there has been a natural growth, and also an increase by reason of the annexation of several suburbs. One estimate places the population as high as 215,000.

"Assuming the moderate estimate of 200,000 as its real population, we must deduct for those who have some valid reason for absence from the house of God on the sabbath.

"As the statistics given do not include the colored churches, we must first deduct about 35,000 for the colored population of the city. Of the remaining 165,000, we may assume that about one-sixth are Roman Catholics, and that they attend, with more or less regularity, on their own services. There are also some Jews. Of the 130,000 who remain, perhaps one-fifth are infants and children too young to attend church. Invalids and aged people also may be detained through necessity. And for the care of the infants or of the sick, and for works of imperative necessity (such as would warrant absence from the sanctuary), a yet further allowance must be made. If now we deduct thirty per cent. of the 130,000 as thus detained from one or both services, on any particular sabbath, we shall find in the city about 90,000 who ought to be in the house of God every sabbath, and the most of whom might be expected to attend on the mid-week prayer-meeting.

"There are in this city ninety-eight Protestant churches, besides twenty-five mission preaching points.

"The reports gathered by these young men show that in the ninety-one churches counted, the seating capacity is only 39,898. It would thus appear that in all our evangelical churches for whites, we have room to seat only about one fourth of the people of the city, and less than one half of those who should be expected there on the sabbath day. Does not this afford food for thought?

"Of the white people of this city, probably about 130,000 are to be counted as non-Catholic. Of these, perhaps two-thirds, or nearly 90,000, are of an age to understand and accept the gospel and unite with the church. But the reports that have been brought to us show (in 84 churches) only 25,423 church members, somewhat more than one fourth, and less than one third. Surely this will suggest the room and the need for Christian work in order to reach this vast mass of unconverted people.

"In years gone by, the attendance at church on any sabbath was in excess of the number of members. But from this census it appears that now the number of people present in the churches on sabbath morning is less than three fifths of the membership. In 87 churches, our co-workers found only 14,588 persons present at the morning service. And at night the attendance in 85 churches, as reported to us, was only 10,483, or about two fifths of the membership. If a reasonable part of the attendants were unconverted people, then it would appear that only about half of the church members were at the house of God in the morning, and only about one third of them at the night services.

"This fact may explain why it is that seventy per cent. of the white population of Louisville over twelve years of age are not members of the church. When the people of God neglect the sanctuary, they cannot expect the children of the world to come. If all the Christians in the city would go to church with regularity, they would give to the services a warmth and an interest which would draw the outsiders and lead them also to attend.

"The Sunday school attendance gives us greater encouragement. Of the 13,000 non-Catholic white population of this city, about 40,000 are between five and twenty years of age. Out of these we find a sabbath school attendance of 13,829, which would give us a Sunday school enrollment of about 18,000, nearly one half. (This includes teachers and also infant classes.)

"But all this encouragement disappears when we note the poverty of the attendance at the mid-week prayer-meeting. Out of the 90,000 people who *might* be there, the count just made (in fifty-three churches) shows only 2,207 actually present. This indicates only about three thousand people at prayer-meeting on Wednesday night in this great city of Louisville, about one in thirty of the adult Protestant people, and only one eighth of the church members. 'Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?'"

Are not these the days spoken of by the Apostle Paul (2 Tim. 2:1–5), when there was to be but a "form of god; lines," with a denial of its power? There are churches there are creeds and ceremonies; but where is the power of God?
