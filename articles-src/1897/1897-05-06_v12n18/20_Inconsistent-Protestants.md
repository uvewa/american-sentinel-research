## Inconsistent Protestants.

The Bible Echo (Protestant), of Melbourne, Australia, in its issue of March 8, makes some pertinent and forcible observations upon an exhibition of inconsistency recently given there by a conclave of Protestant clergymen. As we have previously mentioned, there is now in process of formation a federation of the six Australian colonies, the convention for the purpose of effecting this having assembled March 20. Among the candidates for election to this convention was Cardinal Moran. His candidature was viewed with alarm by the Protestant clergy, and a number of them met in Sydney, February 16, to protest against it. At this meeting they passed a resolution setting forth that,—

"It is impossible to separate the person of Francis Patrick Moran from the position occupied by him as a Roman Catholic Cardinal and Archbishop of Sydney. The entry of so high an ecclesiastic into the political arena necessarily means the stirring up of sectarian rancor, and the introduction of a most undesirable element into the federal elections."

Also that,—

"Since his arrival in Australia, Cardinal Moran has persistently played the part of the religious controversialist on every possible opportunity. He has assailed the religious faiths and practices of his Protestant fellow-colonists; has championed the imperious and impossible claims of the Roman See to absolute supremacy; and has also resorted to statements which have been proved to be untrue to discredit the apostolic labors of men and societies connected with the branches of Christendom which we represent. These statements, when proved to be untrue, have not been withdrawn or apologized for. The unprovoked character of these attacks shows the bias of the Cardinal's mind, and together with his unflinching advocacy of the intolerant claims of the Papacy unfit him, in our judgment, for the position of advocate of the rights of conscience and freedom of worship, as now announced by him."

For these reasons they protested against allowing Cardinal Moran a seat in the Federal Convention. But were they equally anxious that no Protestant ecclesiastic should be allowed the same privilege? Not at all; they had no anxiety whatever on that point. Nor were they anxious that religion should be kept out of the provisions of the Constitution by which the Federation is to be governed, for it was expressly urged by a "Council of Churches"—Protestant churches, of course—that the Constitution should contain certain provisions of a religious character. They secured petitions to this end and sent them to the Convention. All they were afraid of was that by the election of Cardinal Moran to a seat in the Convention, some of his religion might get embodied in the Constitution in the place of their own. The Echo comments as follows:—

"This is all very well as applied to Cardinal Moran, and bears out the predictions already made that his appearance on the political field would arouse sectarian strife and religious controversy and opposition. And it is doubtless well that it should, remembering what the investors with civil authority, of cardinals, popes, and religious ecclesiastics, has resulted in in the past.

"But there is a principle involved here which is broader than Cardinal Moran, or even the Roman Catholic Church. If it is impossible to separate the person of Francis Patrick Moran from the position he occupies in the Roman Catholic Church, it is just as impossible to separate the persons of Protestant ministers from the positions they occupy in their respective churches. And if Cardinal Moran's ecclesiastical position excludes him from the right to meddle with politics, so does the like position occupied by Protestant ministers also exclude them from the same.

"Cardinal Moran has as much right to enter politics as have Protestant ministers. He has as much right to seek to introduce religion into civil affairs as have the ministers who compose the Council of Churches. He has as much right to seek through law to establish the supremacy of the Roman pontiff as head of the church in the place of Jesus Christ, as have any number of Protestant ministers to attempt, by the same means, to establish the Sunday sabbath in the place of the Sabbath of the Bible; for both are alike religious dogmas and therefore ruled out of the rightful domain of civil government, and both are alike unscriptural and of the Roman Catholic Church.

"There can be no escape from the logic of this argument. A thing is not wrong because done by a man professing the Roman Catholic faith. It is wrong, if wrong at all, because it is wrong in principle. Let not this be forgotten. A wrong principle followed will lead Protestants astray just as truly as it will Roman Catholics. Name and profession count for nothing here. Principles operate the same the world over.

"Therefore, we say that such a protest as the one above quoted, while good in itself, can come with consistency and with good grace only from those religionists who themselves let politics severely alone, and who oppose, with all their might all attempts to unite Church and State through the introduction of any religious questions whatsoever into civil affairs. Let Protestants see to it that they are consistent and truly Protestant."
