The executive committee of the "California State Sabbath Association" recently met and passed a resolution to the effect that Sunday concerts, illustrated Sunday lectures, etc., are a violation of the holy law of the Sabbath, which requires all people to spend the whole day 'in the public and private exercises of God's worship, except so much as is to be taken up in the works of necessity and mercy.'"

We wonder what "holy" Sabbath law can be referred to here. We know of but one holy Sabbath law—the fourth commandment—and that says nothing about spending the day in "the public and private exercises of God's worship, except so much as is to be taken up in the works of necessity and mercy." The quotation reads like some old Puritan regulation of colonial times. Whether this or not, it is a mere human statute, and to designate it as "the holy law of the Sabbath," is nothing short of blasphemy.
