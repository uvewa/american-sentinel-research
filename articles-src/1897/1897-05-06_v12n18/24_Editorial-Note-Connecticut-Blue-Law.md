A SUNDAY measure of themost pronounced Blue-law type is reported as having passed the House of the Connecticut legislature, April 22. It provides that no labor or sport should be allowed in the State between sunrise and sunset on Sundays, and fixes a penalty of $50 for violation of its provisions. One noticeable feature of it is that it specifies that no exception shall be made for persons who observe the seventh day as the Sabbath. Doubtless this latter provision most fully embodies the real spirit of the measure.

The press report states that should the provisions of this bill be strictly construed, they "would stop the electric cars and stages, and would make it unlawful to ride out in carriages or on bicycles or to go boating, fishing or swimming."
