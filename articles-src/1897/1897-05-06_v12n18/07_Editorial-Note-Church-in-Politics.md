A writer in *The Kingdom*, of January 29, laments that the Church is so lethargic in political matters, and says that "it must be made to understand how far short it has come of doing its full duty in political and municipal matters." In this he voices the sentiment of many who pose to-day as religious teachers.

How strange it is, from this standpoint, that the Saviour, in his great commission which sets forth what should be the work of his followers in the world, never even hinted at the important duties they would have in connection with politics! Was this an oversight on the part of the Lord?
