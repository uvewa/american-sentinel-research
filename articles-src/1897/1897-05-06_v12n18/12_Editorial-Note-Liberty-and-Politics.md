When both plutocrats and socialists are heard invoking the name of Liberty in sanction of their principles and proceedings, as is heard to-day in this "land of freedom," one cannot but query whether the problem of conferring liberty upon "the people" is any nearer its solution to-day, by political methods, than it ever was in the past. The truth is that Christianity, not politics, holds the real and only solution; and in proportion as Christianity wanes in the lives of the people, liberty is lost.
