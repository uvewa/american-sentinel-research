It was recently reported that France had announced to the Powers, with reference to the war between Turkey and Greece, that unless the Sultan makes overtures of peace, she will "come forward as the defender of the Christian cause." Does this mean that the Christian cause has suffered defeat? If not, why must France come to its rescue?

The outcome of the war illustrates the folly of the idea that the cause of Christianity can be represented by an earthly government with its troops and vessels of war. Any such government is liable to defeat, as has been the fortune of Greece; but can Christianity be defeated? If it can, then there is a power in existence that is stronger than God; for Christianity has its support in God.

The truth is Christianity is the manifestation of God in human flesh, just as He was in human flesh in the person of Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus was unconquerable; and God in human flesh is unconquerable to-day.

The Christian cause has no need of the assistance of France or of any other government. It never was and never can be defeated.
