**THE GODS OF THE NATIONS.**

If war were not in itself so wicked and the cause of world-wide suffering and bloodshed and moral degradation, the spectacle presented by armed Christendom would indeed be ludicrous. The old pagan contestants had each their special national gods, who were expected to help them. But modern "Christian" powers nominally look to the same God, each one severally confidence that their cause and ambitions are supported by Him. The Russians serve a God whose sympathies are supposed to be Russian, and so it is with all the list of militant forces, even down to the Khalifa who expects Allah to smite the infidels who are coming up the Nile. It is the old paganism; the difference is only in name and in the measure of the light sinned against by those who, having opportunity to know the true God, allow the "god of this world" to fill their hearts with hatred and jealousy and covetousness, which in turn are filling the world with violence.
