The Pilot, a prominent Catholic journal of Boston, Mass., in its issue of March 13, makes note of the bill before the Kansas legislature to incorporate the Ten Commandments into the code of that State, and says:—

"What about that [commandment] enjoining to 'keep holy the Sabbath day?' According to the Old Testament in which the Decalogue is to be found, the Sabbath day was Saturday. By authority of the Catholic Church of our Lord, that day has been changed from Saturday to Sunday without any sanction of the Old Testament. Wherefore, if the legislature of Kansas pass the proposed law, where will the citizens of the State be 'at,' in the event of trying to make men righteous by act of the legislature?"
