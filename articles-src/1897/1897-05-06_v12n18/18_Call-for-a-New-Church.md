## Call for a New Church.

A conference met April 16, at Scranton, Pa., in answer to a call which affirms that true reformers can no longer consistently condemn sinful and corrupt political parties while supporting and holding religious fellowship with the same political sinners in the church," and hence that "all Christians must come out" of the existing churches, which it asserts are "unfaithful to their Lord," and constitute only "thrice dead shells of official formalism."

The alleged necessity for this coming out is that "the need of the hour and of the age is an organization truly representing the kingdom of God to proclaim the message of salvation for the soul, for society and for the State;" and that "peace and prosperity with the blessing of Jehovah are to be found only in the universal application of the same moral standard to political and corporate acts that is applied to individual matters and relations."

This is only another indication that the spirit of the movement to combine religion with politics is in the very air. But it recognizes that the churches which contain the politicians of the day are so corrupt that all Christians must "come out" of them, and yet it sees no significance in the conjunction of this necessity with the fact that the churches are full of "political sinners."

The truth is that the churches, by going into politics, are getting more and more filled with the spirit of worldliness; and when this new organization goes into politics, as it must if its intentions are carried out, it will soon become as corrupt as any of the rest.

The church that will keep out of politics entirely, will keep pure.
