## Unchristian Advice to Endeavorers.

CERTAIN of the baseball clubs of the "National League" have announced that they will play games this season on Sunday. Whereupon certain leaders of "Christian Endeavor" have inaugurated a campaign against this proposed exhibition of "Sabbath desecration" which is outlined by the Rev. R. DeWitt Mallary, in a recent issue of the *Golden Rule*. He tells the Christians whom he addresses that "a great deal" may be done to stop this profanation of Sunday, in various ways. "Western Endeavorers," he exclaims, "stir up your sheriffs to execute the law in the cities where this unholy pleasuring violates the Sabbath and the spirit of American institutions. Eastern Endeavorers! when these profaners of the Sabbath, who so brazenly defy you and set at naught your holiest feelings, journey thither to play, let a 'righteous anger' rise up within you against the evil which they flaunt on their banner, and attend no game in which any of those clubs plays. . . . Let them receive a chilling reception at the hands of all Christians."

A number of queries are suggested by such an utterance. Why, for instance, should pleasuring be proceeded against by the sheriff because it is "unholy." Do human laws deal with actions on the basis of their character as holy or unholy? If not, why should the Sunday baseballists be interfered with for playing "unholy" games?

And if this kind of "unholy pleasuring" should be prohibited by law, why should not all other "unholy pleasuring" be likewise prohibited? Why, in short, should there not be laws against everything that is unholy, with sheriffs properly instructed to enforce them?

Again, what is there in a game of baseball on Sunday which constitutes a "brazen defiance" of a Christian Endeavorer, who from his profession may properly be supposed to be busy somewhere in Christian work or worship, far away from the place of worldly sports? The Sunday baseballist does not propose to interfere with the Christian Endeavorer, but the Christian Endeavorer proposes to interfere with the Sunday ball player and forbid him to engage on Sunday in his avocation from which he derives his living. Is this any less a defiance of the baseball player than his Sunday playing is a defiance of the Christian Endeavorer? And has a person any better right to defy another because he is a Christian Endeavorer, than he would have as a baseball player?

Again, what are the "holiest feelings" of Christian Endeavors supposed to be? Are they feelings which relate in some way to a game of baseball? We had not supposed this to be the case. We give them credit for a higher Christianity than that.

Again, why should Christians, and especially Christian Endeavors, give to another class of their fellow-beings a "chilling reception"? If they are exceptional sinners, as Sunday ball players are affirmed to be, should not Christians manifest even a warmer fellowship toward them than toward others, that they may, if possible, be won to Christ? If God and Christ do not give the sinner a "chilling reception," what business have Christ's professed followers—themselves sinners—to do so? God distinguishes between the sinner and the sin. Ought not God's children do as much for their fellow-mortals?

Mr. Mallary concludes his exhortation to the Endeavors with the words, "God make us *militant* Christians!" Militant against what? Against self and the sin that lurks in our own hearts? It seems not; but against our fellowmen, for the commission of what we consider their crimes! Militant by means of sheriffs and the civil law!—is this the warfare of the "church militant"? We think not.

This advice of Mr. Mallary's to the Christian Endeavors is in great need of revision.
