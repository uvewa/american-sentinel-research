# News, Notes, and Comment.

The progress of civilization in Europe, under the auspices of State religions, has been for many years accompanied by a steady increase in the size of armies and navies. These vast and costly organizations are maintained for the benefit of those who rule "by the Grace of God." Their business is to see that the people of each nation are not deprived of the inestimable blessing of rulers thus commissioned—to save the people from themselves, in case they should, at any time, become so demented as to imagine that they would be better off if they dispensed with the peculiar manifestation of divine beneficence called a "king" or "emperor;" to extend the particular "grace of God" which is represented by the banner of each nation over the people of another nation through force and violence, whenever the opportunity is afforded; and to prevent a similar extension of every "grace of God," which is symbolized by another battle-flag.

* * *

And this is all very well for Europe. Every country over there knows that it is right in whatever it does, and when a nation or a man knows what the right is, unquestionably the proper thing is to go ahead and do it. The way they find out what is right for a government to do is to consult the priesthood of the established church. Each nation has a State church of its own, and infallibility is one of the attributes inherent and necessary in a State Church. If the authorities feel uncertain as to the propriety of invading a neighbor's territory, murdering the inhabitants, and extending their boundary lines by stealing land, the State church is always on hand to dissipate their doubts. When she blesses the standards, and gives thanks for every massacre by her disciples, all is, of necessity, well and nobly done. And the other fellow has at hand the same wise and gracious counselor in his State church, so that he, too, knows exactly whether he is on the right side or the wrong one. Thus, war becomes a "holy" thing, is invested with the same spiritual charm that made the Crusaders so enjoy those little tussles in Palestine, and filled the Saracens with pious delight as they cut the throats of the invaders.

* * *

But the United States has no such guide, philosopher and friend as a national church. Hence, war seems to be, except as a defensive proceeding, altogether out of our line. It is admitted that setting out to rob and kill our fellow-man is a serious business, that the presumption is against the morality of the transaction, and that one ought to be very sure of its sanction by the highest authority, before embarking in any such enterprise. Now this assurance can never be ours, because, as stated, there is no national church to tell us as a nation that it is the will of Deity we should "move upon the works" of another State with fire and sword. Aggressive wars we are not equipped for; they form no part of our "mission;" if we had a million men and a thousand ships, we could never be certain that we were right in using them against others. The blessed certainty that rapine and murder will find favor in the eyes of the God of love can only be ours after we have complied with the wishes of those who clamor for Federal "recognition" of religion.

* * *

I am led into this train of thought by reading some items about the United States Navy. The writer congratulates himself on the fact that, at the Grant mausoleum ceremonies "we may have one ship of over 10,000 tons, possibly a second of over 9,000, a third of over 8,000, a fourth of over 7,000, and three others of over 6,000;" and he goes on to enumerate the vast number of "iron-clads," and "cruisers," and "torpedo boats," and all the rest of that ilk which we either possess already, or will possess as soon as the taxpayers' money can be squandered upon them. And he congratulates the citizens of this, our "Christian country," on the state of things which he so exultingly depicts.

* * *

The twenty, more or less, of devices for facilitating the taking of human life and the destruction of property which made up "the new United States Navy" are eyesores on the ocean. Whether as formidable or not, in the aggregate, as any navy of the "great powers," they cannot possibly be surpassed by the work of mere mortals for intense and complete repulsiveness of appearance. If for no other reason, because they are shocking to every one who cares to look on beautiful things, such as the white-winged sailors of the sea, they ought to be blown up, unless there are the strongest possible reasons of utilitarianism for keeping them afloat; and no more like them should ever be built. But, as a matter of fact, there is every practical reason for doing away with all such monsters forever.

* * *

There is probably no more utterly useless thing in existence than this United States Navy. It is even worse than useless. It is a source of great and permanent danger to this country and all of its truest interests. It brings us into constant contact with foreign nations under circumstances which could not be better calculated to bring on "a row" if they were expressly arranged for that purpose. Idle men are sent on long voyages around the world, having about them a sort of order of national sanctity, full of a silly sense of personal dignity utterly unwarranted as a rule by any special excellence of personal character, offensive in their conventional bearing, fondly fancying all slights or insults offered to their Lilliputian magnificence to be an affront against the majesty of a great country; and the miracle is, not that every now and then an international complication results, but that we do not have a new difficulty on our hands every day in the year.

* * *

AND this useless toy is dangerous in another way. "In time of peace, prepare for war." Never was advice offered more rotten at the core of its inspiration. It ought to read, "In time of peace, get ready for making war—and, as soon as you are ready, make it." There is no surer way in the world to bring on a war than to make preparations for it. Give a nation the consciousness that it is "able to whop anybody," and the desire to "whop" is continually present, the temptation to try to "whop" somebody is always alive and feverishly looking for an outlet to indulgence. The "jingo" of the United States finds the navy a continuous and violent stimulant to his perverted nervous impulses. He hates to see so much splendid material wasted. He says, as the writer of the above extract says, in effect: "Just see how many people we could kill at once, if we could only get at them; let us go and find them somewhere!"

* * *

THE NAVY is what, more than anything else, makes us ignore that wise advice of George Washington in his "Farewell Address to the American People"—that we should carefully and sedulously avoid all entanglements with foreign countries, their affairs, their difficulties and disputes, whether internal or external. He rightly considered that the United States was most fortunate in being so far away that European life and politics were not and could never, save by our own fault and intermeddling, become a matter of slightest concern to us. He foresaw the endless trouble and disaster that must accrue if we should throw away this tremendous national advantage. He knew there were domestic problems on our hands which more than one century would be required to solve, and that it was our sound course to deal with them alone. And he saw the demagogue's triumph in the "vigorous foreign policy."

* * *

AND it is true that the Navy, by kindling and feeding a spirit of hostility to all the rest of the world, helps the demagogue to distract the minds of the populace from the affairs of home administration. There is no surer way to divert the crowd, when the cry of "stop thief" sounds too close to the ear, than to have a "pal" start a fight on the corner. A knavish tariff, a corporation-dictated "settlement," costing the Government millions of dollars, a plundered treasury—what are all these things, if the "white squadron" can only be sent to bombard a city?
