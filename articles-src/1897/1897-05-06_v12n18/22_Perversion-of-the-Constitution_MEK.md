## Perversion of the Constitution.

BY M. E. KELLOGG.

When one protests very vigorously that such and such a thing is not so, when there is apparently no occasion for such a protest, it at once excites the suspicion that the protestor is liable to the implication of the very thing which he denies; since his own vehement protests are evidently thrust out as fenders to ward off a blow that he feels he is liable to receive. This may be seen in the continual protests and assertions that the proposed union of Christianity and the Government in this country is not a union of the Church with the State.

The pastor of the M. E. Metropolitan Church, of Washington, D. C., at which President McKinley worships, is one of these protestors, and the Sunday evening sermon subsequent to the inauguration, listened to by the President, was devoted to a presentation of the idea that Christianity united to the State is the ideal system, and that by such a union the Constitution is to be carried out! As we learn from the Christian Statesman, the discourse was from 2 Kings 11:12 and Rom. 13:1. We will give a few sentences from the synopsis of the sermon as given in the above named paper of April 3:—

"The Christian religion is the foundation of all law and literature, and to be hostile to the Christian religion is to be hostile to the Government in which we dwell. The Constitution provides that Congress shall make no law regulating the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; and that no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification for any office of public trust. These simply secure religious freedom and separation of the Church from the State. They are as a bill of rights, guaranteeing to all the churches full liberty, and forbidding Congress ever to abridge that liberty. It is not a union of Church and State, but the union of Christianity and the State, etc."

Never was there a more un-American and ridiculous statement made than that hostility to the Christian religion is hostility to the United States Government. Men were hostile to the Christian religion hundreds of years ago; were they therefore hostile to the United States Government? There are German and French infidels in their native countries; are they hostile to this Government? Washington declared in the treaty with Tripoli that this Government was not founded upon the Christian religion; how then can opposition to Christianity be classed as opposition to the Government?

This position supposes what is not true, that the United States Government and the Christian religion are identical in their scope and design; but they are as different as it is possible for two things to be. One is to save all mankind from sin and to make them holy and happy forever; the other is to conserve the civil rights of Americans; and that only in this life. Making sin against God to be the same as treason against the State is a perfect reproduction of the principles of the papacy. Precisely such teaching in the past has thrust the noblest men into prison, lighted burning piles round dissenters and filled the earth with martyrs. It deifies the State, and demands of every one who reads the words "Thou shalt have no other gods before me," to admit the government on an equality with the God he worships, as a part of his Deity.

Again: the reverend gentleman who voiced these sentiments in the ears of the President thinks that the object of the Constitution and of the Government which it creates is to serve the interests of the church or churches. To him the provisions of the Constitution are only a bill of rights, guaranteeing *to all the churches*'s full liberty and forbidding any abridgment of that liberty! Here again is another monstrous perversion of the Constitution. It is assumed that the Constitution considers only the rights of the churches! We have always supposed, and we appeal to history to sustain our contention, that the Constitution was instituted to maintain the rights, not of churches, nor of persons as members of churches, but of men as men. Freedom of men in religious things is the constitutional idea.

If it were not so painful it would be amusing to see how the same old relations that once existed between the papacy and the civil governments of the world are urged under other terms as the proper relations which should exist between this Government and a federation of the churches here. In the place of the "Holy Roman Church," they have Christianity, and in the place of "union" they now offer the word "coöperation." Let no one be deceived by this change of names and terms. The Catholic Church was the *name* of what passed for Christianity in the Middle Ages, full as much as the confederated churches pass for it now; and "coöperation" can only be attained by a practical union of these churches in their united capacity with the Government.

The enforcement of a religion common to all the churches has in it all the elements of danger that the enforcement of the religion of any one church or sect has. To those who are outside the pale of that religion, it is the same as Rome against the Waldenses; Prelacy against Quakerism; Puritan against Baptist. It is well that Romanism is by this presidential teacher taken as a part of the whole of the new national religion, though against the protests of the *Statesman*. As a mother of experience she can instruct her unsophisticated, but fast maturing, daughters in those arts of securing her ends by laws, which have been so successful in the past, albeit at the expense of liberty, and which have made all the world wonder after her. She is a great teacher, and it would seem that many are learning her teaching who should be learning from her history in the past the lesson of the great danger of ecclesiastical domination from coöperation with the State in the affairs of government.
