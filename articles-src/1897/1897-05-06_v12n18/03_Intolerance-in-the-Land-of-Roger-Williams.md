THE wave of Puritanism has invaded the historic land of Roger Williams, the apostle of religious liberty. The Providence (R. I.) Journal, of April 27, announced that "Next Monday night the City Council will be asked to pass a resolution prohibiting the use of boats on the lakes at Roger Williams Park, and to direct the Park Commissioners to discontinue the use of flying horses [merry-go-rounds] on the sabbath." The demand for this is made by Councilman T. W. Waterman, and is based upon several sections of Chapter 281 of the General Laws of Rhode Island, which prohibit all work and recreation on the first day of the week.

The Journal makes the observation that "after the expenditure of over $1,000,000 to improve and beautify the park, and provide amusement for the people, it is hardly likely that the taxpayers, who are to pay the bills, will relish this;" and adds that "it was argued by a few men, who talked the matter over yesterday, that nobody interfered with the rights of the Councilman from Ward 5 to attend church on Sunday as often as he pleased, and he had no right to interfere with people who, during the week, are compelled to work in shops and factories, and who on Sunday desired to enjoy a little recreation in the parks."

Of course the common people will not relish this, nor can it be supported by sound argument; but neither the wishes of the people nor sound argument are elements which enter into a wave of Puritanism.

The Journal adds that "if the move is being made for the purpose of compelling the people to go to church, it will be a dismal failure." That this is the purpose of all such moves is evident from the fact that they seek to prohibit every other form of occupation on Sunday except going to church. A person must do something, if he is not sick or asleep; and if he can neither work nor engage in sport or recreation, he will be almost driven to go to church. However, as a means of making people any better morally, mentally, or physically, the move will be a "dismal failure" beyond a doubt.
