Just as we expected, we are receiving orders for thousands of copies of our special Sentinel, of April 29. But knowing that the largest number of orders would be given after the paper had been read by our subscribers, we have planned so that all can secure copies in any quantities desired. Send in your orders. You will not be disappointed with the reply, "None left." While the matter will not soon grow old, it is better to order promptly. One dollar per hundred, eight dollars per thousand. Address, American Sentinel, 39 Bond St., New York.
