**THE** *Truth Seeker* (atheist organ), of April 24, says:—

"When we observe the political activity of ministers, when we note that they are turning their pulpits into rostrums for the advocacy of temporal reforms, when we hear them appealing from the gospel to the statute book, and from Christ to Caesar, we are justified in concluding that they are losing faith in the efficacy of religion as a power for reforming mankind."

Do the ministers and churches which are "appealing from the gospel to the statute book, and from Christ to Caesar," realize that by this they are putting an argument—and a very effective one—into the mouths of non-believers to be used against Christianity? Whether they realize it or not, that is what they are doing; and they will have an account to render for it at the bar of God.
