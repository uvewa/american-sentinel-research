"RIGHTEOUSNESS exalteth a nation," says the Scripture; but it does not follow that any man or set of men should try to exalt the nation through righteousness. Not the men, but the righteousness, is the exalting element; and righteousness comes only as it is imputed, through faith, to the individual. Let every man build 'over against his own house.'
