## Resist Not Evil.

*By Rev. W. J. Harsha, D. D., Pastor Second Collegiate Reformed Church, New York City.*

The bloody conflict between Turkey and brave little Greece is engaging the attention of the civilized world. There remains within the breast of the most highly developed individual a certain savage instinct which thrills in admiration of heroism in battle. Let there be half an excuse for war, and there will be found multitudes of people who will defend it. Let two men have a difference of opinion or a misunderstanding in business, and at once there is a resort to harsh language, to fistcuffs or to the courts. The human race is far from that millennium in which a treaty of arbitration shall be in force in all private and public brawls. The thirst for blood in us, as in the caged tiger, is not dead; it only sleepeth.

It is timely to remember and consider the words of Jesus, "Resist not evil." Count Tolstoi startled the world by insisting upon a literal application of this sentiment to everyday affairs. Christians had departed so far from the precepts of their Master that the Count's religion seemed new and indefensible. So far as his advocacy of non-resistance goes he has simply reminded us of one of the most important principles of the Sermon on the Mount.

Just what does non-resistance of evil mean? Certainly not that we should cultivate a mean and despicable spirit of soft acquiescence when we are kicked or defrauded. The Christian is not required to refrain from proper defence of self, property and loved ones. Manliness and dignity are not denied him. The manliest of all beings was his Master, whose resurrection we have just been celebrating.

Non-resistance implies a desire to suffer rather than to strike, to take abuse rather than to abuse, to bear patiently in order that the offender may be ashamed. Of Jesus it is said, "When he was reviled he reviled not again:" He did not answer cruel words with cruel words. There was in His heart no determination to "get even" at all hazards. This is the fault of the present. A practical *lex talionis* is still in force. The United States Senate is bound to get even with the President in political affairs. The member of the Church of Christ is determined to get even with the fellow-member when a wrong has been done or a slight given. Too much have we forgotten the saying, "If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink, for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head."

We may not all go forth to battle, but we may all show real heroism in the home. No house so small, no flat so poor, no tenement so dark but it may be illumined by the light of generous love. Forgive that thou mayest be forgiven. Show thyself strong and Christ-like by holding back the ready blow, by checking the quick, hot answer of wrath. Euclid, the great mathematician, once offended his brother, who cried, "May I die if I be not avenged against you one day or another!" To which Euclid replied, "And may I die if I do not soften you by my kindness and bring you to love me again." This is the practical Christian principle which shall live long after the Turkish Empire has become a thing of the past.
