**THAT WEST POINT CONTROVERSY.**

**SECRETARY** of War Alger has made the following statement of the policy that has been decided on by the War Department with reference to the erection of church buildings on the military reservation at West Point:—

"Much has been said about the building of a Catholic chapel on the grounds of the United States Military Academy at West Point. This was a privilege accorded these people by my predecessor, who said that similar privileges would be accorded to others. You can state that any other denomination desiring to build a chapel on the grounds upon the same conditions will be given an equally advantageous site for the building. No favoritism will be shown to any denomination, and others will be accorded a site equally as good as that of the Catholic chapel."

This decision seems to be a fair one, and will certainly be pointed to as such by the Roman Catholics. But its practical effect is to put the latter in full possession of the field of battle; and this, not on account of what the Catholics have done, but of what Protestants have done themselves. A brief statement of facts will enable the reader to appreciate the situation.

As noticed recently in these columns, the New York Conference of the M. E. Church, at its session in Sing Sing, last April, passed a resolution protesting against the permission granted the Roman Catholics to erect a chapel at West Point, declaring that such permission was "contrary to the well-established principles of our Government"; and in connection with the same they were reminded by one of their number, Rev. J. P. Hermance, that the like privilege had long been sought in vain by the Methodist Church, and that the Catholics were only following Methodist example.

Following this, the late Presbyterian Ministers Conference in Philadelphia passed this resolution:—

"WHEREAS, This permission [to erect a chapel] had been extended to the Roman Catholic church; and, whereas, it was plainly in contravention of the Constitution of the United States to have so closely allied the Church and the State;

Resolved, That the present Secretary of War, General Russell A. Alger, be requested forthwith to rescind such permission and prevent the erection of the church."

And now comes the decision of Secretary Alger, that all denominations are to be treated alike, by giving to each the privilege of erecting a church on the reservation any time that it desires to do so.

As stated, this seems a fair method of settling the controversy, and is such, from the standpoint occupied by some of the parties in it. But the Methodist and Presbyterian churches have just protested against the thing which the Secretary of War has decided to allow, declaring it to be an alliance of "the Church and the State," and "contrary to the well-established principles of our Government"; how then can they avail themselves of the generous permission which the Government has granted in the matter? And how can any other Protestant church, in the face of such action by two of the leading Protestant bodies of the land, take advantage of the same permission?

It is a clear and decisive victory for Rome. And it comes from a "bad example" set by Protestants,—that is, from an espousal by the latter of Roman Catholic principles and methods.

And this is only a sample of what is going on all over the land, in the shape of efforts on the part of "Protestants" to persuade or compel the civil powers to grant them favors. Most noticeably is this true in the matter of legislation for the observance of Sunday. And it is all working to the same result that followed in the West Point fiasco—a clear victory for Rome. In the nature of things, no other result is possible.

No one understands all this better than Rome herself; and she may be relied on to take full and speedy advantage of the situation.
