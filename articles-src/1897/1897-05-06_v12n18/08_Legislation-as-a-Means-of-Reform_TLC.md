## Legislation as a Means of Reform.

In the N. Y. Independent, of April 15, that well-known Christian writer, Rev. Theo. L. Cuyler, makes the following pertinent observations upon the reasons for the present status of the cause of temperance reform, strongly deprecating the idea that there is a panacea for the drink evil in legislation. Dr. Cuyler discerns the dangerous fallacy which is embodied in the current popular theory as to the proper means for securing moral reform, and his words sound a timely signal of warning. (In part) he says:—

"After half a century of honest hard work against the terrible drink curse, I feel perfectly sure that to place our main reliance on any kind of legislation, however stringent, is a fatal mistake. There is a prodigiously prevalent idea in our country that legislation is the great panacea for a large portion of the evils that afflict society. The cardinal error of the Populists is that Government is a parental institution; that it ought to run all the railways and telegraphs, that it ought to loan money to the people, that it ought to provide a market for the silver and to provide flat money in unlimited abundance, etc., etc.

"It is a kindred delusion of some of my well-meaning Prohibitionist brethren that legislation is in itself the cure-all for the innumerable woes of strong drink. They preach nothing else, labor for nothing else, and denounce unsparingly other honest advocates of temperance who decline to look at this great question through their knothole, and to pronounce their shibboleth. They strangely ignore the lamentable facts: that there is (for various reasons) an enormous use of intoxicants; that this enormous use creates an enormous demand; and this enormous demand it is which produces the enormous sale of intoxicants. To attempt to prohibit the sale while nothing is done to diminish the use and demand for intoxicants, is as preposterous as to attempt to stop the flow of Niagara by throwing a dam of bulrushes across the face of the cataract.

"Suppose that all the pulpits, all the schools, and all the parents should cease to teach the sinfulness of theft; could there be a police large enough to protect all our property? Against the deadly drink itself, and not solely against the sale of it, our unceasing warfare must be waged.

"It must never be forgotten that the original Maine Law of 1851—in which I thoroughly believe, and in defense of which I have made hundreds of public speeches—was the outcome of a long and widespread agitation, in pulpit, press and popular meetings, against all intoxicants. The drink customs were fought against, and the popular conscience was aroused. In Neal Dow's phrase "the whole State was sowed knee-deep with temperance literature." And the experience of the last forty-six years has proved that where moral efforts have been kept up, and where the popular conscience has been awake and active, the prohibitory law has produced most beneficial results.

"Wherever the people have been lulled into the delusion that the law would enforce itself, wherever moral efforts have not prevented large numbers of people from wanting to drink intoxicants, wherever 'drinking clubs' have been organized, and wherever the politicians have made a football of the righteous law, the curse of drunkenness has come back again. . . .

"Legislation to prohibit liquor selling without moral efforts to diminish liquor drinking fails, and will fail to the end of time. Iniquitous and destructive as are the saloons, a large portion of the drinking does not begin there, or even end there. The bottle is in innumerable homes and clubs and restaurants and social gatherings; and as long as the drink is in such demand the traffic in the drink will go on. Short cuts to great moral revolutions have never succeeded; legislation on paper will never dam up torrents of evil as long as the fountain heads of evil remain unchecked. It has been truly said a thousand times that legal action without moral effort is a bird with only one wing; it cannot fly.

"What next? In the face of all the facts from Maine and Iowa and Vermont and New Hampshire and Kansas shall there be no other tocsin sounded than that of "Prohibition"? After twenty-five years of gallant struggle the political Prohibition Party was able to poll only 135,000 votes at the late Presidential election, about 100,000 less than it polled four years before. Shall all the time and money and eloquence and efforts of the friends of temperance be expended in that single direction? If so, the temperance reform is doomed. Back of the "saloons" lie the drink customs; back of the traffic lies the demand for intoxicants; legislation unaided by moral effort is powerless to stay the destructive plague.

"In the early days of the temperance reform we fought the drink evil by vigorous work in the churches, in the pulpits, in the schoolhouses, in the homes; we fought the drink itself. We educated people to total abstinence by solid arguments—medical, moral, social, economical and religious arguments. We have got to educate them again. Not long ago Francis Murphy spent thirty days in Boston preaching total abstinence, and the arrests for drunkenness were 268 the less during that month! Great numbers signed a pledge of abstinence from the drink. Similar efforts elsewhere will produce similar results.

"What next? Others may answer this question as they choose: but my answer, as a lifelong teetotaler and foe of the diabolical liquor traffic, is, Let us have a fresh education against the deadly evils of the drinking customs. Christ's churches are neglecting this; Sunday-schools are neglecting this too much; parents are neglecting this; temperance societies have largely disbanded; moral efforts are dying out; and fearfully are we paying for this wretched policy. Instead of the idle and easy shout, "The saloons must go!" suppose we make an immense effort, in God's strength, to keep people from going to the saloons or anywhere else to buy intoxicants. *Stopping the use is the true way to stop the sale.* Our substantial victories in the past have been won on those lines; they can be won again; and they will be when parents and patriots and Christians all awake to their manifest duty."
