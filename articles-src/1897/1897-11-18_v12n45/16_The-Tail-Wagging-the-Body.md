"Four hundred and fifty barbers wanted Sabbath, fifty refused; fifty made four hundred and fifty work. Think that out." So says a writer in *The Defender*, the organ of the "New England Sabbath Protective League."

If this were true,—that "fifty made four hundred and fifty work,"—it would be an instance of the tail being successful in an effort to wag the body. But no such thing as this ever happened. It is contrary to nature and to reason. The alleged fact is not true.

The four hundred barbers who worked because the fifty others would not rest, did not want to lose their Sunday trade unless the other fifty also lost theirs.

Their own covetousness made them work. They worked because they thought more of their gains than of the weekly rest. The love of money, and not the fifty barbers, was their master.

Take the love of money away, and there is no foundation left for the oft-made assertion that "the right of rest for one is the law of rest for all." "The love of money is the root of all evil."
