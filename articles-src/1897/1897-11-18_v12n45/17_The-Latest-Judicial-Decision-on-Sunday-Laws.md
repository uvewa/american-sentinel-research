A FRIEND has kindly favored us with a copy of the *Alamosa* (Col.) *Independent-Journal*, of October 14, which contains a decision given by Judge Holbrook in the District Court of Costilla County, Col., on October 12, which is worthy of note as an addition to the list of judicial decisions touching upon the question of the validity of Sunday legislation. While this question was only incidentally involved in the present case, the language of the judge in considering it amounts to a virtual decision upon the validity of Sunday laws.

The case was that of the people of the State of Colorado against J. W. Palmer, for keeping open a saloon on the first day of the week. The decision says:—

"The information in this case charges the defendant with a violation of the statute which forbids the keeping open of saloons on the first day of the week.

"The defendant moves to quash the information, and by the motion the Sabbath question is involved.

"The Bible most positively declares that the seventh day is the Sabbath: the law books declare 'the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday,' to be the Sabbath.

"This conflict of authority between God and man, one phase of the motion to quash the information virtually calls on the court to decide. But, fortunately for the court, God has never required nor authorized man to punish his fellow man for a failure to observe the Sabbath, nor for neglect of any other religious duty; while men, jealous of their own works, have made laws to enforce the observance of the man-made Sabbath.

"The oath of a judge can go only to the extent of requiring the court to enforce the laws which men have made; leaving each individual, who wishes to do so, to worship God according to the requirements of the Bible, so far as the laws of man will permit.

"The defendant contends that the statute in question is obnoxious to Art. 2, Sec. 4, of the Constitution, which provides, 'That the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination, shall forever hereafter be guaranteed.' . . . 'Nor shall any preference be given by law to any religious denomination or mode of worship;' and also to the constitutional prohibition against special and class legislation.

"Generally, such a statute should be construed as obnoxious to both these constitutional provisions. Ordinarily a law which for religious reasons closes the doors of one business house on certain days, while another is permitted to run, is class legislation; and a law which requires the Jew, the Seventh-day Baptist, and the Seventh-day Adventist to cease their daily avocations on the first day of the week, is certainly a discrimination against religious worship, and is showing a preference to the religious denominations that keep the Sabbath which had its origin in the compromise between Christianity and paganism in the fourth century. Yet, it must be admitted that the sentiment of the people in favor of stringent Sunday laws has greatly increased within the last fifty years, and it must be further admitted that within the last twenty-five years courts of last resort have found reasons for sustaining Sunday laws, unknown to earlier decisions; however, the license laws of Colorado are such as to make further discussion of these constitutional provisions unnecessary in this case. The saloon business is a prohibited business, permitted only upon the obtaining of a license therefor, granted upon the filing of a bond conditioned for a strict observance of the statutes.

"It must be conceded that the state has a right to limit the license which it grants in such cases, and to punish for a violation of the law under which such license is granted.

"These objections as well also as the objections to the form of the information are found not well taken, wherefore it is ordered that said motion be and it hereby is overruled.

"CHAS. C. HOLBROOK.
"Judge."
