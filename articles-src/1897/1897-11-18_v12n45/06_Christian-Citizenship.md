To his followers Jesus said (and still says): "If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you." John 15:19. Christianity means separation from the world; and Christian citizenship cannot possibly mean anything less.
