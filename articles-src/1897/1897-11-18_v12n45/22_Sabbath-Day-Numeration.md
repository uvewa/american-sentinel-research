When God instituted the Sabbath day, he set it apart from the other days of the week. But if seventh-day observers can, as is often suggested to them by their would-be friends, begin with Monday in their numeration of the days of the week, so as to bring the seventh day on Sunday, there would be no force in the fact that the Sabbath day was set apart from the other days. For if it is proper to begin with Monday in counting the days of the week, it is equally proper to begin with Tuesday, and so bring the seventh, or Sabbath, day upon Monday; or begin with Wednesday, and bring the Sabbath day upon Tuesday; and so on through all the days of the week, making any one of them the Sabbath. But if each of them can be made the Sabbath, it certainly cannot be that any one of them is set apart from all the others.

The only safe and sensible way is to take God's numeration of the days, which begins the week with the day that we call Sunday. And that fixes a definite seventh day for the Sabbath.
