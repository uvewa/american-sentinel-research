An example in theological mathematics: Given, 1 rest day following 6 days of work, 1 commandment to keep holy "the seventh day," and 0 Scripture statements commanding the observance of any other day, to find 1 or more proofs that Sunday is the true Sabbath and ought to be made obligatory upon all persons by law. To solve this problem so as to obtain this result is the test of your orthodoxy.
