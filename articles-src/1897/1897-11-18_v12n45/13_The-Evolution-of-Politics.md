It would appear that in the evolution of American politics a point has been reached where the personality of a candidate for a position of public trust is altogether a secondary consideration, the thing of primary importance being allegiance to party organization. This much was plainly stated by one of the foremost politicians of the country in a speech made just previous to the late election. He said:—

"Every Republican should remember his duty. It doesn't make any difference about persons or if the candidate don't suit you exactly. The Republican organization must have the same discipline as we had in the regular army, when the boys in blue marched with their gallant leaders. As chairman of the Republican National Committee, I have the right to command, and you must stand by me in the dual position I now occupy.

"It doesn't matter whether you like my personality or not. I have no patience with the man who bolts his party because he is not satisfied with the candidate. If you expect business men to take part in politics and come among you, it is your duty to submit with the discipline of the party."

The loyal voters of to-day, therefore, will not "bolt" their party because it happens to nominate Benedict Arnold instead of George Washington for the highest position in the gift of the people, or Boss Tweed instead of Abraham Lincoln. Like the men of the famous "Light Horse Brigade," it will be—

> "Theirs not to make reply
> Theirs not to reason why."

but simply to do the bidding of their party commander—to act their part as cogs connecting the wheels of the political "machine." This will require servility, but no brains.

Party "machine" politics fosters neither intelligence nor patriotism. And such politics represents the "survival of the fittest"—in this case the unfittest—in the evolution of politics to-day.
