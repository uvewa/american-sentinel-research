NOTWITHSTANDING the many attempts to bolster up the Sunday by arguments from Scripture that could be true only when they are advanced in favor of the seventh day, it is a fact that that day is a spurious institution.

No stronger argument to prove this is needed than the statement recently made by Rev. Dr. Burrell at the State Convention of Christian Endeavor held in Paterson, N. J. The "reverend doctor" said, "My right to Sabbath observance depends upon a law for Sabbath observance for all. If others don't keep it, I can't."

In making this statement, he was making a plea in behalf of Sunday, looking to a state law enforcing its observance.

Had Sunday been a day of divine origin, Dr. Burrell would never have been under the necessity of making such a confession.

In an article last week, with reference to the seventh day, the writer showed that it is the sign of God's power in creation and redemption, and that in the very nature of things that day—the true Sabbath—is an aid to faith. It points one to the eternal power and divinity of Christ, and he who knows that power can keep the Sabbath.

But however closely we may examine Dr. Burrell's statement quoted above, we shall find an utter absence of anything like faith; and for the simple reason that there is nothing in the day to inspire faith. The truth is, not having any strength of its own, it is responsible for the weakness and spiritual poverty that is so prevalent in the Christian church of to-day.

For centuries it has been, as it were, a cancerous growth, a deadly gangrene, slowly but surely eating its way into the very life of Christendom, until now the church finds itself utterly helpless, and, having no "thus saith the Lord" for its support, turns abjectly to the state for aid. It is a viper that in an evil hour was clasped to the bosom of the church, and there being nourished and given warmth, it now darts its poisonous fangs into its benefactor, its virus spreading throughout the body; but instead of throwing the deadly thing off and fleeing to the Great Physician for healing, she deliriously hugs it more closely to her breast and, through state law, seeks to give it the fullest opportunity to sting her to death.

Nor could we expect it to be anything else, when we come to study the origin of Sunday. Its very name indicates its origin—the day of the sun.

Of all the religions that have been the rivals of the religion of Jesus Christ, that of sun-worship has been the most widespread and influential. And of all systems of worship that have been debasing and obscene, that have served to stamp out of the human heart all traces of Him who created man, sun worship has been the worst.

No one can read the history of sun-worship without a feeling of abhorrence for the vile rites that were practiced in connection with it.

One does not always have at his command the various books that treat on this subject, but he does have the Bible for reference. And any one who will read the 8th chapter of Ezekiel will see how the Lord regards sun-worship. Over and over again the Lord tells Ezekiel to look in a certain direction, and, as he does so, each time the command is, "Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations." The climax of all the abominations referred to in the chapter is reached in the 16th verse: "And he brought me into the inner court of the Lord's house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the Lord, and their faces toward the east; and they worshiped the sun toward the east."

Nor is it in the Scripture alone that God shows his abhorrence of sun-worship. When ancient Israel were encamped in the wilderness, the tabernacle was always pitched with the entrance toward the east, so that the people would face the west in their worship of God, and thus their backs be turned to the east. This was done with direct reference to sun-worship. He who worshiped the sun must first have turned his back upon God.

Sun-worship was the prevailing worship even in the apostles' days, and the student of the Bible and history will readily see that it was to this evil and its attendant horrors that Paul referred in Eph. 5:11,12: "And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret."

In the time of the apostles, Satan saw that nothing could openly withstand the onward march of Christianity. He therefore plotted to overthrow it in a different way, and the worst enemy that he purposed using in accomplishing this task were the so-called friends of Christianity.

The spirit-filled apostle could easily see the workings of Satan, and faithfully warned the believers of them. Thus he says to the elders at Ephesus, "Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them." Acts 20:30.

Again, in his letter to the Thessalonians (2 Thess. 2:3,4) Paul, correcting a wrong idea that had crept into the church relative to the second coming of Christ, says: "Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God." He then adds, "The mystery of lawlessness (R.V.) doth already work."

No one can doubt that this "man of sin," "the son of perdition," is any other than the power known as the papacy. The papacy is indeed the mystery of iniquity, the very incarnation of lawlessness. And the crowning work of this apostate power was the attempt to change God's holy law with reference to the Sabbath. It "has substituted the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for the observance of the seventh day—a change for which there is no scriptural authority." The papacy openly boasts of this, and points to it as the badge or mark of its authority, thereby confessing itself capable of doing no greater work.

In this act, and this only, has it exalted itself above all that is called God, for it claims to have done that which God could not possibly do—that is, to have made the first day of the week the Sabbath.

Sabbath means rest. Sabbath day means the day of God's rest. It is true that God worked six days and rested upon the seventh, but he could just as easily have worked five days and rested upon the sixth, or he could have done it all in one day and rested the second; but God could not possibly work upon the first day and call it his rest day.

Certainly, then, if the papacy could really do that which God could not possibly do, it would be greater than God, hence Sunday, as a Sabbath day, would stand for a power greater than God's power.

The power of the papacy has always been arrayed against the gospel of Jesus Christ. It confesses to knowing nothing of the faith of Jesus Christ for justification. From first to last, always and only, it is antichristian; therefore the day—Sunday—which is the badge, the mark of her authority, is itself antichristian. Sunday being antichristian, there is nothing in it that could possibly inspire faith. It is no better than the power that made it. It could be upheld by no other power than that which made it; and the power which the papacy ever used was the power of the state.

Therefore, while it is a sad confession on the part of the Rev. Dr. Burrell, it is perfectly logical that he and those who stand with him should appeal now to the state for help.
