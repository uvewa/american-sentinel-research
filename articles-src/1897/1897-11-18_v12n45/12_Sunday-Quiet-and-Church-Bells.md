In connection with the agitation now in progress in Washington, D. C., for the suppression of the crying of Sunday newspapers, the Washington Post offers the suggestion that the proposed prohibition of Sunday noise might quite consistently be extended so as to include Sunday ringing of church bells. The Post lays down the proposition that church bells are not at all essential to public worship, and had their origin not in public necessity but in the practices of barbarism. We know of no facts which contradict this statement. The Post says:—

"If the newsboys can ply their trade without crying their wares, surely the church can go upon its excellent and useful way without all this deafening and discordant clamor. The bell is of even less necessity in religion than public outcry is in newspaper vending. It is, in fact, a relic of antiquity, not to say semi-barbarism. It was first used by the Romans to summon the people to the public baths. Two centuries passed before bells were applied to church purposes. They were used in many ways, and were never, until very recently, regarded as an appliance of the church exclusively. They summoned the soldiers to arms, the tribunes to the Senate, the rabble to the circus. They sounded the alarm of conflagrations and of tumults."

It is not absolute quiet that the church wants on Sunday, but only such a degree of quiet as will exist when the church bells are given a monopoly in the production of sounds to attract the attention of the people. And for a like reason Sunday business is condemned and Sunday sports—they take the attention of the people away from the church and religious services.

On the ground that Sunday ought to be made a day of quiet by the suppression of all unnecessary noise, we do not see that any good reason can be given for drawing the line so as to exempt the noise of the ringing of the church bells.
