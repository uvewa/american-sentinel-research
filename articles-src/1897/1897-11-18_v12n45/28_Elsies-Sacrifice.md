> "With blue, cold hands and stockingless feet,
> Wandered a child in a cheerless street;
> Children were many, who—"

"Do tell me, mama, what made any one ever write such a sad story as that. I never saw any little child without shoes and stockings in the winter time," said Elsie stopping in the middle of her song, and fixing two brown, questioning eyes upon her mother.

Elsie Brown had lived on a farm all her life, among the flowers and trees, chickens and turkeys, and she had no idea of life in any other conditions than those found at the large, quaint farmhouse, with its clambering vines and clustering roses in summer, and its spacious cellar, stored with bushels and bushels of luscious, red-cheeked apples in winter. She thought it strange that children should wander around in the street when they were cold and hungry.

"Why didn't the children in the song go home, mama? That's what I can't see," said Elsie, with a decisive nod.

"I don't suppose you can quite understand it, dear," said Mrs. Brown, "for God has kindly given you a good home and plenty to eat and wear. Indeed, the 'lines have fallen unto you in pleasant places,' as the psalmist says."

Elsie had one very grave fault: she was extremely selfish. It was hard to induce her to part with any of her toys or books to those less favored of her mates, and her mother feared that this trait was growing stronger and stronger every day.

"Yes, Elsie," continued her mother, taking the child upon her lap, "you have no idea of the suffering of thousands of poor, homeless children, without food enough or clothes enough for their poor little starved bodies. And, my child, many of these little waifs work hard all day long for only a few pennies; and sometimes even this little is taken by cruel parents to buy drink."

"I should think some one would help them, mama, and get food for them."

"There are missions, my child; but they all cost a great deal, and people are apt to be very selfish, you know."

"I suppose so," said Elsie, blushing. She could not help thinking of the big, round dollar, which to her was a great deal of money, and which she had carefully saved to buy the beautiful dolly which was in Mr. Smith's window, over at the village.

"Then you know, dear," continued Mrs. Brown, "there are poor people right around here. There is Mrs. Simons, who has been very ill, and who is so old and poor, and you know there is no one to care for her but little Mabel, her grandchild."

"Oh, yes; Mabel comes to school sometimes; but she has shoes and stockings, mama," said Elsie, trying hard to quiet the voice of conscience.

"I guess if my little daughter will think carefully, she will remember that the poor little toes were peeping through the shoes, and that the dress was threadbare and thin."

"Well, I don't suppose it's expected that we help people unless they are awful poor, and don't have any shoes and stockings at all," protested Elsie, in whose mind visions of the beautiful doll with the big blue eyes that would shut, and the real hair, would intrude.

Mrs. Brown saw that the child had something very serious on her mind, and she hoped that selfishness would not win the battle, which she felt sure was on this point.

"Do you suppose, mama, that just a little bit of money, just what a little girl like me has, would help any one so very much?" she questioned, cautiously, earnestly hoping that her mother would agree with her that a little girl's money would be of no use. But much to Elsie's dismay, her mother replied that a "little girl's money might save a little girl's life."

This was decisive. The battle was fought and won. If it was possible that she might save little Mabel Lee's life, or her poor grandmother's either, she certainly did not have the heart to refuse even her cherished dollar.

"Well, mama, my old dolly is real nice yet; of course one eye is out and one leg off, and her hair is thin; but then,—I can make lovely dollies out of corn-cobs; Jennie Tray taught me how; and—yes, mama, I'll do it! I'm going to give my money to buy food and shoes and things for poor Mabel Lee and her grandma. Now don't let me back out, mama!"

"I'm so glad that the right has conquered this time, Elsie. I thought you would yield. You shall go over to the village this afternoon with papa and me, and we will buy some necessary comforts for the poor, whom Christ says we have always with us, that they may have a thanksgiving as well as we."

Elsie resolutely closed her eyes that afternoon when she passed the beautiful doll in the window, and thought of her little song about the stockingless feet.

Thanksgiving morning Elsie and her mother stopped at the door of the poor old lady, with their store of good things. There were apples and potatoes and a dozen big squashes and other treasures from Mr. Brown's large farm, and O how happy Elsie felt, as she unwrapped a big, brown bundle and handed little Mabel a nice pair of warm shoes and stockings!

O what a thanksgiving was kept in the poor little house! but it seemed to Elsie that she was happier than she had ever been in her life, and she could perfectly understand that which had always been so hard before for her to comprehend; the words of the merciful Saviour: "It is more blessed to give than to receive."
