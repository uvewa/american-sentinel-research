The terrible results of religious persecution appear not only directly in the temporary tortures of the oppressed, but often indirectly, and for a long after period, in the reactions and excesses which those persecutions provoke in the survivors or descendants of the unfortunates originally persecuted. Thus in Russia the fierce fanaticism of the Raskolniki sect, who have been practising self-immolation to such a horrible extent, believing as they do in the doctrine of salvation by martyrdom, is ascribed, probably with truth, to the cruel treatment the ancestors of these dissenters have undergone for generations, thousands of them having under the Empress Sophia been knouted by the state. So rigorously exclusive are the members of one branch of the Raskolniki sect, called the Beguni, says the Sun, that they will not eat or drink from the same utensils used by relatives who have married ordinary members of the Raskolniki. They will not worship in churches or buildings used by others, but only in caves and cellars, which are usually filthy beyond description. Their services are conducted in closely guarded secrecy.
