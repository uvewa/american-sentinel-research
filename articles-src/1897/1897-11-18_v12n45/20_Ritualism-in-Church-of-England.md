The growth of ritualism in the Church of England is illustrated in a very curious way by the story of the luncheon given at the opening of the new schoolroom at St. Oswald's College, Elsmere. This is under the control of the Anglican Bishop of Lichfield, and the day for opening was fixed for October 22. It appears to have been forgotten that that would be Friday; but it would not do to have a mere fish luncheon, and accordingly, with the invitation to his Grace the Duke of Westminster and other distinguished visitors and donors to the college, there was induced a slip on which it was stated that "the Bishop of Lichfield, who was consulted by the Provost, has given his dispensation from the obligations of the day to those who may desire it." That is, the Bishop tells his Grace and other visitors that if they will go to the opening of the schoolroom they will have an indulgence to eat freely of ham sandwiches and chicken salad. And this is modern Protestantism!
