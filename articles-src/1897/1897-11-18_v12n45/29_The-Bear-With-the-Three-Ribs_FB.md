"What about the second beast, Charlie? I see you are all ready to begin."

"And, behold, another beast, a second, like unto a bear," read Charlie.

"That will do for the present. What have you found out about bears?"

"The bear is inferior to the lion. There is a kind of nobility about a lion that is not found in the bear. When a lion has satisfied his hunger, he will leave his food for another time without moiling it over; but a bear is a spoiler and will muss over what is left. The bear hugs or tears his victim to death. There seems to be some redeeming quality in bears though, as the cubs can be tamed and trained."

"You have told enough to illustrate the value of the symbol of the second kingdom that was to be like a bear. History brings out the fact that the second kingdom was inferior to the first. The Medes and Persians had a great deal of trouble with Babylon, and had to reconquer it. When it was captured the second time, they proposed to tear down its beautiful walls, and to carry its treasures away to Susa where they thought to build a finer city than Babylon; but they proved themselves to be only spoilers; for while they dismantled Babylon, they never succeeded in making a city to be compared with it."

"What is the next characteristic mentioned?"

"It raised itself up on one side," read Charlie.

"I think, perhaps, you can explain that yourself," said Mrs. Ross.

"Was it because the Persians grew to have more power in the kingdom than the Medes who first held the throne?"

"Yes; that explains the rising up on one side. This point is brought out still more fully in the eighth chapter, where the kingdom is represented under the symbol of a ram with two horns, the higher of which came up last. An angel was to explain the symbol to Daniel. You may read the 20th verse, and see what this ram represented."

"The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia," read Charlie.

"No mistake can be made in interpreting these beasts when we let the Lord interpret them. History fills out the specifications of God's Word. What is the next thing about this beast?"

"And he had three ribs in the mouth of it, between the teeth of it. Now what does that mean, mama?"

"Think, Charlie, and see if you yourself cannot tell me. It was something in its power, under its absolute control."

"Very likely it was some country or people who were conquered and oppressed, as it is countries and peoples that governments control."

"You are right. But you notice that three ribs are in this beast's mouth. History tells us that three provinces were especially oppressed by the Medo-Persian power, because they especially opposed its advance. These provinces were Babylon, Lydia, and Egypt.

"After the ribs are between the teeth of this power, what are they represented as saying?"

"And they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh."

"When these provinces were convinced that it was no use to struggle against their conquerors, they willingly gave their strength to their former enemies, and by their warlike attitude to unconquered dominions, said, 'Go on and we will help you to subdue the world.' The history of these times abounds in incidents that illustrate the cruel character of the government."

"Yes, mama, I know that this kingdom was cruel; but as far as I have seen, all kingdoms have manifested the same characteristic. Did this kingdom ever seek to persecute men for their faith in God, and for doing his will?"

"Yes. Do you remember the story of Esther?"

"O yes, mama. I have always thought that was as interesting as a fairy story."

"You remember that the Jews had been taken to Babylon in the time of Nebuchadnezzar. During the lifetime of Cyrus, who was one of the most noble of earthly sovereigns, the Jews were permitted to return to Palestine if they wished to do so. It seems that many chose to remain in the Medo-Persian kingdom, and among them was Esther and her uncle and Daniel. At a later date many of these Jews returned to Jerusalem and rebuilt their city and temple just as the Lord had foretold that they would. Now can you tell me what officer in the government of Persia was filled with hatred for the Jews, and what he desired the king to do against them?"

"The officer was one next to the king whose name was Haman. He complained to the king that the Jews observed laws that were contrary to the kingdom, and that they ought to be killed. His hatred was aroused by Mordecai, Esther's uncle, because he would not bow down to him. Why was it, mama, that Mordecai would not bow to Haman?"

"It may have been for the same reason that the Quakers would not remove their hats in the presence of royalty. It involved a religious principle in their minds and gave an homage to man that they believed belonged alone to God. It was a very terrible thing for so great an officer to do for so trivial an offense. Because he was 'one bow short,' as some one says, he therefore must put to death a nation."

"O, but he didn't do it, mama. Esther risked her life to save her people, and the very gallows he had built to hang Mordecai on, was used to hang him on. The king then made void the decree he had sent over the realm, and instead of having a day of death, the Jews had a day of rejoicing."

"So far we have seen God interfering in behalf of his people when they were in trouble and persecution. You remember Mordecai said to Esther that if she would not intercede for the people, that deliverance would arise from another place. There is another incident that more fully brings out the malignity that may be brought upon the just and righteous through the unjust, unrighteous laws of ignorant or mistaken monarchs. There was one of the best statesmen in this kingdom who was very highly esteemed by the king, and was made one of the presidents of the rulers of the kingdom. Do you know who it was?"

"Daniel," said Charlie.

"Do you remember the jealousy of the rulers, and how they plotted his destruction?"

"O yes, mama. They said, We shall find no occasion against this Daniel, save concerning the law of his God."

"With murder in their hearts, they went in and flattered the king. Pretending to be a great friend of his, they persuaded him to sign a decree that no one should ask a petition of either God or man for thirty days, save of the king. They knew that Daniel would not obey such an unjust, blasphemous law, and waited to see him break the law, so that they might cast him into the den of lions. Daniel was careful for nothing. He knew that his God was the living God, and he would not place a man in God's stead. If all the world should ignore God's love, cease to acknowledge their dependence, defy his commands, he would be true. It was a time for God to work because men had made void his law. Daniel entered his chamber and prayed with his window open toward Jerusalem. He went about his duties as faithfully as ever. He would render unto Caesar the things that were Caesar's, and unto God the things that were God's. What a grand example the Christian has in Daniel!"

"But, mama, the king felt dreadfully when he saw through the schemes of these wicked men. He mourned all night that he could not save Daniel, and I believe he prayed that Daniel's God would deliver him. God did close the lions' mouths, and the next day Daniel was brought up out of the den, and the wicked men were thrown to the hungry lions, and no one sought to save them."

"How glad the king must have been to find out that Daniel's God was the God of deliverance. I think he must have been very much ashamed of his weakness in yielding to the flattery of these schemers. He could see that his legislation that struck at one of God's commandments worked disaster to his very best statesman and most loyal citizen. And it is always so. No king or government has ever legislated in such a way as to deprive men of their right to worship God according to the dictates of their consciences but that it has resulted in disaster to their best citizens."

"After Daniel's rescue Darius made a mistake in making a decree, ordering all his people to fear and tremble before the God of Daniel. That is, it was a mistake if it took the form of law. If it was simply a proclamation of his faith, it was all right; for we are bidden to be witnesses to the ends of the earth. But Christ's religion has nothing to do with compulsion. His worship must be in spirit and in truth."

"But, mama, I can see just why it was that the king made the decree. He was in the habit of legislating on matters of religion, and probably didn't know any better."

"And yet, Charlie, ignorance does not become a king, nor save his subjects from the consequences of bad legislation. We'll talk of this another time."
