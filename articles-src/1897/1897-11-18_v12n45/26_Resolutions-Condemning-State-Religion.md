At a meeting of the Secular League of Washington, D. C., held in that city November 7, the following resolutions were adopted, which, as a whole, are worthy of approving note:

"Resolved—That the Secular League of Washington has for its chief purposes the promotion of right living and high thinking, the protection of the rights of conscience and the maintenance of a total separation between religion and the government.

"That we welcome to our weekly meetings all persons of all creeds whatsoever, and that we invite to membership, without regard to sectarian affiliations, all persons who believe in the absolute separation of church and state.

"That we sympathize with the Methodists in their present efforts to prevent the establishment of a church State in Utah—a measure which would result in religious persecution.

"That we assure the newsboys of Washington of our cordial sympathy in their struggle for the maintenance of their rights; that we extend our sincere condolence to the Adventists, Seventh-day Baptists, Hebrews, and others, who, in many States of this union, are subjected to fines and imprisonment, and otherwise persecuted, under penal laws, for not upholding the first day of the week as essentially and intrinsically holier and more sacred than other days, and we denounce such laws as blots on American civilization.

"That we pledge ourselves to the support of an amendment to the National Constitution prohibiting the States from presenting or requiring religious tests for office; from creating State churches; from supporting religious institutions by direct tax or by exempting church property, and from appropriating money for sectarian schools or charities."
