RECENTLY Mr. Peacock, Minister of Education for Victoria, has had introduced into the state schools of the colony a "School Paper," in which appear religious lessons on various subjects, the scripture quotations in which are taken from the Protestant version of the Bible. Being under the impression that these "papers" were intended only for home reading, Archbishop Carr, of this city, made no objection; but upon learning that they were used in the schools, he at once sent in a protest to Mr. Peacock. In this he says:—

"It has been stated that no protest against such use has come from any source. For my part I should have at once protested had I known that the 'School Paper,' with its scripture lessons, was explained or interpreted for Catholic children by non-Catholic teachers."—Melbourne Age, September 13.

Of course Archbishop Carr and all Catholics have a perfect right thus to protest. No one has a right to use the state to teach any one any kind of religion.

But it is interesting to note how quickly even our Roman Catholic friends, when in the minority, become protesters, and protest against others, though in the majority and in power, using the power and institutions of the state to enforce upon them or their children anything in religion of which they do not approve. In this they acknowledge that the Protestant principle is right. By this single protest Archbishop Carr (and all who join him in it) yields to the principle laid down by the Protestant princes at the Diet of Spires, in 1529, that "in matters of conscience the majority has no power." It would have been well if both Catholics and Protestants had always acted upon this principle when they were in the majority. It is strange that men can see the justness of the principle only when they are in the minority.

### THE PRINCIPLE APPLIED.

Roman Catholics protest against Protestants teaching religion in the state schools as Protestants understand and believe it, when Protestants are in the majority. This they have a perfect right to do. But if they believe that their protest in this respect should be heard (and it should), then they must admit that the majority have no right to use the state to force upon the minority their religion and religious opinions, at least when the majority are Protestants. But if Protestants have no right to use the state to teach their religious ideas and opinions when they are in the majority, neither have Catholics when they are in the majority. And if neither Protestants nor Catholics have the right, no one has, and this means that church and state should be totally separate, which is our position precisely. Any legal connection between the two is wrong in principle and injurious to both.
