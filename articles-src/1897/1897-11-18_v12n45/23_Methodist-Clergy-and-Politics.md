Methodist clergymen of Bangor, Me., have begun a movement for improving the morals of the people in that city. In pursuance of this object a union service will be held in the City Hall on Thanksgiving Day, at which four of the clergy will deliver addresses on lawlessness, its effect, the responsibility, and the remedy. It is expected that the movement will lead to a more active participation by the clergy in local politics, in connection with the "State Civic League," which has branches in the leading cities.

But where were morals ever known to be elevated by means of politics?
