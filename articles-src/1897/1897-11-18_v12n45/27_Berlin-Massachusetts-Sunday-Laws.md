At a mass meeting, held last month in Berlin, Mass., to promote the cause of compulsory Sunday observance in that State, it was resolved that,

"Forasmuch as Sunday work is opposed to the laws of God and this commonwealth, as well as injurious to the health and morals of the workingmen, we, the citizens of Berlin, assembled in the Clement Opera House on Oct. 20, 1897, do hereby protest against the same as practiced in certain mills in this city.

"We respectfully request the owners and superintendents of said mills to discontinue unnecessary work in their mills.

"In case of refusal to do so, we ask the city officials to see that the Sunday laws of this commonwealth are enforced.

"We appoint the clergy of the city to act as a committee to carry out the suggestions of these resolutions, to issue calls for future public meetings, and to organize a local Sunday protective league if it seems advisable."

The only trouble with this resolution is that it makes a wrong start. The assumption that Sunday work is opposed to the laws of God, is wide of the truth, and hence is altogether devoid of force. And even if it were true, it would furnish no warrant for compulsory interference with any person's practice in that respect. Any sin is contrary to the law of God, but it is vain to prohibit sin by human enactments.

But if there were any force in the alleged fact, as a proper basis for Sunday legislation, it would be altogether superfluous to add that Sunday work is opposed to the laws of the commonwealth. The laws of the commonwealth can add nothing to the sinfulness of a practice which is contrary to the law of God.

And as regards the health and morals of the workingmen, there is nothing to show that Sunday work injures them more than does Monday work, or work on any other day. If it be injurious to health to work seven days in the week, this is no reason for putting the blame of it all upon the work done on Sunday. From a health standpoint, a rest on any one day of the week is just as valuable as a rest on any other day.

Nor is there any proof that Sunday work is necessarily injurious to morals. A man's practice is determined by the state of his morals and not the state of his morals by his practice. "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh." And any person who does not believe in Sunday as a day of obligatory rest, cannot become one whit less moral by regularly working upon that day.
