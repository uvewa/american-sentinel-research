But I hear a great cry over "godless education." It is a pretty phrase enough. And men are often guided and governed by phrases. I knew a man once who invented a liniment. He called it, let us say, "Socrates' Grecian Pain-Killer," and nobody would buy a bottle. Comparatively a small number of his neighbors, you see, had ever heard of Socrates; and not one of them cared anything for the Greeks, at that time, because the enlightened press had not yet told them what magnificent disseminators of the gospel of truth and love those lamb-like creatures were. There came into contact with this man another, who invented not, but had analyzed and assayed his fellows. The two formed a partnership; the last mentioned at once changed the name of the liniment. He called it, let us say again, "St. Patrick's Salvation Ointment." He never even suggested any change in the formula. But, in a few years, those partners were wealthy.

Thus are men swayed by words. And when you talk about "godless education," you seem to many to make a great point for the Bible in the public schools. But, in fact, the phrase is utterly irrelevant. What is the trouble about a "godless education," so far as a school is concerned? The school is established to teach things of this world, not of the next. What has "godliness" to do with the Latin grammar? In what different way would a godly man explain the solution of a problem in quadratic equations, from the way in which an ungodly man would elucidate the same subject? What is the distinction between a godly and an ungodly map of the United States?
