It will, we think, be conceded by everyone that when any church or religious order believes that it is being treated unjustly or discriminated against in any way by the government under which it exists, it has a right, as a church, to protest and appeal from such action of the government. But that a church, as a church, should in its organized, authoritative capacity petition the government in regard to the relations of the government to other nations is quite another affair, and its right and propriety in doing so are very questionable. But the church known as The United Brethren in Christ has, in a late general conference held at Toledo, Ohio, passed the following resolution, which is addressed to President McKinley:—

"Based on our latest advice as to the situation, we, the members of the twenty-second general conference of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, representing 250,000 communicants, do hereby earnestly express the hope that, in behalf of liberty and humanity, you in your wisdom may see your way clear to declare in favor of the recognition of the belligerent rights of the Cuban people."

This is not the first time that a church has endeavored to influence the Government of the United States in a certain direction; but heretofore, as far as our knowledge extends, efforts of this character have been confined to an attempt to influence the Government's action in regard to some affair which concerned no other nation than our own. But here is a change. The United Brethren in Christ, as a church, are trying to influence the Government in regard to a measure of foreign policy, involving its relations with another nation. Not only so, but they are advising an action which many think would embroil this nation in a war with Spain! This is hardly consonant with the true idea of the nature and duty of the Church of Jesus Christ.

The fact is the churchmen of our day have gotten so far away from the true, scriptural idea of what the church exists for, that they are liable to thrust the church into almost anything. Had the first Christian council which assembled in Jerusalem in the year A.D. 51 passed a resolution calling upon the Emperor of Rome to grant belligerent rights to Radimister, who at that time was engaged in a war against Vonones II., King of Persia, it would have been no more incongruous and out of place than this late action of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ.

If this church, or any other church, has a mission or any excuse or reason for a denominational existence, it is for the purpose of saving souls. Neither it, nor any other church, has any mission to advise or suggest to the Government what its foreign policy shall be. If war is troubling any land, there is always a proper thing for Christians to do, and whether they call themselves "United Brethren" or not they can be "united" in this: To humbly petition the King of heaven, through Jesus Christ, that human passions and ambitions may be stayed, war restrained; that kings and rulers may so conduct the civil affairs entrusted to them "that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty" (1 Tim. 2:2), and that the peculiar and sole work of the church, to save souls, may not be restrained or hindered by war or other evil things. Such petitions may be presented every day, and we may be sure that they will not be made in vain.
