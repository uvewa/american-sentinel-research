But religion is an important part of education. True, but it is not all of education; nor is it a part with which any but a parochial school has anything to do. The origin of the parochial school is easy enough to trace. It originated in the selfishness and laziness of parents. The parent's bounden duty to inculcate in the mind of his growing child the truths of religion, the obligation and the joy of a religious life, is shifted on the shoulders of the clerical master of a parochial school. It is a convenient arrangement, and saves a world of trouble to a really conscientious parent. When such a pious person turns his eyes public school-ward, it seems hard to him that he cannot by its means relieve himself of as much responsibility as he can get rid of through the instrumentality of a parochial school, which costs him a good deal more money than the other. If the Bible is read to his boy at school, then he can spend the evening with the newspaper instead of pondering with the little fellow over the Sermon on the Mount, and be easy.
