In this, as in all other departments of the world of thought, there is plenty of conscious, as well as of unconscious cant. People play upon the word "instruction;" they even try to tamper with the sacred name of religion. They say they do not want religious instruction; all they want, forsooth, is prayers and Bible reading. But this is wicked trifling with truth and the essence of reality. Instruction is not necessarily given as such. It is given by example—by action. If a teacher were to read out every morning to his class three or four pages of "Tom" Paine's "Age of Reason," without comment, would not his scholars conclude, and rightly conclude, that he accepted the views of that author, and deemed it advisable for them to do the same? If he read it privately, and they detected him in so doing, would they not give to what they secretly perused in the volume all the weight of his personal authority and influence over them?

How does it affect the principle at stake, that either the Bible or the "Age of Reason" is read "without comment"? The Bible is a sacred book. It is partly made up, it is true, of mere historical narration. But it is not read by any but great scholars for its history. It is read and loved by those who choose to read and love it because of what they believe to be its divine inspiration. It is studied because of its assumed authority as an exponent of a religious system, or cult. Those who so treasure it do not desire that it should be read or studied for any other reason, or in any other light, in schools, or anywhere else. Its reading must necessarily be recognized by the scholars as a public proclamation of their teacher that he individually believes in its sacred character, and would have them do so—that he gathers his faith from its pages, and would have them do the same. None of the advocates of the Bible in the public schools would busy themselves in the least about the matter, if they did not build upon this very hope and expectation.
