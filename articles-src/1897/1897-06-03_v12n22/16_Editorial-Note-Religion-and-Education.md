It is perfectly true that religion is a part, and a very important part of a child's education. But it by no means follows that he should receive this particular part at a public school. The parochial school, it is well understood, in advance, discharges this parental function. It operates under the guidance and direction of a priest or preacher, selected by the parents, accepting their faith, professing and inculcating their creed. Those who send their young to such an institution do so with the desire and upon the condition that certain dogmas shall be taught, along with the sciences, the mathematics and the classics. The teaching is uniform, and acceptable to all alike. But the very moment that you invite the members of more than one sect or denomination to send their children to the same school, then uniformity of instruction in religious matters becomes impossible, without doing violence to the religious faith and sentiments of some one.
