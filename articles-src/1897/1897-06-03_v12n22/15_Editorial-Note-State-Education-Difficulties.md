But, like all other forms of activity, for good or for evil, the work of State education brings with it certain difficulties and perplexities of its own. Always the point is presented—how much of the father's primary duty in the way of education shall the State take upon itself? There is physical punishment, for instance. Conceding its advisability, under any circumstances, shall a public school teacher administer corporal chastisement in person, or merely advise the child's father to do so? There are scores of little matters of personal habit, cleanliness, politeness, etc., etc., which are important parts of a child's education, and respecting which the provinces of parent and teacher are not by any means sharply defined as to their boundaries. Where the relation is merely between two private citizens, how they agree on its establishment, how they modify its incidents, when or why they sever it, concerns no one but themselves. But make the teacher an officer of the State, and you at once convert every detail of his work with every pupil into a thing of public concern, in which the entire community is interested. The greatest embarrassment in this direction grows out of the divergence of religions among the people.
