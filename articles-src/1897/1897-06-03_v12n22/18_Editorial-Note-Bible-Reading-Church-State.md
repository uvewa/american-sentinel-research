The character of the Bible, as a sacred book, renders it impossible that it should be used in a school for any other purpose than to commend a certain form or type of religion to the scholars. This being the case, it is obvious that its use in a public school embodies that union of Church and State against which it is the main purpose of these humble paragraphs to protest most earnestly. Few people stop to think how many points of a purely religious nature are necessarily assumed and preached by the mere act of reading the Bible in a school, as it can only be read—in its sacred character. Is there a Deity? Has he made a special "revelation" to man? Have we here the only such revelation ever made, and do these pages contain it all? And so forth, and so on. Concerning all such topics, there be many minds among men. Differences minute and innumerable exist, and all the differences are about religion, and nothing else in the world. To decide any one of them for the young is to teach and preach religion. To decide any one of them by reading the Bible in the public schools is to effectuate pro tanto a union of Church and State.
