A PROMINENT actor preached in a Western pulpit some days ago, and took occasion to say that if there were no vicious audiences there would be no vicious plays. This is true enough, but it hardly constitutes an excuse for those who produce vicious plays. That men have vices is no justification for those who make a living by pandering to them. While there are many clean and beautiful plays, and many honest, upright men and women, no doubt, upon the stage, it is a fact, unless the philosophers of all the ages are wrong, that the moral atmosphere of the play house is distinctly worse than that of the community at large. Perhaps nobody is to blame for this in particular; it may be that, humanly speaking, it is the unpreventable result of the environment.

The actor has no home, and no home life for the greater part of the year. He is a wanderer among men. He has no social environment to brace him up on every side. He is forced to keep bad hours, and to live with more or less irregularity. Moreover, there is probably something that tends, at any rate, to weaken the ties of self-respect in his business. To be always "personating"—to live in an artificial world, night after night—to seek applause by the very skill with which you bury yourself from sight, and feign emotions which you do not feel—to cater constantly to the many headed, the thoughtless, the butterflies of society—these things may be considered as drawbacks to the higher life and the ideal moral state of mind.
