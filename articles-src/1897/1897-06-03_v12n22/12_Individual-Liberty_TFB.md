*Extracts from speech delivered before the Edinburgh Philosophical Institute, Nov. 7, 1895. Published in the New York World, Dec. 13, 1895.*

**NEVER** since the world was peopled has mankind stood in such anxious expectancy, awaiting the outcome of the immediate future, as in these closing years of the nineteenth century. Men are wistfully striving to peer through the portals of the year 1900—marvelling as the effect and forces of applied science are unfolded to our comprehension, and discovery moves on, each invention leading in another, in stately procession; we, all the while, wrapped in wonder, are straining in hope and fear to catch the coming word, and to comprehend its import.

Never was speculation so rife, never was the field of human observation so unobstructed and expanded, nor the ascertainment and sifting of facts so facile. Never were opinions more diverse, nor was it ever so obviously important to detect and assert the philosophical principle, in recognition and obedience to which, the *lucidus* *ordo* of human government may be preserved and kept in view, and the retrocession of mankind prevented.

At no stage of history was it more important to call to mind the great principle that government is a means, not an end, and is instituted to maintain those general liberties which are essential for human happiness and progress.

## GREAT MOVEMENT OF UNREST.

There is a deep movement of unrest in the breasts of men, and the forces of society move in strong and variant currents—the concentrated weight of armed repression and the upheavals of popular discontent are alike plainly discernable.

In some countries consolidation of empire progresses remarkably and impressively—in others disintegration is equally signified. Old dynasties, in sorrowful impotency, are drifting helplessly on the surface of events, or sinking palpably and hopelessly into the sea of time, which threatens soon to ingulf them, and even the memories of their unproductive civilization—the roots of which have dried up and lost the principle of growth.

Other nations appear glowing, sanguine, self-confidence, in lusty vigor and verility, springing forward and upward as though vivified by an elixir vitae, which expels fear and feebleness, and sends strength and hope tingling through every fibre.

In some nations the hand of autocratic power and unequal privilege appears to tighten upon society, and if now and then it seems to relax its hold, it is only to extend and fasten more securely its grip upon the masses over whom it bears sway.

In others, the progress of the doctrine and spirit of democracy widens the base of power, and calls into political consolidation the great body of the inhabitants, depositing the ultimate power of decision in a majority of the members.

Never were the destructive forces of warfare marshalled in such impressive array as we see them to-day—never before did earth shake under the measured tread of so many men armed and prepared to be armed—never in history were weapons so lethal, missiles so mighty, and explosives so terrific and powerful, or in hands so carefully drilled and instructed in their employment—never were the preparations for war on land and sea comparable in scale and efficiency, to those of the present day.

Contemplating all these terrific forces, there is no thoughtful man who is not anxiously questioning his heart, What does all this preparation portend? What is to be the result to the civilization and progress of the human race of the conflict of such forces, and the changes it may at any moment create?

## WEIGHT OF TAXATION GROWING.

But this disposition to an exaggerated and ever-increasing militarism is necessarily accompanied by grievous pecuniary burdens; the weight of taxation is growing fearfully, and as men are withdrawn from productive industries and remunerative pursuits, the great engine of the State, the sovereign power of taxation, is put in motion everywhere and in every shape to gather revenues to support the vast expenditures.

The forces of productive industry were never so great, and the burdens upon their products were never so heavy. Combination and consolidation to resist injustice and competition for success have gradually arrayed capital and labor in opposite camps, in which the power of each is separately and too often aversely organized, and serious conflicts have occured, and conflicts more serious are impending, which threaten disaster to that tranquility and good order of the State, which are essential not only for its progress, but for the maintenance of the civilization to which the world has attained.

In this threatened conflict and confusion of the forces of society, and seeking the origin of that free government which is essential for happiness and progress, and how it shall be perpetuated, I ask, What is its germ? What is the seed from which human liberty springs? and which must never be overlooked, but renewed, and replanted and protected as the generations of men pass away and their successors fill their places?

When I contemplate the autocratic power which is exercised in some countries to-day, and behold the organized and associated powers of wealth and numbers welded in such an overwhelming phalanx in others, I ask, Where is the safety and personal freedom of the individual? How is it to be guarded and secured? For the freedom of its individual members is the essential basis of the freedom of the State. The movement of the day, sometimes open, sometimes concealed in the robes of philanthropy and paternalism, but more often discernable in policies purely selfish, is toward State Socialism, as an opposing force to Autocracy. But either is Despotism, and fatal to that individual freedom of man's mind and soul which is the instrumentality by which the world, under the very laws of its origin and progress, has been raised from brutality and barbarism to its present standard of civilization.

These problems of society rise on every side, and the peace and order of the world are seriously menaced.

### WHAT BECOMES OF THE INDIVIDUAL.

The centripetal forces seem to move almost irresistibly towards consolidation and centralization, and in the presence of such exaggerated militarism, with its stupendous powers, with the vast plutocratic combinations of incorporated wealth and capital so closely in alliance; with the widespread national and international popular organizations of labor, with their solidified, massed, numerical force, one asks, with just alarm, What is to become of the individual—the freeman, the essential unit of a society that hopes to retain the principle of growth and progress; of adaptation to those advances and improvements which demand the open mind, the complete liberty of human faculties, first for their discovery, and after that for their reception and assimilation? Is there not cause to fear lest between the upper and the nether millstones of the twin despotisms, military absolutism and socialistic tyranny, the freedom of the individual may be ground to death?
