UNQUESTIONABLY, the undertaking of the work of education by the State involves the surrender of the great doctrine that the function of civil government is police and police alone. Education is a paternal duty; the State that undertakes it in so far assumes the position of a natural parent—it adopts paternalism into its system of administration. Whether this be a good thing to do or not, the public school is so firmly rooted in the affections of the American people that any attempt to dislodge it would be vain, and no shorter cut to unpopularity can easily be found than any serious criticism or questions on the subject. The tendency is rather to enlarge than to curtail the activities of the body politic in this direction, and no matter how heavy the taxes thus become, they are always cheerfully borne.
