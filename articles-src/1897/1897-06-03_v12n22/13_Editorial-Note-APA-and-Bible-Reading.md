I NOTE that the "A. P. A." is taking an active part in supporting certain public school managers who countenance the reading of the Bible in the establishments under their charge, in spite of the protests of many parents. This matter has frequently led to bitter disputes, and the fate of parties and of statesmen has sometimes hung on its settlement. In Canada the public school and its relations to religion have been discussed with an intensity of feeling fortunately—so far—undeveloped among our people. Nevertheless, every now and then, some very harsh language is indulged in by our disputants, and compromises are, as usual, perfectly satisfactory to nobody. The thing is deplorable; but it is, to some extent inevitable, from the very nature and existence of the public schools.
