Cheswold, Del., May 21st, 1897.

**EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL:**

Brethren Leslie Munce and Robert Williams will spend Sabbath, May 22, behind the cold bars of a prison cell, because they choose to serve God rather than man.

The particulars of the case are as follows:

Mr. J. Thompson, justice of peace at Cheswold, Del., called Brother Leslie Munce at the hour for trial and said: "Leslie Munce, you are charged with doing work on the 25th day of April, 1897, the sabbath day. What have you got to say?"

Bro. Munce: "Not guilty."

"Robert Williams, you are charged with a like offense, what do you say?"

Robt. Williams: "Not guilty."

Mr. John Carney was the first witness for the prosecution.

Justice, to Mr. Carney: "Now, John, tell us what you know about this case. Did you see Leslie Munce doing work on the 25th day of April last, the sabbath day?"

Carney: "Yes, sir; on the 25th day of last April I saw Leslie Munce go along the road with a grubbing hoe on his shoulder going toward the church, and he went to the church and stayed a while and came back and went over in the field and went to digging up sprouts; and this man, Robert Williams, picked them up and carried them to the woods and threw them in the woods. And that, sir, is what I saw him do."

Justice, to Maud Carter (second witness): "Tell us what you know about this case of Leslie Munce and Robert Williams. Did you see them doing work on the sabbath day?"

Maud Carter: "Yes, sir, I did see Leslie Munce digging up bushes. I was out to Uncle Will Morgan's and I saw Leslie Munce grubbing up bushes and Robert Williams picking them up and throwing them in the woods. That, sir, is all."

Justice: "Now, Leslie Munce, what do you say?"

Leslie Munce: "Squire, will you allow me to ask the witnesses a few questions?"

Justice: "Yes; I forgot that."

Leslie Munce: "Mr. John Carney, you are the first witness. You say you saw me digging up bushes on the sabbath day."

Witness: "Yes; I did."

Munce: "John, can you tell me which day is the Sabbath day?"

Witness (confused): "Well, I did; we take Sunday; it was on the 25th of April."

Justice: "That won't do; it is contempt of court. We take the first day for the Sabbath, and it is indorsed by the laws of this State and the United States and the civilized world over, as the Sabbath. So your argument won't do."

Munce: "Squire, you say that Sunday is the first day of the week."

Justice: "Yes."

Munce: "The Bible says the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God."

Justice: "Stop; we don't want the Bible; that won't do; and if you don't stop I will fine you for contempt of court. The Bible is not what we want, it is the law."

Munce: "Well, Squire, can't you allow the evidence of the Bible in this matter?"

Justice: "No; the Bible is not the thing; it is the law we want."

Munce: "Is not that a Bible you swore the witnesses on?"

Justice: "Yes."

Munce: "How is it, Squire, you will not take the testimony of these witnesses unless they swear by God's Word that what they say is truth? If they can be allowed these oaths by God's word, why not accept my statements concerning the Sabbath by God's word?"

Justice: "That will do; I don't want any more. You have got to stop."

Munce: "All right, Squire; I will ask the other witness a question. Maud, why did you seek to do me a wrong?"

Maud Carter: "I wanted to show you what the law could do with you."

Justice (to second witness): "That will do, now; I want you to stop where you are and don't say any more."

Justice to Leslie Munce: "I fine you $4 and costs, amounting to $2.19, making $6.19. And Robert Williams, you are fined with the same amount, making $12.38 in all."

Constable to Munce: "Leslie Munce, what are you going to do?"

Munce: "It is for you and the Squire to say what you are going to do."

Justice: "Are you going to pay the fine?"

Munce: "No; I have done no one any harm, and I cannot pay anything."

So the constable went and got his horse and wagon, and Brothers Munce and Williams got in on the rear seat with the constable in front, and the people seemed to think they were two as harmless criminals as could have been seen.

So Brothers Munce and Williams spent their Sabbath in Dover Jail. But Brother Munce said he never spent a better Sabbath in his life. The Lord was with him, and he never realized the need of the Saviour as at that time, and everything went as pleasant as could be. The hardened criminals seemed to drink in the Word of God like water as they had never had the Bible read to them in that light. Brother Munce had opportunity to give away some tracts and to talk some in favor of the truth. He was in jail only twenty-four hours. Those hardened criminals made him promise them he would come again and bring them some reading matter and read to them. We can accomplish wonders if we will only be led by the Spirit of God.

So we want to say, as the great Teacher said, "We come to do Thy will, O God, for Thy law is within our hearts." And the prospect is that if we continue to keep this law of God there will be more of us to go to jail soon.

The spirit of persecution seems to be stalking at large at present. Those who hate us are taking pains to spy out our liberty, and some of the lower class say they will give in all they see at work on Sunday, both men and women.
