THE Christian Endeavorer says:—

"It is estimated that there are to-day over 3,000,000 laboring men in the United States who are compelled to labor every Sabbath [Sunday], or at least to labor on the Sabbath the same as upon other days."

Whoever made this estimate made a miscalculation. There is not a man in the United States who is compelled to work on the Sabbath; no, not in all the world. To work on the Sabbath the same as on other days is a sin, and no man in all the world is compelled to sin. If he were, then sin would not be sin. There is no law in the United States requiring any man to work on Sunday, the sabbath the *Christian Endeavorer* refers to, and even though there were, no one would absolutely have to work on that day. All could refuse.

"But," says one, "they would lose their jobs, and that means starvation." But what if they did lose their jobs, could not God in His infinite providence provide others? Would He see men starve in refusing to do wrong and daring to do right? Has He not promised never to forsake the righteous? Does He suffer their seed to beg bread? Does He not know their needs, and does He not care for them? Is not their bread and water sure? Where is men's faith in God? In what or in whom are men trusting when they talk of being compelled to do wrong in order to make a living? How can professed Christians expect others to do otherwise than wrong, when they do not possess sufficient stamina to do what they believe to be right? And how much value are they setting upon truth, when they show themselves unwilling to make any sacrifice in order to live it?

Saturday is by far a busier business day in the United States than Sunday. More jobs a hundred times are to be lost by refusing to work on that day than on Sunday, and yet no one hears of observers of the seventh day being compelled to work on the Sabbath. They are not compelled to do anything of the kind. They do not work on the Sabbath, and they live too. They have the courage to live up to their convictions, and trust God for the consequences. What is a man's moral worth who will not do this? Instead of yielding and catering and cringing to the world and worldly customs, and looking to the world for life and sustenance, let men be taught "that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live." Let them be taught the faith, the manly independence, and the Christian courage expressed in the following stanza:

> "Dare to be right! dare to be true!
> Foes may be many, and friends may be few.
> Truth and her champions oft stand alone,
> What's a man good for without a backbone?"

If the present blessing in keeping the Sabbath and the final reward for obedience are not sufficient to compensate for whatever sacrifice or inconvenience they may entail in this life, then the Sabbath is not worth keeping at all. But we hold a very different view.
