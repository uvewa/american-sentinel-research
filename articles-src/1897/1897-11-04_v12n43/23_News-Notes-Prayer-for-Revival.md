At a recent meeting of pastors representing all leading denominations in "Greater New York," resolutions were passed setting apart November 10 as "a day of prayer and exposition of Scripture concerning prayer," and calling upon pastors and churches in all the States to assemble at some hour on that day "for the purpose of praying God to revive his people."

This is right; it is what the times demand. God has power to revive his people, and he would have his people pray for a revival. He would have them pray to him instead of to Congress and State legislatures. He would have them seek for that righteousness which exalteth a nation, through him, rather than through politics.
