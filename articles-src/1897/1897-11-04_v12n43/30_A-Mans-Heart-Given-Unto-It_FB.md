"Well, where did we leave off, Charlie?"

"In our last talk, mama, we had come to the place where the three Hebrews were delivered out of the furnace, because God wanted to show Nebuchadnezzar that he had no business to interfere with men's religious rights."

"What symbols had we explained?"

"The lion and the eagle's wings."

"Yes, I remember now what I was going to say to you about the deliverance. David says, 'Thou hast delivered me out of the mouth of the lion.' In another place in the Bible, it says that Satan is going about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. You can easily see, then, who it is that influences men to turn the powers ordained of God for the protection of men in their rights, into that beast-like power that denies and then defrauds men of their rights. Behind this lion-like kingdom was the spirit of the lion who has ever shown a beast-like enmity against those who would keep the commandments of God."

"I see," said Charlie; "now the next thing is that the lion was lifted up like a man, and a man's heart was given unto it."

"Before we go into that part of the prophecy, let us see what God had foretold in regard to this kingdom. Turn to Isaiah 13 and read from the 17th verse."

Charlie read: "'Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it. . . . And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldee's excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. It shall never be inhabited; . . . and the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses.'"

"You see it was to be entirely overthrown, to be the haunt of wild beasts, and never to be rebuilt."

"What, that great and beautiful city?"

"Yes; its destruction was foretold nearly two hundred years before it was taken by the Medes and Persians. Moreover, the very name of the general who was to take it, was written by the hand of the prophet long before his birth."

"O mama, tell me quick where I can find that; for I have been reading about that general. Just to think of his name being in the Bible before he was born."

"Forty-fifth of Isaiah, begin at the first verse."

Charlie read: "'Thus saith the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two-leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut.'"

"Why, mama, it is really wonderful the way God has foretold everything, and yet God is God, of course, and knows the end from the beginning. It was just that way, mama."

"Now, knowing these prophecies as to its overthrow, let us study some of the causes that made such a result unavoidable. Babylon was represented as a lion with eagle's wings in the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, and the history of its conquests that brought many nations into captivity shows that the symbol is fitting. But in Belshazzar's reign (and his name means Bel's or Baal's prince), the kingdom underwent a change that might well be represented by the man and the man's heart. You notice first that the wings were plucked. Its power of conquest was gone. Rich and increased with goods, Belshazzar gave himself up to luxury, feasting, and pleasure-seeking. The god he worshiped demanded all this, for it was Baal; and Baal, after all, is only a god made like corruptible man. This god was self, as we have before explained, so the king and his lords of whom he had ten thousand, with their wives and concubines, reveled in pleasure. You know any individual that takes this course becomes weak, and so with a state; and so Babylon that had been the fear and majesty of kingdoms, now shows only the weakness and heart of a man. And now, Charlie, what have you found out in regard to its overthrow?"

"Why, mama, war began in the last year of Nebuchadnezzar's life, and continued till the overthrow in 338. The Medes began the war, then they called to their aid the Persians, under Cyrus. He was a wonderful man, and a great general. The Babylonians were driven from one stronghold to another, till finally they were shut up in the great city. Belshazzar and his people felt secure within their great walls and gates. They laughed and mocked at Cyrus as he dug trenches about the city. I believe it says he encamped a whole year without any show of success. The people in the city had food laid up for twenty years, and plenty of ground to cultivate, and they became very careless and reckless. Some one says that Belshazzar called the great feast we read about in the fifth of Daniel, to praise his gods because Isaiah's prophecy had not been fulfilled. You know that while they were feasting, the fingers of a man's hand wrote that he was found wanting, and that his kingdom was given to the Medes and Persians."

"While all this was going on, Cyrus had turned the Euphrates from its course into a lake; and as the water ran down, his armies marched under the walls up the bed of the river, and there they found the river gates open, just as the prophet had said. I suppose while the hand was writing, the soldiers were marching up the streets unhindered, and the trembling king and his lords became an easy prey; for it says in that night was Belshazzar slain, and Darius the Mede took the kingdom."

"You have told it very well, Charlie. The fulfilment of the prophecy in regard to its utter destruction, runs through some hundreds of years, but we know to-day that it is an utter ruin. Men have unearthed the ruins, and have in this century found some valuable tablets confirming the Bible history of Belshazzar's feast. Babylon reaped its own sowing. It failed to protect men in the exercise of their rights, failed to protect itself against the forces of evil within itself, and so was its own destroyer. Like Pharaoh, Belshazzar had asked, 'Who is the Lord that I should obey his voice?' Doubtless as has been suggested, he knew of the prophecy, and yet defied God. It is certain that he had had the light of Daniel's Consistent life; for he knew he was a servant of God when he called for him to read the writing on the wall. His course reminds me of a text that we see illustrated all around us. 'Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the hearts of the sons of men are fully set in them to do evil.'"

"The student of history has one of the best fields in which to study the law of cause and effect; and indeed, no nation would be in peril if its people would study the past, and take heed to its lessons."

"You will notice, Charlie, that no nation is destroyed till the cup of its iniquity is full, or the causes for its overthrow fully ripe. It is the same in individual life, Charlie. And that is why I want you to cut off every evil habit in its beginning. Be careful not to indulge the natural wish to domineer, to boss, to bring others to your way of thinking. It is selfish indulgence, the lack of self-control that leads to the destruction of the life powers, and to the final loss of the soul. All this I know you in yourself are powerless to do, but you know there is the God of the Hebrews to whom you can appeal."

"O mama, I am so glad we began these studies. I feel more than ever that I want to grow up loyal to God and truth and to the principles of true liberty. I wish I could meet such men as were Daniel and the Hebrew children. I hope that I shall meet them in the new Jerusalem."

"O Charlie, what a happy city that will be! We shall see God's plan of government fully brought out. His government is based on love. To understand the principles that will rule in that city, and to be in harmony with them, will fit us to be its inhabitants. Do not forget to study the life of Christ, to seek for his grace day by day, that we may be heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ."

"Now I must leave you to study the second beast, and to prepare for our next talk."

"All right, mama, I am so much obliged for your help. I never thought before there was so much to these beasts with wings and horns."
