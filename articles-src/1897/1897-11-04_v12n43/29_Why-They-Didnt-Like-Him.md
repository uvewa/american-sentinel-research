"WELL, my little boy, did you have a nice time this afternoon?"

"No, mother," answered Mrs. Price's little boy, "not very."

"Why not," she asked in surprise.

"Why, mother, the boys won't play with me; they don't treat me right."

"Do you treat them right, Harry?"

"I—I don't treat them at all," he said, hesitatingly.

The mother didn't say any more about the matter then, but she felt troubled at Harry's account of his place among his playmates. The next time he took his ball and went to the park, she put on her bonnet and followed.

There were a good many people in the park, and Mrs. Price stood back. Presently she saw her little boy go off alone.

"Who is that little boy?" she asked some children near her.

"That? Oh, that is Harry Price," they answered, but they had no idea they were talking to his mother.

"Why doesn't he play with the rest of you, instead of going off by himself?" asked the lady.

"Oh, I don't know; he doesn't play nice, somehow."

"What's the matter?"

"Why, he always wants to have his own way."

"Don't you all want to have your own way?"

"Yes'm," answered the little girl, buttoning up her coat and getting ready to start off; "yes'm, but you see we all give up sometimes; one day I give up to Susie, and the next day Susie gives up to me, and so we get along; but Harry never wants to give up at all—never; and that won't do."

"No," said Harry's mother, "I see that wouldn't do at all."

That evening Mrs. Price told her little boy about her visit to the park.

"I wanted to let you look at yourself with their eyes, Harry," she said; "and now that you know what is the matter with Harry Price, and why the boys and girls don't like him, I am sure you can mend matters."

Harry looked very solemn and downcast, and the mother said gently:

"When my little boy remembers that that must have been the way it looked to the heavenly Father, too, I am sure he will try to do differently."

And he did, with successful and happy results.—Great Thoughts.
