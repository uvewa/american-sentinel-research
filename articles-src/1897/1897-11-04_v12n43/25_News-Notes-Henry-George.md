BEFORE this paper reaches our readers one of the most exciting political contests in the history of the country will have been settled—the election of mayor of Greater New York—with the details of which all who read the newspapers are more or less familiar. We have no disposition to enter into the merits of the political situation. The SENTINEL does not deal with the questions it discusses from that standpoint, but as a matter of fact, we may say that no one who is not on the ground and actually sees for himself can appreciate the situation. No stone is left unturned to accomplish what is desired. Four candidates are in the field—two Republican and two Democratic—two for what is called "Boss Rule," and two who pose as the champions of the rights of the people. The two latter candidates are Hon. Seth Low, President of Columbian College, and Hon. Henry George, so well known throughout the country. Right in the very heat of the controversy Mr. George was stricken with apoplexy, and died. Whatever may be said of Mr. George's political opinions, all unite in attributing to him sincerity of motive and a genuine friendship for the people. The demonstration at his funeral on Sunday last was one of the largest ever known in the city. The following he had among the laboring classes seemed wonderful, and spoke in tones louder than any words the deep-seated feeling of unrest and dissatisfaction that is felt over the unequal distribution of wealth. They looked to Mr. George as a leader to right many of the wrongs that exist. In a speech just before he died, he said, "If I am elected mayor of Greater New York, I will endeavor to the very best of my ability to give to every man his right—whether he be a hod carrier or a millionaire." This is the true principle on which government should be conducted—equal rights to all and privileges to none. We are far from that now.
