ARCHBISHOP CARR and the bishops of the Roman Catholic Province of Melbourne, including Bendigo, Ballarat, and Sale, in a meeting held September 3, set forth the Catholic position on the school question. They say that although the present Education Act of Victoria was passed to give "free, secular, and compulsory education to the children of the colony,"—

"Catholics protested from the beginning against the principle of divorcing religious from secular instruction in the schools."

But of the National Scripture Education League's proposition to introduce religious instruction in the state schools, these bishops further say:—

"Such unauthorized doctrinal teaching is radically opposed to the fundamental principle of authority on which Catholic faith is based," and that "the only safeguard for Catholic children under such circumstances would be a conscience clause totally forbidding their presence while such doctrinal instruction was being given."

—Melbourne Age, Sept. 4, 1897.

Putting these two statements together, we have this plainly deducible conclusion: The prelates of the Roman Catholic Church are not, on principle, opposed to the union of religion and the state; on the contrary, they are in favor of such union, provided the religion thus united to, and enforced by, the state is that which is "authorized" by the Roman Catholic Church. And such in truth, is the fact.

"A PRINCIPLE which commands our reason is no less sacred and imperative than a statute."
