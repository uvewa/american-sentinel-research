FAILING to secure by argument and persuasion what they deem necessary to the future well-being of the country, the clerical advocates of Sunday rest now declare that they will "demand" what they want. A Methodist minister, in a Sunday-rest convention in a neighboring State, said:—

"We want to touch legislation. We want to go over yonder into the capitol building and sit there among the law-makers with as much serenity and with as much right as do the lobbyists of the great corporations. We want to put our finger on the moral pulse of the legislature until they feel the power of our influence to the extent that they dare not refuse our demands."

This is how many of the advocates of reform(?) legislation hope to secure what they want. And to the shame of many politicians they have no more moral backbone than to yield to such "demands;" indeed the average professional politician is "all things to all men" with a vengeance, when he can reasonably count on their support to further his cause.

A good illustration of this we find in an old copy of the Chicago Daily Post of April 9, 1892, being an interview with a member of the House Committee on the World's Fair,—the particular subject up for discussion being the closing of the gates of the exposition on Sunday:—

"The reason we shall vote for it is, I will confess to you, a fear that, unless we do so, the church folks will get together and knife us at the polls; and—well you know we all want to come back, and we can't afford to take any risks."

"Do you think it will pass the House?"

"Yes; and the Senate, too. We are all in the same boat. I am sorry for those in charge of the Fair; but self-preservation is the first law of nature, and that is all there is about it."
