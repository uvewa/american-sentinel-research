God's power is eternal and unchanging. It is one and the same whether a world—a universe—is to be created, or a soul redeemed.

If any one has a doubt concerning God's ability to redeem, all he has to do is to look upon the material universe, and realize that the power that made it is the power that redeems.

This is one of the lessons to be learned from the language of inspiration found in Rom. 1:16–20. It reads: "For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth. . . . For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith. For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath showed it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse."

In this Scripture the apostle shows a direct connection between the power of God in the gospel and the power of God in creation—between redemption and creation.

More than once the apostle, in speaking of redemption, refers to the fact of creation. Col. 1:12–17. This is because creation is an aid to faith in the gospel.

Creation teaches (1) that God can redeem; and (2) that he will redeem.

As to the first there can be no controversy. If God by the simple utterance of a word could make a universe; and if, by that same word, he can uphold it and keep it in its place, surely he can take a sinner, steeped in sin, and so change him that he will be a new creation (2 Cor. 5:17, R. V., mar.) and give him power sufficient to enable him to comply with all the requirements of God.

But did God create the world in this way? Yes, verily. "By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. . . . For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast." Ps. 33:6,9. Moreover, by that same word, he upholds all thing; for thus it reads: "Who being . . . the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power." Heb. 1:3.

No one, then, believing the Bible account of creation, can possibly doubt God's ability to save "to the uttermost." But does creation teach that he will redeem?

In bringing this world into existence, God had a settled, fixed purpose. This is revealed in Isa. 45:18: "For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the Lord; and there is none else."

To defeat this purpose of God, Satan has used all the power of his giant intellect. By seducing man into sin, he hoped to bring about his destruction, and thus defeat God's plans. That he succeeded so far as getting man to sin is all too true. And had God not contemplated the possibility of sin entering, and thus his purpose being defeated, Satan would have succeeded in all that he designed so far as this earth is concerned.

But God did not create this earth in vain, he formed it to be inhabited, and therefore, even though sin, and consequently death, should enter, he had a plan, fully prepared from eternity, by which his purpose could be wrought out. That plan was the plan of redemption. It cannot be doubted, therefore, that creation teaches that God can and will redeem.

In creation, as we have already seen, his eternal power and divinity (R. V.) are revealed.

After God had fully completed his work, he instituted the Sabbath, and gave it to man to keep ever as a memorial of his creative power—as the sign of his eternal power and divinity. That sign will last as long as God's power and divinity can be seen in creation, and that of course will be to all eternity.

Now, as creation reveals that God can and will redeem, and is thus an aid to faith; and as the Sabbath is a sign of God's eternal power and divinity by which he will redeem, it inevitably follows that the Sabbath itself is an aid to faith.

Furthermore, this earth is a part of the universe that God created. When man sinned and fell, the earth itself became involved in the fall; and it must, with man, either be destroyed or redeemed. The latter, we have seen, is the truth, and thus it becomes evident that creation itself has a part in the redemptive scheme. It will therefore be still further evident that the Sabbath is not only a sign of God's eternal power in creation, but it is also a sign of his power in redemption.

What then follows? Simply this: He who knows the power of God in his creation and redemption can keep the Sabbath; and he who says he cannot keep it unless all others keep it, thereby acknowledges he does not know God's power. He cannot say truthfully that the gospel of Christ "is the power of God unto salvation." Let it be understood, however, that in all that has been said in this article relative to the Sabbath, in no instance is Sunday referred to.

The seventh day is the Sabbath set apart by Jehovah, and that day only is the sign of God's power in creation and redemption.

Having its origin in the work of creation, and being the memorial of the power that wrought in creation, it is entirely independent of any human aid, nor could it possibly receive it. This would be destructive of God's sovereignty.

In the very nature of things, then, anybody who knows the power of God in the gospel of Jesus Christ will have no difficulty in keeping the Sabbath—the seventh day.

But he who knows the power of God thus is a Christian, and if he does not know this power, he is not a Christian.

Then, beyond all doubt, anybody who is a Christian can keep the Sabbath; and, further, anybody who is a Christian and understands its nature and object will never say he cannot keep the Sabbath.

Circumstances of whatever kind will be no deterrent to a Christian. Environment will be no obstacle to him. He might be thrust into prison. But what of that? Many there are to-day who can testify that it is as easy to keep the Sabbath in a narrow cell as in a palace with none to molest.

Why is this? Because the Sabbath—the seventh day—is an inseparable part of that law that finds its source in Jesus Christ. No lock and key can keep out Jesus from a narrow prison cell where one of his saints is incarcerated, or anywhere else; and where Jesus is, there will Sabbath-keeping always be.

There is, then, something radically wrong with anybody, even though he happens to be a doctor of divinity, when he says, "My right to Sabbath observance depends upon a law for Sabbath observance for all. If others do not keep it, I can't."

The "Sabbath" in behalf of which this utterance was made is not, nor can it be, the Sabbath of the Bible; and consequently the religion that is represented by this kind of a "Sabbath" is not, nor can it be, the religion of Jesus Christ.
