The Rev. Dr. Lyman Abbott, of Brooklyn, is quoted as saying that a man who stays out of politics "because it is a dirty pool," is like John the Baptist, who "was afraid of temptation and ran away and hid in the wilderness." This comparison of Dr. Abbott's is not as bad as it might seem; for although there is not a shadow of Bible proof for the idea that John the Baptist "ran away and hid" in the wilderness, or that he "was afraid of temptation," there can be no doubt but that he did abstain completely from politics; so that the comparison has one point of truth upon which to rest. And there can be no doubt also but that the nature of politics was the same in the time of John the Baptist as it is now, and that he kept out of politics for a reason quite similar to that which prompts many people to do the same to-day.

And in this connection it is worth while to note the fact that keeping out of politics did not relegate John the Baptist to obscurity, or at all impair his power for usefulness. It is recorded of him that "Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about Jordan," "went out to him," "and were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins." He was not only out of politics, but he was away in the wilderness; yet he was probably the least hidden at the time of all the men in Judea. Yet while he was out of politics, and away from every seat of party strife, he was able to exert a direct influence upon those interests of the state with which politicians are supposed to deal. This fact in itself is good evidence that a man does not have to be a politician in order to serve the state.

If we read the account of John's work given in the third chapter of Luke, we shall discover in it several illustrations of this truth. Thus, in verse twelve and onward: "Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do? And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you. And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages." Here are disclosed the extortion and injustice of those in positions of power and the discontent of those receiving "wages," which are familiar features of the situation in our own country to-day, and which are made the basis of much of the oratory of a modern political campaign.

Times have not changed very much in our world since the days of John, so far as concerns the problems growing out of the relation between employer and employés, between the governed and their governors. Human nature was the same then that it is now, and expressed itself through substantially the same channels of conduct. And there is nothing in any of the circumstances of that time as compared with our own, which would warrant the conclusion that what was possible to one out of politics then, is not equally possible to one in the same position now.

The publicans and the soldiers—and we know not what other classes of the people—came out to John and asked of him in all sincerity what they should do in order to lead a better life. This is more than they asked of the politicians,—the party leaders,—and from John they learned more than the politicians would have been able to tell them. So that upon the inference that many of them acted in harmony with his counsel—a very fair inference, certainly—we may conclude that John the Baptist did more in his day to remove the discontent of the people and the causes therefor, and thus to aid in the maintenance of good government, than was done by all the politicians put together.

"Oh, but"—some of my readers will exclaim—"John the Baptist cannot serve as an example for our time, for his work was peculiar and extraordinary. He had a special message for the people from the Lord." Well, haven't preachers to-day a special message from the Lord? If not, they would better stop preaching. Haven't they the special message of the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth? Haven't they the message of repentance that John preached, and also the message which Jesus Christ himself proclaimed, of reconciliation with God through his death and resurrection? Haven't they, in short, all the message that John had and a good deal more,—as much more as Inspiration has added upon the pages of the New Testament?

Certainly they have. The only difference is that John stuck to his message, while the preachers of to-day don't stick to theirs, but seem to think they have found in politics something of more importance. If John the Baptist had gone into politics, he would have done as little for the real benefit of mankind as is being accomplished by the preacher politicians in our own midst. And if the latter would but proclaim the message of salvation in all the graciousness and power of the Spirit, as is their privilege, they might accomplish undreamed-of things in the line of relieving the painful and alarming symptoms which are apparent in the body politic at the present time. Let them try it and see.
