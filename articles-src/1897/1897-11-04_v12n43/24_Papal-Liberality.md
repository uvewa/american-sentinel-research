Recently at Kingston, Ont., there was a marriage in a Congregational church, at which a number of Catholics were witnesses. Upon learning of this, Archbishop Cleary, of that place, took occasion to set forth the liberality of papal principles in a public proclamation, as follows:

"We hereby declare with all the authority of the church vested in us as Archbishop of Kingston and your chief pastor, that any Catholic in our metropolitan city or diocese who shall hereafter presume to enter any non-Catholic edifice to assist at what is termed a marriage ceremony or service for the dead, even though he should not take any active part in the performance, renders himself guilty of mortal sin by dishonoring the religion of his baptism and defying the laws of the holy church and giving public scandal before society. We furthermore reserve to ourself alone the power to absolve from this heinous sin."
