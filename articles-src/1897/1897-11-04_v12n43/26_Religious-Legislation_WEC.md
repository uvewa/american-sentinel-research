Not long since, an advocate of Sunday laws said:—

"The seventh-day people have much to say about Sunday-enforcement laws infringing on personal rights. They are wrong, for such laws do not require that Sunday shall be kept religiously."

When the advocates of these laws first began to agitate for the enactment and enforcement of them, it was because "the day is not religiously kept." As soon as this sophistical bubble was punctured, they fell back and said that the law does "not require that Sunday shall be kept religiously."

But what is the "religious" observance of a day? A weekly rest-day is purely a religious institution—instituted by the Creator, and rest from labor is an essential part of its observance. In this act, an individual certainly appears to the world to be religious, and to comply with the requirements of the law from religious convictions.

So it is seen that any law requiring the cessation of labor on a day observed as the Sabbath, on the face of it, compels an outward recognition of what constitutes at least an essential part of its religious observance. But Sabbath-keeping is purely a duty to God, and to be acceptable must come from the heart. Any unwilling, outward regard for it, in compliance with statutory demands, makes the individual who does so a hypocrite. Religious laws are always enacted in behalf of some religion, to secure an unwilling recognition of it, else they never would be enacted. That is not the province of civil law; for a man with no religious convictions may be just as good a citizen as the most devout church member. Civil law recognizes only incivilities. It is not incivil to fail to observe any religious custom, so long as in this failure the right to observe it unmolested is granted to others.
