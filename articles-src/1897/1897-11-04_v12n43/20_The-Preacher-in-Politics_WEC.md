When the Author of the Christian religion came into the world, he made a very sharp distinction between his government and that of the world. One pertained to man's spiritual nature, the other to his physical well-being. As the people clamored to make him king, their disappointment knew no bounds when he refused. When his friends would resent the insults heaped upon him, he rebuked them with these words, "My kingdom is not of this world." His commission to his followers was, "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel,"—just one thing, and so we hear Paul declaring, "I am determined to know nothing save Jesus Christ and him crucified." This is the oneness of purpose that backed the efforts of the early Christians. The result was that in the face of a universal law prohibiting under penalty of death, the introduction of any other than the established religion, which was paganism, the gospel of the lowly Nazarene prospered and grew to mighty proportions.

Later the "mystery of iniquity" began its corrupting work, and it is not many pages that the historian wrote of those times till the sickening story of the Dark Ages begins—a story so full of awful deeds, all committed in the name of religion, that our cheeks blanche and the blood runs cold, and we shudder at the recital of the simple facts. This was all the result of a coalition of the civil with the ecclesiastical power.

Then came the Reformation—Luther with the primitive gospel of Jesus Christ—a gospel of love, a gospel of peace, a gospel of persuasion. In the face of apparently insurmountable obstacles, this gospel revolutionized all Europe, not by force of arms, but by its own inherent power—"the power of God unto salvation."

To-day we see and hear much of another gospel that the professed representatives of this same Jesus are teaching—a gospel of force, as embodied in the principles governing the Christian citizenship movement. So intoxicated are they with the idea that the nation can be made "Christian" in fact through legislation, that it is declared that "Christ is to become the Ruler of this nation," and that it will come "through the gateway of politics." Would that these same people could learn a lesson from the history of the fourth century! Would that they could realize that "all power is from above"—not from beneath; that to make men really good, their hearts must be changed, and only the power of God can do this—not the power of the state. Make a man first a good Christian and he will be a good citizen; so the work of the preachers, therefore, is to follow directly in the footsteps of the apostle Paul and preach nothing else "save Jesus Christ and him crucified." Why don't they do it?
