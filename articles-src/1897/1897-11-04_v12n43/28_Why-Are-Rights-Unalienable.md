NATURAL rights are unalienable because they are bestowed upon mankind by the Creator.

If some earthly power had created us,—if we had made ourselves, or been made by others like us, or by the state, we would have no unalienable rights at all; for the same earthly power that created us would have the right to dispose of us as it saw fit.

The state sometimes acts as though it were the creator of its people, and could dispose of their rights as it saw fit; but the state was itself created by the people, and it rests with the people to make such changes in the government as they see fit.

The state is created to serve the rights of the people; these rights do not lie at the disposal of the state.

Our rights are unalienable because they are necessary to serve the purpose God had in creating us. That purpose is—in this life—the formation of right character.

A right character can be developed only by the exercise of free choice.

The basis of right character is love—the love of good, true, and just principles. And all these find their embodiment and personification in God.

In the administration of God's government these principles find their highest exemplification.

God does not compel us to love him or any principle of his government. We cannot be compelled to love anything. We love whatever we do love from the exercise of our free choice.

Your parents do not punish you to force you to love what is good. And the state does not send men to prison to force them to love what is right and just. But the things that are good, and right, and pure, and just must be set before us, and exemplified over and over in words and acts; and by seeing their beauty and excellence, we learn to desire and love them. We choose to do this; and in this choosing we exercise an unalienable right.

If we were not allowed to choose whether we would serve God or not, the love of right principles could never become a part of our nature. Nothing can become a part of our natures which we do not put into them voluntarily. We must consent to let it into our hearts, before it can ever get there.

And if right principles were not a part of our very natures, we would not be fitted for an existence that would continue through eternity,—which is what the Creator designed for us.

If we are not permitted to choose whether we will keep the Sabbath or not, Sabbath-keeping cannot become a part of our natures; and without it we would never be admitted into the kingdom of God. And so with everything which pertains to the service of God.
