The engineer has turned on the power in the engine rooms, and all through the factory the shafting is turning. Not a machine moves. But let the operatives push the levers that make the connection, and the whole factory is quivering with activity.

God's promise is of power from on high for the daily life of overcoming. The power is at work all about us and in us. From out the throne of his power goes the influence that holds all the universe, and the life that flows through every living thing. What we want is to have that power turned into our spiritual lives, so that it may order our ways after the working of almighty power.

The lever is the Word. He is "upholding all things by the word of his power," or "his powerful word." Faith receives the Word into the life and makes the life a part of the living machinery of God's universe. Only think of it; all this power that can control the universe, turned to the ordering of our little lives! Is it not a glorious promise, and one to give us confidence and make glad our hearts?

Mr. J. E. Collins, of Noblesville, Ind., writes as follows of his estimate of the SENTINEL: "I am more than pleased with the paper itself. Its defense of personal liberty is certainly with unanswerable arguments and undeniable facts."
