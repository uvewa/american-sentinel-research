One of the four leading candidates for election to the office of mayor of "Greater New York" is conducting his campaign upon the platform of the principles of Jeffersonian democracy. In a recent newspaper interview he gave to a reporter the following forcible statement, contrasting the government of Jefferson's time with that of to-day, as regards its relation to the needs and rights of the people:

"They [Jeffersonian principles] can be summed up in the statement that a man has the right to do everything he pleases excepting to injure others; that the right use of government is to insure him this liberty, to defend him from injustice, and protect him in enjoying and using all advantages and opportunities which nature has provided.

"The government we have now is a long way from being a government of that kind.

"Jefferson believed that all just government rests on the consent of the governed—that the freest government is the best and most stable.

"We are going astray after the insane and criminal delusion that the best government is a government by force—the greater the force the better.

"If Jefferson were to come to New York to-day, the first thing which would strike him would be the presence here of a class of people who are doing their best to make our armories more impressive and more costly than our public schools.

"Jefferson taught that it is not necessary to kill people in order to govern them. He denied that any government had any right whatsoever to commit such wholesale, systematic, and persistent homicide as had been made the basis of all government up to his day. He asserted that the money which was being put into standing armies, navies, armories, and cannon, should be taken out and put into schools, churches, and colleges.

"When the Tories of his day cried out that this would result in anarchy and denounced him as a Jacobin and a dangerous character, he replied: 'Trust the people!'

"His whole system rests on those four immortal syllables, 'Trust the people.'

"A government which trusts the people will not take it for granted in advance that it will be necessary to shoot large numbers of them in order to maintain property rights. It will reason rather that property rights—the right to earn, to use all natural opportunities to the best advantage, and to enjoy each man the fruits of his own labor and skill—are the most sacred rights of the people, and that only the people themselves are the fit guardians of rights so inestimable.

"A Hazleton massacre would be impossible under a Jeffersonian government. In the first place, the monopolistic and fraudulent abuse of capital responsible for it would be impossible. In the second, honest capital, honestly employed, would no longer have that fear of the people and of the reality of popular government which now inspires such occasional manifestations of monopolistic ferocity as that at Hazleton.

"Jefferson believed, and I believe with him, that the people have the right to bear arms and to organize themselves into militia for their own defense and the defense of their government, but he did not believe in any military organization in the form of militia or otherwise to be used as the basis for a government conducted on the idea that it is necessary to coerce the people and hold them down with the bayonet in order to have good government.

"That is the most insane and wicked delusion the devil ever disseminated on earth. Jefferson thought so, and I am glad to have learned to think with him.

"It was from Jefferson, too, that I learned to believe in the right of the people to the fullest enjoyment of every opportunity nature gives them. His principles force every man who really holds them into active opposition to monopoly wherever it is found; whether it is in the streets of New York, in the coal mines of Pennsylvania, in the prairies of the West, or in the cotton-fields of the South.

"To be a Jeffersonian Democrat is to be ready to give every man his due—first his life in not shooting him in order to govern him; second, his liberty in not locking him up in order to correct his theological or ethical views; third, his right to all the happiness he is capable of enjoying by a full use of every advantage nature has provided for the human race.

"Jefferson thought it preposterous for a few men to claim a right to the ownership of the world, including land and everything else in it they thought worth having, so that they could say to the rest: 'Do as we tell you or get off the earth.'

"He was right. It was preposterous. Nothing could be more so. What the Jeffersonian Democrats propose to do now is to demonstrate it."

But the trouble is that real believers in Jeffersonian principles of government are in a hopeless minority today. And they are about as scarce among the workingmen as among any other class of the people. Jefferson was as far from being a socialist as he was from being a plutocrat.
