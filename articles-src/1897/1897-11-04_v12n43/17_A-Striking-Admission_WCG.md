At the World's W. C. T. U. convention, just closed at Toronto, a letter was received from Lady Henry Somerset, of England, widely known both in Europe and America as an active worker, and vice-president of the union. The following extract from the letter would seem to indicate that this distinguished lady has a clear perception of the animating spirit that has so largely taken possession of her fellow workers in this great organization. After expressing her regret at being unable to be present, she says:—

"Looking back from the vantage ground of the nineteenth century we condemn unhesitatingly the spirit of the inquisitions; and yet if we dissect the motives which prompted those appalling evils, we find that the root principle was not one wholly of evil, but wholly mistaken, namely, that all who differed had to be brought into line for the welfare of the race, and that any means to this end was justifiable; that to hate the individual meant to be loyal to principles that were believed to come from God; and I think that if we examine our motives, we shall find that something of this spirit governs us, and that we, too, feel that where we differ, we may almost claim the spirit of avenging angels. And so I know that in your great gatherings you will sometimes pause to think that 'love suffers long and is kind; love thinketh no evil, rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth,' and that it may be possible sometimes that those who do not see eye to eye with us are yet acting from motives which are absolutely sincere, motives perhaps, purer, even purer than ours. This is the message that I should like to send across the waters which separate me from my comrades as they meet."

Will this message be heeded? Will the W. C. T. U. continue to forget that it is not only a temperance union but a *Christian* Temperance Union, in name at least, and that its methods and spirit should be Christlike?

This warning has been repeated from without, many times; now that it comes from within, at the hands of one whose devotion to Christian work cannot be disputed, its effect upon the minds of the more careful and conservative in the organization ought to be apparent in checking the growing tendency on the part of so many of its members toward religious legislation and the spirit of the Inquisition.
