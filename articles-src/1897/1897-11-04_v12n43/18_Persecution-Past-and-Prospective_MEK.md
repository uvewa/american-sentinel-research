The persecutions of past ages were the result of the desire of the priests of the dominant church, as they conceived it, to improve the condition of the people. The system of reasoning by which they justified such a course was very simple. The church had come, or thought it had, to the perfection of light and knowledge both as regards this world and the world to come. The church conceived itself to be the divinely appointed teacher of the world. Whatever it thought was best to be done, should be done; and objectors, for the good of the state and community, and for their own good, too, should be compelled, if need be, to do what the church held to be right.

To those resting upon this self-satisfactory basis, all arguments in regard to personal accountability to God and of individual rights in religious matters had no effect. They appealed to infallible authority,—to the Scriptures, which speak of evil doers being rooted out from the earth, and they regarded themselves as the appointed agents of the Most High to carry out the decrees of the divine will. Thus religious zeal became synonymous with human cruelty. The cruelest deeds and the most pious phrases went hand in hand; prayer and murder became boon companions.

Persecuting heathenism was barely a thing of the past, when its place was taken by what passed for the church of Jesus Christ; all freedom of thought was repressed; and if a Savonarola saw a purer faith, or a Galileo discovered a new scientific truth, the advocating of it could only be done at the price of life.

This was in the days when one church—one vast system of religion—held all states and almost all people in bondage, making the acceptance of its dogmas, either willingly or by constraint, the price of every earthly blessing, and even of life itself. The physical agonies endured by the martyrs to civil and religious liberty in those dark centuries have occupied the thoughts, engaged the pen, and aroused the sympathies of the philosophers and philanthropists of modern times; but who can picture the mental agony, the conflict of mind, when abject submission and credulous faith, with safety, were opposed by some illuminations of the Holy Spirit, or flashes of reason, leading into paths dangerous to tread! How many human souls went through life groping in thick darkness, trembling before creed and dogma, until the man created in the image of God, was made, by what claimed to be the church of God, but a lump of clay, without thought, inert, doubting the sincerity of his own faith, fearing the results of his own unbelief, trembling between hope and fear,—how many such lives those ages afforded, nothing but the recording angel's pen can reveal.

That deadly spell was partially broken in the sixteenth century. Men were no longer content to doubt and suffer in silence; they arose and in a new-born strength begotten of God, who in his time bursts the captive's yoke, proclaimed soul liberty. The spirit of liberty pervaded all nations. It crossed the ocean, and in the wilds of the American wilderness built a state, whose national motto, "A new order of things," suggested freedom from both civil and ecclesiastical tyranny. For a time liberty became the watchword of the world; kings pretended to embrace it or fell before it; popes were taken prisoner or fled from their capital as fugitives,—and liberty everywhere seemed like a triumphant conqueror.

But again a change has come. Liberty is like the sea, which has its ebbing and its flowing time; its spring floods and neap tides. Men still rave of liberty, philosophers describe her flowing robes, poets sing her praises, the statesman descants upon her in the legislative halls, and the church holds her as an ideal; but her face is turned from us. She is a beautiful, but a fading dream. How else can we account for the fact that in Europe kings are becoming more supreme and constitutions are little regarded; that the war lord has become greater than the statesman; that the papacy is tightening her grip on Spain and Austria; that she is slowly but steadily regaining her lost ground in Germany, France, Italy, and England; that the cries of suffering peoples in two hemispheres, who are struggling for liberty, are smothered by moneyed interests; and that in our own favored land, where liberty once fled to find the refuge denied to her in the Old World, the churches, which form the greatest motive power in all affairs, are deliberately planning to enact laws directly aimed at personal liberty in those things which relate to man in his individual relations to God?

The churches declare their intention of uniting so that they can be one church under one head, and so gain the control of the nation and dictate its laws. The *Christian Statesman*, in a recent issue, compares the leading Protestant churches to the fingers of a man's hand, but as the open hand does not bring the churches' desire, it says, "What is needed is the compacting of fingers and thumb into a solid fist wielded by the controlling purpose of a single brain, and then something will drop, and drop hard."

What does this plan outline but a new papacy? Surely something will then drop, and that something will be religious liberty. It may be said by some one in extenuation of this utterance, that this proposed union, by which everything opposing is to be crushed, is only for the promotion of morality in civil things; but the pages of history are eloquent of the fact that when a great religious organization sets itself to work to carry certain ends, it has a very poor sense of discrimination in regard to what are religious and what are civil things; or, in other words, from its standpoint there is no dividing line. By a subtle alchemy of church policy, religious things are transformed into civil. It was so when Rome persecuted. All her cruel, religious exactions were transformed into civil requirements. She shook her "fist of righteousness" through the civil power at those who refused her dogmas.

Protestants, departing from the simplicity of their earlier days, are following her example. They are becoming "compacted" for that purpose. The open palm of friendship and invitation is tightening into the grip of despotic hate and fancied divine retribution. Tired of presenting the love of God, the church would appropriate his prerogative of punishment. This is the attitude of a large number of the professed Christian ministers of America. In blind zeal they are crowding the nation nearer and nearer to the brink of a frightful precipice. Already we have seen some of the results of this misguided zeal; the future bids fair to reveal it in greater measure.
