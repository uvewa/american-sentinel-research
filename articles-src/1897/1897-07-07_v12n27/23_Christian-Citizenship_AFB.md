"CHRISTIAN CITIZENSHIP" is the name of a new movement which has for its object the regeneration of society by means of Christian laws, made and administered by Christian men. That society needs regenerating, no Christian will deny. That the church, with its present methods, has utterly failed to regenerate society, is equally apparent.

In view of these patent facts, it was seen that something must be done, and that soon. Consequently, at the annual meeting of the National Reform Association, held at Allegheny, Pa., Nov. 16, 1893, its secretary, Rev. H. H. George, sounded the key-note of Christian Citizenship in the following words:

"I will never say a word disparagingly of evangelistic work. But I do think the church is making a mistake in so confining herself to that work, as if the prospect of saving the soul was the great end. The tremendous power of the government is against us. If that were not so, they would be converted by nations, so to speak. But when the government is against the conversion of nations, we are moving against the tremendous machinery of the government in working for the conversion of men. You go down to Washington to-day, and there is a saloon in both houses of Congress; and so the influence is spreading all over the country. Now we are working right against the power of this and everything else. I do not know but it would be better to stop evangelistic effort, if possible, if this other work would be made successful, and go to converting men by nations—nations full of men—rather than to try to save one man against the tremendous machinery of a nation like this, whose influence is very largely against the conversion of souls; while, if it could be turned in that direction, they could be saved by thousands instead of one. So I think the great question of the hour is the conversion of this nation to Christ."

Since the time of this utterance there has been a marvelous change in the means and methods of Christian workers. Pastors and evangelists have come to devote less time to revival work, and more time to political reforms. The brethren of the congregations have been counseled to "leave the prayer-meetings with the sisters, and attend the primaries," and "pull wires for the kingdom of God." They have been told that "when the primary and the prayer-meeting are held on the same night, the true prayer-meeting is the primary."—"Christian Citizenship," by Carlos Martyn, p. 65, Funk & Wagnall Co., New York.

It is well known that the National Reform Association has for many years urged that the salvation of this nation depended upon securing an amendment to the national Constitution, accepting Christ as the ruler of the nation, and the Bible as the basis of all legislation. By this it was hoped to convert the nation to Christ. All members of this association are greatly encouraged by the change which this Christian Citizenship movement has wrought in the means and methods of church work. Rev. J. T. McCrory, of Pittsburg, Pa., a leading official in the National Reform Association, and president of the Pennsylvania Christian Endeavor Society, referred to the change at the Washington Convention, 1896 (Official Report, p. 125), in these words:

"Let me call your attention first to the fact that the aspect of the cross is undergoing a great change in this regard. There was a time, not so long ago either, when the cross was viewed almost exclusively in reference to the salvation of the individual. . . . Now, if I understand it aright, it is one purpose of this great Endeavor movement to enthrone Christ in our national life. . . . Over yonder, in Scotland, they have just been engaged in doing honor to the martyrs of former centuries. Who were these men? They were the men who sought in their day to get Christ into national life, and they lost their heads for it. They stood, in their day, for what they called the crown rights of King Jesus,—the same thing precisely that the Christian Citizenship movement of Christian Endeavor stands for in this country to-day."

If the agitation for a formal national recognition of Christianity, or for the enactment of laws with a view to advancing the kingdom of God,—if such agitation is a desirable change from old paths of Christian work, then Christians have reason to rejoice. If devoting less time to saving men as individuals and more time to saving men as nations is an indication of a return to apostolic power and purity, then the omens are promising. For no intelligent observer can fail to discern this change in means and methods of church work. If, however, this change is for the worse instead of for the better, then this radical transformation should startle every friend of evangelical Christianity.

There are many who deplore this new departure. They see in it a movement away from New Testament principles.

The Herald and Presbyter. of June 3, 1896, contained these weighty words:

"The gospel began its mission for the renovation of the world with the exhortation, 'Repent and be baptized every one of you.' It did not direct its efforts to institutions, but to individuals. And so it must be now. So it will be if the Spirit is poured out. To talk about the revival of civic righteousness as the great need of the times is reversing the divine order; it is putting the effect before the cause; it is trying to build the house without gathering the material. We cannot have a Christian city without Christian citizens. Men's hearts must be renewed before we can hope for new social and civic conditions. Let us labor and pray for what people nowadays sneer at as 'an old fashioned revival'—of the fashion of the first revival when Peter preached on the streets of Jerusalem."

Rev. Arthur S. Burrows, pastor of the First Baptist church of Charlestown, Boston, Mass., writes thus in opposition to the employment of governmental power to further the gospel:

"Soul-freedom is the bulwark of religious liberty, the inevitable outgrowth of the New Testament principles, that each must hear for himself, must repent for himself, must believe for himself, must confess Christ for himself, must be baptized on his own confession (Rom. 14:22). We come into this world one by one, we must go to Christ one by one for his pardoning grace, and we leave this world one by one to be rewarded according to our works, if we be Christ's, and to be judged if we be not Christ's (2 Cor. 5:10). Hence the State has no authority over the religious beliefs and observances of men, whether orthodox or heretic, atheist or heathen."—From "For What Does a Baptist Church Stand?"

The *Christian Advocate* (Methodist, New York), of April 29, 1897, in reply to a question whether a Methodist minister should follow the political plans pursued by a prominent clergyman in New York City, in attempting to create a better public sentiment, replied in part with this gospel advice:

"The true course of the individual pastor who desires to create a better public sentiment than exists, is to deepen the tone of piety and conscientiousness in his own church; to consider that it is by the church in its normal life that the community is to be raised permanently."

Jesus said: "Tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high." Luke 24:49.

Jesus did not say: "Tarry ye in the halls of legislation, until ye be endued with power from the State."

Jesus said: "Ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you." Acts 1:8.

Jesus did not say: "Ye shall receive power after ye have gained control of legislation."

Jesus said: "Without me ye can do nothing." John 15:5.

Jesus did not say: "Without the power of the State ye can do nothing."

"Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts." When Peter and the rest of the apostles, filled with the Holy Spirit, began evangelistic work on the day of Pentecost, they were outlaws in every country under heaven. Imperial Rome ruled the world. The death penalty hung over the head of him who would teach a new doctrine. But "against the tremendous machinery of the government" three thousand were converted in one day. And just as long as the church trusted alone in the Holy Spirit, she went forth conquering and to conquer. And just in proportion as the church began to "pull wires for the kingdom of God" at the court of Constantine, in that same proportion she lost power with the Prince of Peace. The church stopped converting men by individuals, and began "converting men by nations," and immediately there appears the "Holy Roman Empire."

The Reformation of the sixteenth century, whose power, like an earthquake, shook the throne of the papal pontiff, was but the natural result of turning from the arm of flesh to the arm of God. When Luther was urged to appeal to the State for aid in furtherance of the Reformation, he quickly replied: "There is no sword that can further this cause, God alone must do everything." "It is with the Word that we must fight, by the Word must we overthrow and destroy what has been set up by violence." "Christians fight, not with sword or muskets, but with suffering and with the cross. Christ their captain handled not the sword; . . . he hung on the tree."

D'Aubigné, the historian of the Reformation, contrasting the power of the Reformation with the power of Rome, uttered these inspired words: "Rome had been established by the law of a carnal commandment; the Reformation by the power of an endless life." "The gospel of the Reformation had nothing to do with the world and with politics. While the Roman hierarchy had become a matter of court intrigue, the Reformation was destined to exercise no other influence over princes and people than that which proceeds from the gospel of peace."

All evangelical Christians now freely admit this early apostasy. They admit that friendship with the world, and reliance on human power, caused this ruin. They also agree that the power of the Reformation resulted from reliance alone on the power of God. Then why do they not cry out against this modern reunion with the world? It will cost the friendship of a world-loving, compromising church; but it will bring its reward.

"Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins."

"If thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand."

Let the watchman give the trumpet a certain sound. Let him enter into his closet and shut to the door, and plead for "power from on high," that with all boldness he may speak the word.

In closing, we step aside to let another cry aloud against the worldward tendency of the church, but join with C. H. Spurgeon and George C. Needham in a fervent "Amen."

"Renounce all the policy of the age. Trample upon Saul's armor. Grasp the book of God. Trust the Spirit who wrote its pages. Fight with this weapon only, and always. Cease to amuse; and seek to arouse. Shun the clap of a delighted audience, and listen for the sobs of a convicted one. Give up trying to 'please' men who have only the thickness of their ribs between their souls and hell; and warn, and plead, and entreat, as those who feel the waters of eternity creeping upon them.

"Let the church again confront the world; testify against it; meet it only behind the cross; and, like her Lord, she shall overcome, and, with him, share the victory. O Spirit of the Lord, bless this witness!"†
