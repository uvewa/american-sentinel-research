It is reported from Paris that the Roman Catholic priest who preached the funeral sermon for the victims of the late dreadful disaster in that city, in his discourse represented God as demanding a holocaust of good, charitable, believing people to appease his anger against the freethinkers and other sinners of the gay French capital. This is quite in harmony with the pagan conception of God which leads men to torture themselves with various forms of penance in order to appease his wrath or move him to pity. The Christian conception of God is expressed in the Scripture, "God is love," and "God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself." There is plenty of paganism which tries to pass for Christianity.
