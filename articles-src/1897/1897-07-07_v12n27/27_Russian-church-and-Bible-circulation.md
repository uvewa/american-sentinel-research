The Holy Synod of the Russian church is seriously discussing the question whether or not to encourage the circulation of the Scriptures in the vast empire of the czars. The rulers of the Orthodox Greek church have never taken up the position of the Roman communion that the Bible in the hands of the laity is a dangerous book when not accompanied by the commentaries and explanations of the church; but a strong body of the clergy exists which looks upon the free circulation of the Bible among the masses of the people as something, nevertheless, which contains the elements of perils to the church. The present metropolitans of St. Petersburg and Kieff are of this opinion; so is M. Pobiedonosteff, the powerful lay member of the synod. On the other hand, Russian law confers on the synod the monopoly of printing the Scriptures in the Russian and Slavonic languages, and as it is a body in chronic want of money, its business managers recognize that the more Bibles and Testaments are put into circulation, the greater will be the income of the synod from their sale. The circulation of Bibles, New Testaments and portions within the empire, including Russian Poland, exceeds three quarters of a million copies, of which probably half a million are editions by the Holy Synod. It will be interesting to watch the conflict between those who maintain that the stability of the church is endangered by unrestricted Bible circulation, and those who favor it as a source of vast revenue.—N.
