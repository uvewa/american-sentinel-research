"The rules at West Point," says the Independent (N. Y.), of July 1, "do require cadets to attend divine service on Sunday at the cadet chapel, unless they prefer, 'on the ground of their religious faith or conscientious objections' to 'attend some other place of worship.' No conscience is forced."

In other words, no conscience is forced when cadets are required "to attend divine service on Sunday," either at the Government chapel or at some other. Can this be true? How about those cadets who may prefer not to attend divine service at any chapel? Is such preference to be regarded as evidence that they have no conscience at all? And are not the other cadets compelled to attend the service of their preference? Can compulsion and freedom of choice unite in dictating the same course of action? If the individual submits to compulsion, does he still retain his freedom?

The same thing is illustrated in many of the State Sunday laws, which provide that observers of the seventh day shall not be compelled to observe the first day of the week, provided they do conscientiously refrain from work on the seventh day.

Such requirements cannot be in harmony with freedom of conscience.
