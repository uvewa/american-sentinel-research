BY M. E. KELLOGG.

A correspondent of the Interior, who is a Doctor of Divinity, in a late number of that paper, gives a very interesting description of the way the Sultan of Turkey visits the mosque on Friday to pray. He is not charitable enough to admit that he goes to the mosque for any other purpose than to be seen of men, which, of course, may be true, but it is a well-known fact that tens of thousands of professed Christians go to church for the same purpose. But of all the statements made in regard to the Sultan, the most remarkable, to the writer, was the following: "Such is the way the despot of the Bosphorus who is so heartily and affectionately hated by all Christians makes his progress to his place of devotion."

An inspired apostle has instructed Christians that they should pray for kings and for all that are in authority. This does not mean good kings alone; indeed at the time when the apostle wrote those words the greatest monarchs of the earth were opposed to Christianity, and so, of course, there was greater need of praying for them. Another apostle has instructed us to "honor the king." The question is whether the Christians of the Sultan's dominions have obeyed these injunctions? If Paul and Peter could honor Nero and pray for him, why should not the Armenian Christians who live in the Sultan's dominions pray for him? It is highly probable that if they had prayed more and plotted less many lives might have been spared.

But to the most interesting point: Do Christians hate Abdul Hamid? Granting even that he is their enemy, should they hate him? Here are some words from Christ, the Author and Founder of Christianity: "For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those who love them. And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same. And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again. But love ye your enemies and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil." Luke 6:32-35.

Now, in view of these words, if we hate anyone, even the Sultan of Turkey, are we Christians? Or, in other words, Is it Christian to hate? The fact that it probably may be truthfully said that the majority of professed Christians actually hate the Sultan is a sad reminder that actual Christians are not nearly so numerous as they are supposed to be.

The power of love as seen in the early church conquered heathenism and Rome. Is there any better way of subduing Mohammedanism and Turkey?

The most powerful force in the universe is love.
