Popularity is an assumed test of worth and wisdom. It is taken for granted that the man most talked about is the best guide, the party polling the most votes must represent timely ideas, and the daily with the most flaring headlines must be nearest the truth. But no reasoning could be more unsound, as all history proves. Somehow the righteous minority, the saving remnant, does not stay vanquished, but manages to snatch the prize of victory at the last moment. From the days of Gideon's three hundred and the famous Daniel's band, to these closing days of the nineteenth century, God has never forsaken the "faithful few," but has used them to accomplish His wonders in the earth. There is a positive advantage in being on the side of the minority, always provided that the minority is on the side of God and great ideals, for God is multitudinous above all the nations of the earth.—Union Signal.
