The London correspondent of the New York Times, Mr. Harold Frederic, speaks in a recent letter of the progress of the Romeward movement in the Established church. He says that recently the new Bishop of London displayed a mitre, the first one seen in St. Paul's since the Reformation. He reports a large advance in the employment of the confessional and mentions a recent early morning service in a parish church where he saw "twenty nun-clad women of a Church-of-England order who, during prayers, bowed at the name of Jesus but knelt at the mention of the Virgin Mary."
