# News, Notes, and Comment.

The great distinctive characteristic which differentiates the religion of the Master from all other religious systems in the world is its absolute separation from the State, its perfect independence of the civil power, its flat repudiation of the "arm of the flesh," its perfect trust in "the sword of the Spirit." This idea had never occurred to any of those who had set up as moral guides for the people, or directors of their political destinies. It was a new and a strange doctrine. It was nothing short of a revolution in human thought. There was no germ of such a conception in any existing philosophy or cult.

***

The great Confucius put the offering of sacrifices among his "eight objects of government," and mentions as a matter of course the appointment of a "Minister of Religion" to preside over the sacred ceremonies of the country, and "regulate the services paid to the spirits and gods." Plato was so fully persuaded in his own mind not only that religion was a State matter, but that it was exclusively a State matter, that he discountenanced private or household devotions altogether, and, in his ideal commonwealth, proposed to compel every person to attend to these things in the public temples. He declared that among the greatest evils in civil affairs was "ignorance of the true God"—meaning the god provided by the State for the worship of its citizens—and that "he who disturbed the foundations of religion disturbed the foundations of the State"—meaning that one who did not "conform" to the church by law instituted was necessarily a traitor.

***

Aristotle sang the same strain. Chief among all the necessities of a State, he placed "the service of the gods." For them, he held the temples ought to be built at the expense of the community, and for their worship men "ripe for the priesthood" should be "set apart" by the government; for subordinate branches of the public ritual, he would have "magistrates" assigned, leaving the more important and gorgeous ceremonials for the priesthood proper. Cicero devotes one book of the three which compose his work "On the Laws," as it now stands to the exposition of a system of ecclesiastical regulations, such as he deemed an essential part of a perfect polity.

***

The "fathers" and people of the early church were deeply tainted with this pagan notion. It was under its dominating influence that the bishops entered into that "dark intrigue" with Constantine, whereof the first fruit was the first Sunday law. St. Augustine thus frankly warned the Britons: "If you will not unite with us in showing the Saxons the way of life, you shall receive from them the stroke of death"—meaning to frighten them into a nominal submission to the See of Rome, as the only condition in which they would be aided in the defense of their homes. And these same Britons declared that their kingdom was "held of Christ."

***

None of the great "reformers" succeeded in shaking off this intellectual yoke completely. Luther started out well, but when the time came that he could avail himself of the temporal power he so detested while it worked the will of the papacy, he was not proof against temptation. The avowed aim of Zwinglius was to establish a theocracy after his own heart, which should crush with pike and sword the un-Christianized peoples of Europe, and smite the Romanists hip and thigh. Wycliffe was, for his followers as to doctrine, a pope and Ecumenical Council on a small scale, as well as a "regulator" of life.

***

Coming down to later times, we find many philosophers and statesmen saturated with the same fallacy. Machiavelli did not hesitate to enumerate among the duties of rulers close attention to "all the circumstances and events" of a national life "however false or frivolous soever they may appear to themselves." Bismarck never doubted the expediency, nay, the substantial necessity, of a State-established and State-supported church. Gladstone has written himself down as of like opinion. Macaulay could not express frankly a contrary view. Coleridge maintained that we must have "national faith," and that the State "has a right to demand of the national church that its instructions should be fitted to diffuse throughout the people legality, that is, the obligations of a well-calculated self-interest, under the conditions of a common interest, determined by common laws." And Mr. Matthew Arnold considered that all who oppose a union of Church and State "think unworthily" both of government and religion.

***

It has been well said that man is so inconsistent a creature that there is no reasoning from his belief—meaning, of course, his professed belief—to his conduct, or from any one part of his belief to any other part. This fact is perfectly familiar to every student of physiology, and is often forced upon the consideration of the most superficial observer of his own kind. But surely it is a monstrous thing, and one worthy of every effort to eradicate, that those who profess and call themselves Christians should tolerate for an instant in their own minds the slightest inclination toward a united Church and State. There can really be no question of expediency about the subject, so far as a Christian is concerned. A Christian has one Authority, and one only for his view of the nature and scope of religion. When he finds out what this Authority has to say, there is, for him, an end of the matter. All the glamour of an establishment does not dazzle him. All the arguments of "police" that professors of philosophy, or self-chosen "heads" of the people can bring to bear, do not move him. What does the Master teach? "My kingdom is not of this world;" "The kingdom of God is within you;" "Put up again thy sword into its place; for all they that take the sword shall perish by the sword,"—and so on.

* * *

So that we must abandon this particular inconsistency of trying to follow the Master, and, at the same time, trying to mix and intermingle religion with civil affairs, if we would be more than professional Christians. Plainly he who will only be worshiped "in spirit and in truth," is not to be worshiped under the superintendence of a public purveyor of spectacles. Plainly the kingdom which is not of this world is not to be served in any manner whatsoever by the machinery of kingdoms that are altogether of this world. What Confucius thought about such religion as he saw around him is nothing to us. That a later generation imported into Christianity the theories and practices of paganism is nothing to us. That neither Matthew Arnold nor Macaulay could so resist the glitter and grandeur and hoary antiquity of the "Established Church of England as to 'think straight and see clear' in the premises, is nothing to us. We have His Word.

* * *

It is certainly and painfully true that many excellent persons, besides the great men mentioned above, are unwilling to take Him at His word, and are strenuously striving, day and night, to establish for Him a kingdom which is somewhere else than "within" the heart and mind of the race. And it is also true that many such are quite sincerely oblivious of their own inconsistency thus manifested. I was talking a few days ago to one of these people. He dwelt at some length on the uselessness of laws to make people really good. He laid it down with dogmatic emphasis that this was the work of "the Spirit," and could be done by "the Spirit" alone. Then the conversation drifted to some other topic, and at last we got to talking about "Sunday laws." On this subject, he waxed eloquent again. He declared, among other things, that in his belief, the whole morality (sic) of the nation was bound up with these enactments; that if they were swept away, the very basis of society would be shaken—with other propositions of like meaning and phraseology. I let him talk awhile, and then asked him how he reconciled the assertion that only "the Spirit" could make men moral, with his position that our national morality—conceding that there could be any such thing—is dependent on Sunday legislation for its existence and maintenance. I have not yet received my answer.

* * *

One would think that this great distinctive "trademark" of the Master's religion—this attribute so grand, so great, so absolutely and exclusively its own, would be the constant theme of sermons in Christian churches, and of conversation wherever religion is spoken of among Christians. One would expect to see the force of this wonderful doctrine displaying itself in every manifestation of Christian life, private and communal; that missionaries would use it in their first attempts to open the way for the gospel in the savage soul. Alas! The missionary too often arrives as the accredited minister of a church which has already lived for centuries on the mammon of unrighteousness. The savage too often sees in his visitors only rivals of his own priesthood, who would substitute themselves for the latter in the capacity of a State-supported hierarchy, with all that the words imply.

* * *

There is always something unpleasant about the way in which nations of the higher or more civilized type deal with those lower in the scale of humanity. The cool robbery of our Indians by England, France and Spain, and the cruelties practiced by the conquerors of South and Central America, form discreditable chapters of history. And so, in the taking possession of India, England committed many atrocious acts, and defied the principles of common justice over and over again. But England has a genius for governing as remarkable as her appetite for new colonies. And it forms a legitimate subject for congratulations to Her Majesty in connection with the great Jubilee, that the vast Indian empire is one of the most peaceful and contented portions of her territory at the present time. The fact fairly entitles India to be spoken of as "one of the brightest jewels in England's crown."

* * *

In nothing have the English exhibited more tact than in their dealing with the religious sensibilities of that wonderful Indian population. No different sects of so-called Christians have ever hated each other with more bitterness than do the Mahommedans and Buddhists of Hindostan. To keep the peace between them, while extending no undue favor to either sect, is a task which has called forth the highest qualities of British statesmanship. Incidentally, it has broadened the English mind, and undoubtedly done an immense deal of good by leading, at any rate, toward that much to be desired, but apparently unattainable goal—the absolute equality of all religions and of no religion before the law among English-speaking nations.

* * *

In India, for example, it is, as usually with us, a profanation of a Christian church for a man to enter and remain in one with his hat on his head; and, accordingly, to do so is disorderly conduct. On the other hand, with that curious way the Orientals have of doing just the opposite of what we do in many things, it is a profanation of a Buddhist temple for a man to enter it with his shoes on his feet. And that is likewise considered disorderly conduct by English law, as administered in Hindostan, and is punished accordingly. And now that learned Hindooes have taken up with English ways, and are gradually coming to share in the government of their country, under English auspices, and English direction, it is no uncommon thing for a native Hindoo magistrate to sentence an Englishman for his infraction of some custom or usage dear to the Hindoo heart for religious reasons alone.

***

Perhaps the time may come when the "higher education" of the natives should be so diffused that there will arise a considerable body of men who will object to foreign domination and develop a capacity for organization and discipline which will endanger the white man's rule. But that event is far distant, if, indeed, it shall ever occur. From their writings, it appears that cultured Hindooes are rather disposed to regard English rule as a welcome release from the internal contentions which for so long a period preceded its establishment, and as the only reliable safeguard against their re-appearance. Altogether, Her Majesty has reason to be proud of India.

***

Some interesting figures have lately been given, showing the comparative weight of Bibles and cartridges which the soldiers of different armies are required—or allowed—to carry. If my memory serves me, it appeared that Germany gave more weight, so to speak, to the instruments of murder than England, in proportion to the legal weight of Scripture, considered as an item of military equipment, while France almost disregarded the good Book altogether in fitting out her soldiers.

***

Certain writers have tried hard to extract some fun out of these disclosures, but it is no laughing matter. Little matters like these have a moral, and the moral of them is that the two things, war and Christianity, are incompatible, and can by no means be made to harmonize. The incongruity is what suggests humor in the instance now under consideration. It is, of course, apparent on the surface of the statement. But it is an incongruity to be contemned, not laughed it.

***

The spirit of religion, as we understand it, is the spirit of peace. Men will go to war to the end of time, as they have done from its beginning, on all sorts of pretexts, sometimes self deceived as to their own motives, sometimes seeking to deceive others in regard to their reasons for so doing, sometimes with brutal candor confessing the unrighteousness of their controlling impulse. But under any and all circumstances, war is a thing outside of the pale of Christianity. There may be a human standard of conduct, measured by which a war is not only a right, but a duty—as in case of an unwarranted invasion of a country. But Christianity, like ordinary municipal law, is "silent in the clash of arms." The Gospel and the cartridge are not properly placed in the same knapsack.
