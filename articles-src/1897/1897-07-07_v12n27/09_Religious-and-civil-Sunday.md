"In order that every man may enjoy the religious Sunday," said the Rev. Mr. Reed, of Haverhill, Mass., in a recent discourse, "every man must observe the civil Sunday." Was it then an oversight on the part of the Creator that in his Sabbath commandment he makes no allusion to a civil sabbath, or provision for its observance? Sunday observance, to be sure, is not commanded by the Creator, but if it were, could not one person observe it independently of the actions of some other persons? Is our obedience to God dependent upon the uncertainty of the obedience of others around us? We think not.
