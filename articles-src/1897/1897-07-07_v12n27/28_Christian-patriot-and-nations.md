"The Christian patriot", says a religious journal, "will now pray and labor that our nation may have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ". How can this be? Did Jesus Christ die for the governments of the world? And can a government believe unto righteousness? Would a profession of belief expressed in the Constitution of the nation constitute faith in Christ? Such questions answer themselves. Let each individual person find peace by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ, and the nation will take care of itself. God wants men, not governments. He has a better government to set up than any to be found on the earth; but he has no men, only such as he can obtain from this earth by the power of his grace. Man is in the image of God, and is therefore very dear to him. A single being in his image, is dearer to God than all the governments in the world.
