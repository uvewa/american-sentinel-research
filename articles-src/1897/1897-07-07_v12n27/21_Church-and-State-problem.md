The relation of Church and State has been the vexed problem of the civilization of the centuries. The unholy alliance between Church and State has been the principal disturber of the peace of nations. Whenever the Christian church has sought the favor of rulers or governments it has been a subject and not a sovereign.

Whenever rulers or governments have sought the favor of the Church they have become the abject slaves of ecclesiasticism, the worst bondage ever known to man. Under monarchical government there is a State religion, and religious liberty, if enjoyed at all, is granted as a privilege and not conceded as a right; whereas religious liberty is never a privilege but always a right.—Rev. Jas. M. King, Secretary National League for Protection of American Institutions.
