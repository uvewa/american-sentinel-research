THE second Sunday after the recent notorious lynching of a negro criminal at Urbana, Ohio, the pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, of that place, preached a sermon in justification of "the punishment of crime by the people," in which he said:—

"Down in the hearts of the people there are times when the justice which is found in the divine law against crime asserts itself, with a power beyond moderation and control,—times when the sense of justice says the criminal ought to die."

Every outbreak of mob violence, then, against a real or supposed criminal, may be regarded as a case of the "justice which is in the divine law" asserting itself, and, of course, "the justice which is in the divine law" is sacred, and its assertion of itself is to be regarded as the movings of a divine force, and a thing not to be forbidden or repressed.

This is a plain justification of such outbreaks of mob violence as that by which this sermon was called out. And when such words are spoken by the professed ambassadors of Christ, the fact may well be regarded as a sign of the times. When those to whom the people look for an exposition of the divine truth that all men ought to receive, justify the work of the lawless passions of human nature, the people are under the leadership of blind guides, who can only lead them into the ditch.

"The justice which is in the divine law" never asserts itself through the agency of a mob.
