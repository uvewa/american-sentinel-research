BY C. H. KESLAKE.

"He that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous." 1 John 3:7.

This does not mean that he that does righteousness thereby becomes righteous, but it does mean that he that does righteousness does so simply because he is already righteous, and the righteousness that he does is the evidence that he is righteous.

It is simply impossible for an unrighteous person to do a righteous act, measured by God's standard of righteousness. Any deed performed is no better in the sight of God than the motive by which it was prompted.

Of motives men cannot safely judge, and an act that may appear to our fellowmen to be righteous, because the motive for such cannot be known, may appear to be entirely the opposite to Him who only can discern the motives.

In order then to do that which is righteous a person must be righteous.

Just here it will be in order to inquire: What is righteousness? There must be some standard of righteousness by which every act, or the motive that prompts the act, may be tested.

The Word of God says that "all unrighteousness is sin," and that "sin is the transgression of the law" (1 John 5:17; 3:4)—not of any law in general, but of some law in particular; for again it is written (Rom. 3:20) "By the law is the knowledge of sin." What this particular law is by which sin is known is told us in Rom. 7:7: "I had not known sin, but by the law; for I had not known lust except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet." But the law that says "Thou shalt not covet," is the law of God—the ten commandments.

As therefore sin is the transgression of that law, and all unrighteousness is sin, it follows that the ten commandments are the standard of righteousness. Every act, and every motive that prompts the act, by whom so ever committed, is either approved or condemned by that law.

To be approved every act must, in the very nature of things, be as good as the law itself. It cannot possibly accept anything that comes, in the least degree, short of it.

It becomes therefore a matter of importance to know what God's law is—what is its nature, its character.

Two scriptures will suffice in deciding this question.

The Apostle Paul says (Rom. 7:12, 14): "The law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good," and "the law is spiritual."

It must therefore be plain that any act that is righteous must be holy, just, good and spiritual. And as "he that doeth righteousness is righteous—does righteousness because he is righteous—it follows that he only can do righteousness who is holy, just, good, and spiritual."

This is a condition that no man is in naturally, and one that he cannot work out for himself. It must be accomplished by a power greater than he himself possesses. It must be wrought for him by God in Christ through the operation of the Holy Spirit. He who has the Holy Spirit dwelling in him will be spiritual, he will love spiritual things, and as the law is spiritual he will love it, and with the Psalmist will exclaim, "Oh, how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day." Ps. 119:97.

Furthermore, he who is filled with the Holy Spirit will have Jesus abiding within him all the time, for the apostle prays that "He [God] would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith." Eph. 3:16, 17.

Christ is our righteousness, for God has made him to be such unto us. 1 Cor. 1:30. Christ dwells in us, not to be a passive spectator of what we do, or try to do, even though we "try to do right," but he is there to himself do—not try to do—that which is righteous. And when he does a thing, no matter what it is, we may be sure that it is altogether righteous; for he cannot deny himself, and in him there is no unrighteousness.

It is therefore only as Christ dwells in the heart, to rule in all our members, that one can do righteousness—that which the law would approve.

What is true of the ten commandments as a whole is true of all its parts. Each commandment of the Decalogue is spiritual, holy, just, and good. The Sabbath, therefore has just this character, and no man can keep it without Jesus Christ abiding within any more than he can keep any other of the commandments. To attempt to enforce the keeping of the Sabbath by human law must therefore be a wicked thing. For it not only makes a person a hypocrite, but it is also a denial of Jesus Christ. It really puts human law—or man, who makes such law—in the place of Christ. The only remedy for the violation of the Sabbath is Christ.

Sabbath-keeping is an act of righteousness. When a man is righteous he will love to do righteousness. He will therefore love to keep the Sabbath. For that kind of a man human law is unnecessary. He is where human law cannot affect him. He is far above it, seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, delighting to do God's will, because the law of the Lord is in his heart.

For an unrighteous person, human law would be inadequate. All it can do is to make a man civil, or punish him for his incivility. In no sense could it make him obey to the slightest degree the law of God.
