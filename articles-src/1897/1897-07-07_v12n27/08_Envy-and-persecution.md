It was because of envy that Cain murdered Abel, and this evil sentiment has been the actuating motive in every case of religious persecution from Cain's time to our own.

The wicked envy the happy estate of the just, which is theirs by virtue of "righteousness, and joy, and peace in the Holy Ghost."
