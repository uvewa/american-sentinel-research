## Freedom for a Million Slaves.

The Christian Endeavorer is much exercised over the matter of "Sunday slavery" which is alleged to be very prevalent in this country. In its March issue it calls for the abolition of this Sunday slavery as the thing of first importance in work for the "rescue of the Sabbath." "There are," it says, "over a million people in the United States who are obliged to work on Sunday against their will."

If the SENTINEL could but reach this million and more of people, it would say to them in the name and by the authority of Him who rules over all, You are not slaves at all, but free men, if you but will to have it so. We have better tidings for you than those who remind you of your slavery. You need not wait for the success of some movement on their part to set you free by law; you are free already. It only remains that you should assert your freedom.

This, of course, you may not be willing to do; but you can do it if you will; and if you do not, your slavery will be voluntary.

You are not compelled to work on Sunday against your will. No one is compelled to do this. You are, at most, only compelled to choose between Sunday work and the prospective suffering of pecuniary loss. But pecuniary loss is not the loss of liberty. The freest individual in the world is liable to pecuniary loss.

If you are in slavery, it is only because you do not know that you are free. That, indeed, is the common condition of mankind. Freedom, full and complete, has been purchased for all. The great emancipation proclamation for the race has been issued, over a name and seal that stand for all power and authority. The only thing necessary for any man is that he shall accept his freedom.

If the slaves of the South had refused to accept the freedom offered them in the proclamation of President Lincoln,—if they had chosen to remain just as they were, refusing to believe that they had been set free, or waiting for some law to be enacted compelling them to be free, they might have remained slaves until this day. In some instances they did, through ignorance, remain in slavery until long after the edict of emancipation went into effect. But the vast majority were willing to take at once the freedom it brought them. They immediately asserted their liberty. But people are very much slower to assert the soul liberty which is just as truly theirs.

By the sacrifice on the cross, the Lord Jesus Christ purchased this liberty for every individual of the race, so that it becomes to each a free gift. But a gift profits not unless it is accepted. By accepting this gift, it becomes the high prerogative of every person to follow always the dictates of his will and conscience.

This, of course demands faith in the word of God. It is faith that sustains the individual in asserting his freedom. His will being always to do that which is right, he simply obeys the dictates of conscience as guided by the Word, and leaves the results with God.

There is no reason whatever why any Christian should complain of "Sunday slavery." The mere fact of such complaint should be conclusive evidence of the non-Christian character of the complainant.

The Christian simply trusts his God and asserts his freedom. Whatever he believes God has commanded, that he does, without reference to any arrangements established by man. Hence he is never without the enjoyment of Sabbath rest. Human customs and regulations must, with him, adapt themselves to the precepts of God, and not the precepts of God to the rules of men.

And this is the liberty that every individual ought to assert. He must assert it, on the basis on which it is offered, if he is to realize it. If he waits for a law to compel him to realize it, he will not realize it at all. Soul liberty cannot be obtained that way.

We say again, there is full and complete liberty for this multitude in "Sunday slavery," for their immediate realization, upon the basis God himself has established for it. God is the Author of liberty and also the Creator of man. He is the God both of the Christian and the gentile. All men should be pointed to that means by which they may know the freedom that God gives, and become forever emancipated from soul-slavery. And why should the Christian Endeavorer point them to anything else?
