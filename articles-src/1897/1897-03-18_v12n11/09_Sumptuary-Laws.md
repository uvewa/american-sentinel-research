## Sumptuary Laws.

### The Union Signal of March 4 makes the following observations on the subject of "Sumptuary Laws:"—

"It seems that sumptuary laws are not so bad after all—when applied to women. We have yet to see a single protest against the enactments of certain municipal councils whereby it is made illegal for women to wear in the theater the 'big hat' of the period. To this we do not object; indeed, we only wish that the law applied to all public assemblies, since it would be much better for the health of the women and far more convenient for those who come to see. We would gladly witness the adoption of a law that women when out walking, should wear no garment that came within three inches of the ground, and we urge it upon our women legislators to introduce such a law in the interest of the public health.

"A speaker recently stated before a Woman's Club in New York that a young lady who had promenaded Fifth Avenue (its most aristocratic street) had kindly submitted the street gleanings of her skirt to a bacteriologist, who captured therefrom seven different kinds of contagious disease microbes. And yet intelligent women insist on dragging their skirts behind them because they think it is more 'stylish.'

"But we cannot help being amused to notice that in this land of 'personal liberty' and 'individual right,' where anything so drastic as a 'sumptuary law' is not to be for a moment tolerated, nobody has raised even a faint little warwhoop in view of the fact that women are now under strict 'sumptuary law' as to their headgear. 'What shall we eat? what shall we drink? and wherewithal shall we be clothed?' may become matters of legislation after all. This is a wonderful age, and we have now established a precedent (a solemn thing to do) for the invasion of the 'liberty of the subject.' After this anything is possible."

Yes; "anything is possible" when legislators once get fairly started in the line of legislation upon the question of what people shall eat or wear. It is of course easy to see in the law against "high hats" in theatres, what is rather facetious than oppressive. There might be nothing very oppressive in a law to compel ladies walking on the streets to wear no garment reaching lower than three inches above the ground. It is quite desirable that street sweeping should be left to those appointed to such work by the city authorities. It is very desirable that people should dress healthfully, eat proper food, and get a proper amount of sleep. Nevertheless we are none of us anxious to be regulated in such matters by legislative fiat. There is a vast step between the condition of being desirable and that of being enforceable at law.

However, it is not unlikely, as suggested, that such questions as "What shall we eat? what shall we drink? and wherewithal shall we be clothed? may become matters of legislation after all." But every act of legislation in this direction, trivial as it may be in itself, undermines a principle that is anything but trivial in its relation to the welfare and happiness of the people. This is the real objection to sumptuary legislation.
