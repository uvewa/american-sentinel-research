## Taxation of Church Property.

By Madison C. Peters, Pastor Bloomingdale Reformed Church, N. Y. City.

The assessed value of New York City church property, exclusive of parsonages, is $51,217,525. Walk up Broadway from Rector Street, and out Fifth and Madison Avenues, and from these streets alone you can see the under-estimated value of church property in New York. The Great estates of Trinity and the Collegiate churches alone are estimated at $50,000,000. Two hundred millions of dollars is something like a conservative estimate of the value of church property of the metropolis, and when we remember that the assessed value of the real estate of the city is less than $2,000,000,000, it can easily be figured out how highly oppressive exemption becomes to other taxpayers. The taxes have to be paid, and the property that is exempt, or rather omitted from the tax roll, is simply spread upon the other property. Everybody's tax goes up at least one-tenth. The American people would rise up in rebellion against direct taxation for church support, but what is exemption from taxation but an indirect State support of the Church, a virtual subsidy for its support, and at the expense of the general public? The State avoids a deficiency in its revenues by transferring to other property increased taxation, not by the voluntary action of the taxpayers, but by the compulsion of law, all of which is out of consonance with our republican institutions. The founders of our Republic wisely separated Church and State. But if we are taxed for the support of churches, it cannot justly be said that the Church and State are separated.

The churches enjoy no immunity from the operations of the laws of God. They place roofs upon their buildings to keep out the rain, and put up lightning rods to prevent the lightning from striking them. If God does not vary his laws for the benefit of the churches, why should the State be expected to do so?

It is argued that many churches are not self-sustaining at present, and that to tax them would render them still less so. Thousands are less able to provide for their children because of the tax collector. Why should the laborer pay taxes upon his humble home and the religious corporation be exempted? Make all property bear its just and equal share of taxation and you lessen the laboring man's burden. When the workingman feels that his burden is heavier because the magnificent possessions of the Church are omitted from the tax roll, do you wonder that the Church loses its power over him? Tax churches and only those able to bear taxes will dare to be extravagant. Tax churches, and modest buildings will be erected where they are most needed instead of a few imposing structures in the fashionable quarter. Every taxpayer in the State has his percentage of State tax correspondingly increased because of the needlessly expensive church properties of the cities,—churches which he may never enter.

The saloon keeper by force of law is compelled to help pay the taxes on my church, in the use of which I denounce his infernal traffic. If the saloon keeper is taxed to support my church, in all fairness he ought to have something to say in its management. "No taxation without representation."

Churches are undoubtedly a public benefit, but if the doctrine of benefits be furnished as a reason for exemption on behalf of religious corporations, it refutes itself by proving more than the State can admit without bankrupting itself, for there are other institutions which are public benefits. It costs the community something to enjoy property, and if the Church paid taxes, it would pay only its honest share to secure its enjoyment of the use of property.

Taxation of church property is to the interest of American principles, and in harmony with the experience of nations. Taxing one man for the propagation of another man's religion is admittedly unjust, and, moreover, it is a relic of the principle of Church and State alliance inherited from the Old World, and not yet eliminated from our political system.
