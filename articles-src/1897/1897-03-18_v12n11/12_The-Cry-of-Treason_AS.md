### The Cry of "Treason."

BY A. SMITH.

When Ahaziah, a certain king of Judah, was slain by Jehu, king of Israel, his mother, Athaliah, daughter of the wicked Ahab and Jezebel, saw her opportunity to usurp the government, which she did by slaying "all the seed royal" except one, the infant son of the king, and reigning instead of the rightful heir.

For six years she held the scepter, but at the end of that time the young prince, Joash by name, was brought forth from the temple, where he had been hidden by his sister, who was the wife of the high priest, and by the principal men of the land was made king and placed upon the throne of Judah amid the acclamations of the people. But when Athaliah saw what had been done she rent her clothes and cried "Treason! Treason!"

Now, who in this instance was guilty of treason, the lawful king or the subverter and usurper of the government? The answer is obvious.

At the present time there is a large class of people in the United States who, in their mistaken zeal to promote religious legislation, are seeking to subvert the Government from the principles upon which it was founded by our forefathers (the most Christlike in principle of any government ever founded by man) and change it into a religious despotism. Those who oppose this innovation are charged with treasonable purposes; and the passions of men, fired by false applications of patriotic principles, are invoked to frenzy against them as subverters of the Government.

There is real danger threatening our political institutions, and it requires a cool unbiased judgment to meet the issue.
