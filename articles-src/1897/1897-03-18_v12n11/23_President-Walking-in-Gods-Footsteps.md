In the opening paragraph of his inaugural address, the President assures the people of the United States that "Almighty God" "will not forsake us so long as we obey His commandments and walk humbly in His footsteps." An exchange points out that inasmuch as Inspiration has testified of the Almighty that "Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known" (Ps. 77:19), the assumption that the people are able to "walk humbly in His footsteps" was a "pretty bad break" on the part of the speaker. That is what usually happens when religion gets into political speeches for political effect.
