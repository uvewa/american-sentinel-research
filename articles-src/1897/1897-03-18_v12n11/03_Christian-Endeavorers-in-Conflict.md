## Christian Endeavorers in Conflict.

The camp of error is never long free from divisions. How this is illustrated by the Christian Endeavorers with reference to Sunday, is pointed out by an exchange, as follows:—

"The Christian Endeavorer, of Chicago, which has entered upon the task of 'rescuing' Sunday from ruin, according to the 'new discovery' of Mr. Gamble, is almost as severe on the popular notion of 'no particular day,' as it is on us for our adherence to a 'particular day.' In the February issue we find the following paragraph:—

"'It is to be hoped that we will hear no more of the foolish statement that there is no divine authority for the observance of Sunday as the Christian sabbath; or the other equally untrue saying: "It makes no difference what day of the week we observe as Sabbath, so that we observe one." Followers of Christ should observe only the first day of the week, the Lord's day, the Christian sabbath.'

"This is a home thrust at the Golden Rule, Dr. Clark's paper, and hitherto the representative paper of Christian Edsavor, which lately declared that the specific day of the Sabbath was of no more importance to Sabbath-keeping than the clothes a preacher wears are to the sermon he preaches. Has it come to this, that Christian Endsavor leaders are so soon divided as to how Sunday shall be saved? These papers have come to such antagonism by inventing different ways of escaping, or trying to escape, from the claims of the Sabbath. God's law is a troublesome thing when men want to invade it; and the greatest of blessings when men are obedient to it."
