The Omaha World-Herald remarks that "amid the political differences that sometimes engender the worst of feeling among men bound together as citizens of a great nation it is well that we should be occasionally reminded that this is a Christian nation." In other words, it is well that we should be occasionally reminded of something which, from all appearances, we should never mistrust to be a fact.
