A press dispatch from Albany, N. Y., dated the 8th inst., states that a State senator and a number of the Assembly have been asked to introduce in the legislature a bill providing for a censorship of the press, the work of the censors being to read all articles intended for publication and "to eliminate all libellous matter and all matters deemed inimical to the interests of the State or any official thereof." This of course would be in plain contradiction to that provision of the Constitution which forbids any congressional interference with the freedom of the press; but it would seem that the would-be reformers of these days know little and care less whether their schemes are in harmony with the National Constitution, or not. There are many straws like this which are showing the direction of the wind.
