The absurdity of the application of the ordinance against "loud noises" in the District of Columbia, made by the would-be guardians of Sunday sanctity against the Sunday newspaper, and sustained recently by Judge Kimball, is set out in the following by the Washington Star:

> "The bells sound clear across the sky
> With warnings deep and grand,
> Policemen loudly tap their clubs
> For order in the land.
> The engine whistle screams above
> The rattle of the train;
> Societies go marching to
> The lusty band's refrain.

> "Then fiercely come the horrid shrieks
> Of cars around the curves;
> And clanging gongs play havoc with
> The most enduring nerves.
> But still we lightly smile and vow
> Peace has not wholly flown,
> For you, O naughty newsboy, are
> As mute as any stone!"
