A great mass meeting was held in Cooper Union, New York City, the evening of the 11th, to favor ratification of the Arbitration treaty between this country and Great Britain. Before the meeting had progressed very far, however, it became evident that about half of those present were not in favor of the treaty. When the resolutions in favor of arbitration were about to be submitted, the comparative quiet of the meeting gave place to pandemonium, in which the "peace" men and the opposing faction became decidedly belligerent. A battle was averted only by the determined efforts of a strong force of police.

It is a curious thing that while public sentiment is so universally against allowing two men to fight with their fists to maintain their "honor," it should at the same time be so largely favorable to war for the purpose of maintaining the "honor" of the nation. Do the awful horrors of war make this method of maintaining "honor" a more desirable one for nations than for individuals? How is this?
