## Enforcing the Decalogue in Kansas.

The following is the bill introduced in the legislature of Kansas, by Representative Walters, calling for the legal enforcement of the Decalogue, as mentioned in our last issue:—

"An Act to give statutory force to the Ten Commandments:

"WHEREAS, The men of the present generation have become doubters and scoffers; and,

"WHEREAS, They have strayed from the religion of their fathers; and,

"WHEREAS, They no longer live in the fear of God; and,

"WHEREAS, Having no fear of punishment beyond the grave, they wantonly violate the law given to the world from Mount Sinai; therefore,

"Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:—

"SECTION 1. Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

"SECTION 2. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image," etc. [Each one of the commandments constitutes a separate section of the Act.]

"SECTION 11. Any man who shall violate any of the provisions of this Act shall be punished as follows:—

"For violating Section 1, $1,000 fine; for violating Section 2, $1,000 fine and one year in the penitentiary; for violating Section 3 or Section 4, $500 fine; for violating Section 5, $500 fine and six months in the penitentiary; for violating Section 6, hanged by the neck until dead; for violating Section 7, penitentiary for life; for violating Section 8, fine or imprisonment, in the discretion of the court; for violating Section 9, imprisonment, in the discretion of the court; for violating Section 10, fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court.

"SECTION 12. This Act shall take effect and be in force from and after its publication in the statute book."

If this proposed measure stood alone as the only thing of the kind which has been brought to public notice, it might be dismissed as a joke. But the facts of the situation justify something more than its mere mention as a piece of "freak" legislation.

This proposed measure only contemplates in part, and on a small scale, what is proposed in the "Christian Amendment" to the Constitution, which has progressed far beyond the possibilities of a joke. That amendment says that "the revealed will of Jesus Christ" shall be "the supreme authority in civil affairs" in every State in the Union. The revealed will of Christ includes the law of ten commandments. The "Christian Amendment" would do for every State what Mr. Walters' measure proposes to do for the State of Kansas.

It is proposed that the Kansas legislature shall enact, "Thou shalt have no other gods before me." As the speaking party in this enactment would be the legislature, the law would be that the legislature must be the god of everybody in the State. And the god who speaks the law having been determined in the first section of the Act, the same god would be meant by the phrase "the Lord thy God" in succeeding sections. Thus by the third section it would become blasphemy to speak lightly of the Kansas legislature, and in the fourth section this assembly would put forth the stupendous claim of having created the heavens and the earth!

Absurd as such claims would be, they are no more than what is really involved in every instance of religious legislation. For religion being the performance of those duties which an individual owes to his God, only God can rightfully command such duties; and when such duties are commanded by any party, that party by that very act assumes to be God. Every law upon the statute books of the States which enjoins the observance of the "Lord's day," involves nothing less than the claim that the law-making party is God.

Yet these "sabbath" laws are to be found upon the statute books of almost every State, and they are not generally regarded as examples of "freak" legislation. Neither, as stated, is the proposed "Christian Amendment" so regarded by the vast majority of those composing the churches and religious societies. And so strong is the support which these give to it, and so potent has their influence upon Congress been shown to be, that the "Christian lobbyists" who have charge of it at the seat of government are actually hopeful that the National Assembly will take favorable action upon it during their next session.

It should be observed also that by Mr. Walters' bill the seventh day of the week will be made the legal sabbath in the State of Kansas. For the fourth commandment plainly says "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work;" and any almanac affords proof that the day "commonly called Sunday" is the first day of the week and not the seventh. The Sunday law itself commonly specifies that Sunday is the "first day of the week." "The seventh day" and "the first day" of that division of time which the Sabbath marks, cannot be one and the same day.

"The seventh day" must mean the day before Sunday, which is commonly called Saturday.

Another point that must not be overlooked is raised by the query as to what will constitute a violation of this Act. Jesus Christ said that hatred in the heart was a violation of the commandment which says, "Thou shalt not kill," which is Section 6 in Mr. Walters' bill. See Matt. 5:21, 22. No doubt it will be acknowledged that there is no higher authority upon the subject than this. The courts will therefore be obliged to take cognizance of hatred as a violation of Section 6 of this State law, of lust as a violation of Section 7, etc., and inflict the penalties specified in the Act. The enlargement of the State prisons and penitentiaries which the punishment of such persons, together with all who were covetous, would demand, it would be needless to try to specify. The penal institutions would simply have to be made large enough to take in the entire population of the State.

If we are really to have a "Christian Amendment" to the Constitution which will make "the revealed will of Jesus Christ" the "supreme authority in civil affairs" for all the nation, it may be well that the experiment should be first tried on the small scale which Mr. Walters' bill proposes, in order that the people may judge of its utility for the wider field of national government. It would certainly be far preferable that the Kansas legislature should pass this bill, rather than that the National Legislature should pass the so-called Christian Amendment.
