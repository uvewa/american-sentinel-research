## A New Sunday Bill at Albany.

"New York World," March 9.

When Senator Wilcox at Albany declares, as he does in his proposed amendment to the Penal Code, that it shall be an indictable offense to play "the game commonly known as baseball" on Sunday, we know what he means. But when he also prohibits "all shooting, hunting, fishing, playing, horse-racing, gaming, or other public sport, exercise or shows," the average mind finds it hard to follow him.

Is all "playing" on Sunday to be made a crime by law? Is fishing on Sunday to be prohibited? Is riding a bicycle a "public sport, exercise or show?" If Senator Wilcox does not mean what he says, what does he mean? If he means what he says, we might profitably swap legislation with Kansas, where they only propose to enact the Ten Commandments into statutes.
