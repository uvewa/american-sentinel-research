"Lord's Day Congress" in Lowell, Mass.

BY F. C. GILBERT.

---

The New England Sunday Protective League held another of its congresses on March 4, in Lowell, Mass., for the purpose of agitating the enforcement of Sunday sacredness by law. It seemed evident that the afternoon audience were not wholly inspired with the spirit of the movement, which caused the leaders some displeasure. The real spirit was, however, in no wise lacking among the prime movers.

Rev. O. H. Denney, who conducted the devotional exercises, read from the thirteenth chapter of Nehemiah, and thought the lesson was very applicable to present conditions. The same principles inculcated by that man of God should be instilled in the minds of the people at the present time. The same power which Nehemiah used to compel the men of Tyre to desist from "selling fish on Sunday," should be swayed by the leaders of religionists to-day, he said. And in the course of his growing eloquence he asked, "Nehemiah had authority to compel those people to refrain from selling fish on Sunday. What will God say when asking us [meaning the preachers] if we used our infallible authority in the same way, and we reply we did not"? "We should as ministers of the gospel compel these people to desist from selling their modern fish on Sunday, such as Sunday papers, cigars, soda-water," etc.

We had always thought that there is only one person in this world who claimed infallible authority, but it appears that the popes are legion. Where in the Bible do the preachers find that God endowed them with "infallible authority" to seek power from legislatures to enforce their ideas of Sunday sacredness upon the whole people? Where has the Lord authorized them to lay their hands upon the people to make them desist from selling their wares on Sunday? I suppose the chapter on "infallible authority" must be in the same volume which records that Nehemiah told the people to desist from selling fish on Sunday, and which says that the first day of the week is the Sabbath.

In the address of welcome, Rev. F. K. Stratton confessed that the ministers of the city were apathetic to this phase of the Sabbath (Sunday) question, and hoped there would be a reformation hereafter,—that the ministry would often tell the people they ought to have Sunday laws, and why. He too administered scathing rebukes to the various kinds of modern "fish" sold on Sunday, and protested against their breaking down the modern Sunday. Hence he accorded the Congress a hearty welcome, believing it to be very timely, and hoped it would be the beginning of a successful crusade against all the evils of desecration, etc., etc.

The next speaker, Rev. S. T. Ford, in response to the welcome for the city churches, was not as harmonious on the issue as his predecessors. In fact he was quite "heterodoxical," as he expressed it, and his speech confirmed the statement. He believed in the entire separation of Church and State, and that no legislation should be secured for the sacredness of the day. He said that man could not be made religious by law, and all laws which sought to enforce religion were contrary to the doctrine of Americanism. There is but one way a man becomes devotional, and that is by having his conscience awakened by the Spirit of God. And he remarked that all laws designed to enforce religious dogmas were simply avenues toward uniting Church and State. He thought that the only ground upon which these Sunday laws could be secured was the economic phase,—that people had a right to have one day's rest in seven from labor as a matter of physical necessity. It was apparent his speech did not have a soothing effect upon the ministers generally, but it certainly was a relish to hear one man, in such an assembly, express some vital truths on the subject of religious liberty.

A paper on "the authority of the Lord's day" was read by Rev. S. M. Dick; but that the Lord designed a definite, specific, twenty-four hour period, was regarded as foolishness by the speaker. He said it simply meant that the Lord designed that man should rest on a given day; and when the community or the State or country declared which day it should be, then, remarked the speaker, that is the day that the Lord blessed. Of course as long as the people had decided in this nation that the first day of the week was the day, everybody ought to keep that day, for the Bible was authority for the sanctity of the day. We were reminded of what the Apostle Peter said relative to people wresting the Scripture to their own destruction. How sad to hear people, especially those claiming to be in a special manner the representatives of Jesus Christ, distort his sacred word, and make it contradict itself, thus making God a liar.

He cited several instances where fearful damage was done because the day was not observed, and he remarked that the very steam engines wore as much on that day as they did on all the other days of the week combined! Great is the Sunday of America!

Mr. Kneeland, Secretary of the League, took charge of the question box, and gave a statement of the workings of the society. Among the questions asked, one was, "What is the object of Sunday laws?" The reply was, "The object of Sunday laws is to preserve the State." Thus the people are being educated to believe that unless Sunday laws are secured, and the sacredness of the day enforced by these State laws, this Government cannot be preserved. Several other questions were asked and answered, the tendency of nearly all being to annul the idea of seventh-day observance, to set forth the importance of first-day observance, and the necessity of its observance by legal statute.

In outlining the work of the League, to secure a rest day for everybody, he spoke of the acceptance of the presidency of the League by United States Senator Hoar, of Massachusetts, and his belief relative to Sunday: "I believe thoroughly in a day of rest, which shall be largely devoted to the contemplation of divine themes and to the worship of God and teaching his law; and in protecting this observance against disturbances by secular labor, or other discords, by law." It is on this line that the League is working,—that the State should make laws compelling people to refrain from labor in order that they might be religious on that day. Or as Dr. Kneeland said: "We must have laws to protect the sacredness of Sunday." He urged the people to give their names which he might present to the various governmental functionaries when necessary, in order that the League may secure power to carry out its end. He spoke of their success thus far, and said they had not lost a case or been refused a thing by either the courts or commissioners, or legislatures, and had no doubt whatever of their ultimate success. He mentioned the fact that there were four bills at the present time pending in the Massachusetts legislature, all of which were presented through the direct or indirect influence of the League. There were bills being presented in other legislatures of New England favorable to their work, and he hoped they would be passed. He told the people of Lowell if they had any influence with their representatives in the legislature, to bring it to bear upon these men to pass these bills; and, said he, "if they refuse, just put them out of the way next time, and give them a back seat."

Thus it is evident what these people are after; and when they secure this power, woe to such as refuse to obey their mandates. The signs on the religio political horizon are ominous; the clouds are even now gathering thick and fast. Let every lover of liberty awake, and gird on the armor to stand through this rapidly-approaching conflict.
