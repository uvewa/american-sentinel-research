It seems that the bill of Mr. Walters of Kansas, to give the Decalogue legal force in that State, was introduced in all seriousness, according to *The Examiner*, of this city. "The bill," says this journal, "has already passed to its third reading, and as we go to press Mr. Walters announces his intention of forcing a final vote during the present week. He says that he is meeting with the greatest encouragement from the citizens of his State, and even were he so inclined, he would not now dare to retreat.
