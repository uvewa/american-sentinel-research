It seems to be a difficult matter—if not an impossibility—to secure the retracement of a single step which the Government has taken in the direction of union with the Church. An illustration of this is furnished in the action of the Senate Committee to whose lot it fell to report on the Indian appropriation bill sent up from the House. Instead of submitting it without any appropriations for sectarian Indian schools, as was provided for by Congress last year, it was reported to the Senate with a provision that during the coming year such schools shall have the same Government aid as this year, less ten per cent. The provision of Congress in the matter was that after June 30, 1897, all such appropriations should cease; and that during the year ending with that date, the appropriation should be only half that of the year previous. "It strikes us," says the Independent, "that the best way to cease is to cease." But the trouble is that Congress, as represented by this committee, is not seeking the best way to cease.
