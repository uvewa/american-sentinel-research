THE activity of Christian Endeavor organizations all over the land in the work of securing Sunday enforcement, is indicated by a plan of work outlined in the *Golden Rule*, of March 4, to be followed by each local society in all the States. This plan is based upon a system of credits to be allowed for proficiency in organization for "Sabbath reform" work, and especially for achievements in securing cessation of Sunday work. The credits range from one, to be allowed for each "Lord's Day Committee" organized by a local society, to two hundred for initiating "a movement that shall by persuasion or law cause the discontinuance of any Sunday paper," and three hundred for securing "the discontinuance of Sunday trains on any railroad." The society securing the largest number of these credits will be presented with a "Lord's Day banner" at the coming international convention in San Francisco next July.
