The following truthful words concerning the Sabbath were uttered by one of the speakers at the late Christian Endeavor convention at San Francisco:—

"The land is full of very queer notions regarding the Sabbath, and many Christians have a vague understanding of it. They regard the Sabbath as a Jewish institution just as the Egyptians regarded the Nile as an Egyptian river, never thinking that the river was running hundreds of miles before it ever came to Egypt; and so it is with the Sabbath. It was in existence before the first king was born, before Abraham was born,—it had existed all along. It passed through Jewish institutions . . . but it is not at all Jewish. Our Lord himself said that the Sabbath was made for man,—not for the Jew, not for the American, but for man wherever found."
