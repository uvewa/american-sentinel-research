A French journal is quoted as saying that it was the Americans who did most to make the Queen's Jubilee a success. This is doubtless an exaggerated statement, but it shows how the American craze for that which pertains to royalty is becoming conspicuous in the eyes of the nations.

And now comes the statement from Kansas, made in all seriousness, that the feature of the "fall festivities" in that section is to be a "queen," who will be none other than Mrs. Mary Lease, the Populist orator. At least, such is the program of the committee in charge of the festivities, and they have telegraphed for her acceptance of the "honor."

The queen will wear a $20,000 crown—a sufficient proof of the genuineness of her royalty—and will reign one week. This will be a short reign, to be sure, but it is as long as the reigns of some of the monarchs who have figured in history.

In case Mrs. Lease should decline to be a queen, it is hardly to be doubted that no very long search will be required to find some other head that will be willing, for the sake of the honors of royalty, to carry a $20,000 crown for a week.
