Diabolus.—One of the greatest foes to our cause, next to the power of Christianity, is honest industry. It keeps the minds and hands of the people busy with other things than those we would have them engaged in.

Beelzebub.—That is true; but I have a plan in mind which will remedy that.

D.—Ha! what is it?

B.—Why; I will have a Sunday law passed, making honest industry a crime one day in each week, and innocent recreation as well. That will fix things just as we want them. The Christians, of course, will not be affected —they will spend the day in worship the same as before; but they are only a few. All the rest will then be where we can have full swing at them, and our job will be dead easy. We know well enough that minds and hands must have employment of some kind, and the Sunday law will give us a monopoly of furnishing the same to every one who does not care for Christianity. How is that?

D.—Good! We'll attend the reform ministers' meeting this evening, and have a committee of them sent to work the legislature right away.
