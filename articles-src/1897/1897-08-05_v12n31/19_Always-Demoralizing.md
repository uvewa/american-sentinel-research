Enforced leisure is always demoralizing, for when hands are idle under such circumstances, his Satanic majesty is busy finding some mischief for them to do. No enforced Sunday rest applies to him. The report of the "New York Sabbath Committee" for 1894–1896 says:—

"The general suspension of business is seized upon for illegal traffic. Large numbers of people are employed in supplying demoralizing amusements and the means of dissipation on the day of leisure, and are constantly on the watch to change the laws which stand in their way, and to stir up prejudice against them."

Of course; what other result could be expected?
