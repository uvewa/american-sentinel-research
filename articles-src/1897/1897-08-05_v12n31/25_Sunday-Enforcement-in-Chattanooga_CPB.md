Chattanooga has "turned over a new leaf" in the matter of Sunday observance, and is likely erelong to turn over another. The so-called reform was on this wise:

A new head was recently selected for the Police Board, and immediately orders were issued to close all saloons on Sunday, in harmony with the city ordinance to that effect. The saloon men—

"Grumbled and said 'twas no use;
'Twas horrid injustice and horrid abuse.'"

The authorities were however firm, and the saloons closed as per their order. But in all other respects the city pursued the even tenor of its way. Groceries, fruit stands, confectionaries, news stands, soda fountains, ice-cream saloons, livery stables, street-car companies, etc., continue to do business as before, and each week the saloon men grow more desperate. They demand that the law shall be enforced impartially upon all, if enforced at all, and threaten to stop even the running of the street cars unless the order closing the saloons shall be revoked.

The Police Board has replied that so far as the city is concerned there is no discrimination. The city ordinance prohibits only Sunday liquor selling and Sunday barbering and either says nothing about other lines of business or else permits them; and that while it is true that the law of the State prohibits all business alike, it is no more their place to enforce the State law than it is the business of the saloon-keepers; and that if they (the saloon-keepers) wish the law enforced it is their privilege to swear out warrants against all violators of the statute. This the saloon men threaten to do. The matter may also be brought before the grand jury, though that seems unlikely.
