As the tiny forest leaf indicates the direction of the gentle summer breeze when greater objects do not yield to its influence, so the trifling deeds of man first betray the tendency of his course. In his great efforts he is guarded. In the less important acts, the motives which prompt thereto are most clearly revealed.

In a little incident of recent occurrence, this principle served to illustrate the animus of that class of religionists who become so zealous for the formal observance of supposed religious duties that they welcome civil enactments to force them upon their fellows. The facts involved are these:—

Connecticut has remodeled her Sunday law. Conformity to the "reform" ideal was sought and partially realized. The provisions and penalties of the new law have been noticed in these columns. In a quiet rural district of this State resides an aged Christian who consistently observes the seventh day as the Sabbath, in harmony with the fourth section of God's great law. On the other six days he quietly follows his agricultural pursuits.

This devoted Christian recently received from an anonymous friend a letter enclosing a newspaper clipping quoting the revised Sunday statute. On the margin was written in ink, "A word to the wise SHOULD be sufficient." (Emphasis his own.)

This warning is but a new rendering of the old adage, "A word to the wise is sufficient." Why did the writer revise this saying, the truthfulness of which is beyond dispute? Why did he insert for the positive assertion the doubtful subjunctive? Plainly because his faith in the wisdom of the person addressed exceeded his confidence in the application of the adage quoted. In other words, this person knew that wisdom had no condemnation for Sunday work. Had he believed that the possession of wisdom would lead to abstinence from labor on Sunday, he would have made his neighbor's future course subject to his wisdom or folly. But as the sentence was written, it clearly revealed the fact that the would-be monitor regarded the wisdom of the subject of his counsel as above impeachment. Furthermore, it degraded the author's warning from the plane of admonition and friendly caution to the lower level of bluffs and intimidations.

This man's evident conception of the relation of wisdom and Sunday labor is amply sustained by the Scriptures. "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments." To be wise, then, is to fear the Lord. To "do his commandments" is to give evidence of "a good understanding" possessed. Therefore, since "his commandments" declare "six days shall thou labor, . . . but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God," and "in it thou shalt not do any work," how could this servant of God manifest wisdom in yielding to his neighbor's threat?

With the apostles he may say, "We ought to obey God rather than men." God has spoken, and "a word to the wise is sufficient." Therefore he still works.
