Those ministers who are looking to legislation as the great and sure panacea for all the ills that afflict the nation, often express the idea that suitable legislation well enforced will make it much easier for people to do right, and much harder for them to do wrong.

In the sentiment expressed in these words, we may see a wide departure from the gospel idea of reform. The minister of Christ is looking to something beside Christ as a means of accomplishing what the power of Christ is set forth in the Scriptures as accomplishing alone. It is not questioned that civil law does deter men from committing crime, and that such laws are a necessity in the present condition of the world; but when a minister of the gospel comes to depend on civil law as the best known force for reformation, he actually admits that he knows of nothing better.

The object of the civil law is to prevent men from doing things which they want to do, but which are a damage to society as a whole. This is as far as the power of man can go. To the thief it says, Steal, and I will put you in prison; to the murderer, Kill, and you shall hang for it. The natures of these would-be criminals are not changed by the law; and let them once feel sure that they will escape detection and the law will not deter them from the commission of crime.

But the work of the gospel is far different, far better than this. Its object is so to change a man's natural evil disposition that he will love right and truth, and would practice them even if the law were against those things. The power by which this can be done is the power of God, and that power is in the gospel. By it, the very heart of man is changed, and the whole being in all its purposes is renewed and made like Christ. Civil law can only take cognizance of the outward conduct; it cannot touch the heart. Civil law strains as well as it can the foul stream of depraved humanity; the gospel cleanses the source of the stream and makes it all pure. The civil law is content if a man does good according to its standard; the gospel makes a man good himself. The real goodness that arises from a changed heart cannot be legislated into being. Says Lacratelle, "Les vertus neés de la religion, se cachent dans la religion meme." (The virtues born of religion, are hidden in religion itself.) They cannot be found outside of it.

So when a minister of the gospel turns to the civil law as the chief means to promote virtue, he has certainly mistaken his calling. An intelligent physician would recommend the best remedy he knew for a disease, and should not a minister of the gospel recommend the best he knows to cure the evil in the hearts of men? And if he recommends the civil law, what is that but saying that he knows nothing better?

It is a fact that a great many of the clergy have determined upon the renovation of the world by means of the civil law. The broad way is to be hedged full of legal enactments, making progress there extremely difficult; and the narrow way is to be, by municipal regulation, widened into a boulevard and made attractive and easy to walk in. It seems almost a wonder, since men conceive there is such a power in law, that some one of these ministers does not propose an injunction in order to shut up the broad way altogether, so that none can ever walk in it again!

Sad indeed is it that those who have been called to preach the gospel should value it so little; that those who have the promise of the power of God to reform men, should cast it aside as though it were of no particular account, and take in its place the power of human laws. The snows of Lebanon are exchanged for the muddy waters of Babylon, the cloven tongues of fire for the policeman's club; cringing fear is to take the place of intelligent faith, dread of earthly penalty that of loving service to a kind heavenly Father. So the divine Master is wounded in the house of his professed friends, and the gospel way of reformation thus cast aside by the ministry as though it were not as efficacious as man's way, is brought into discredit.

In their efforts to make the way of reform easy, they let go of the power that alone can change the heart, to take the power that can only affect the outward conduct. Such a reform from a Bible standpoint, and that should be the minister's standpoint, is valueless; it never can accomplish any lasting, any real good.
