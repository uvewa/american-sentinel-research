"In 1894," says the report of the "New York Sabbath Committee," "out of a total of 98,296 arrests by the police, 582 were for violations of the Sunday statutes, exclusive of excise cases. In 1895, out of 112,997 arrests, 1,415 were for similar violations. This increase of arrests was due to the greater efficiency with which all laws began then to be enforced, and in the case of the Sunday arrests, to the efforts to suppress illegal Sunday traffic in stores and by pedlars, on complaint of dealers and employees for the protection of their own right to the Sunday rest. For the first half of 1896, there were 431 arrests for Sunday violations, out of a total of 53,322."

Thus in the period of time which this report covers there were 2,428 arrests which were entirely needless, and the trouble and expense of which—to say nothing of the injury to the victims—might have been avoided but for the idea, handed down from the Dark Ages, that religious institutions ought to have the "protection" of the civil law.
