As many readers of the SENTINEL are taking advantage of our special offer to send the paper to their friends, we would suggest that it would be well to notify such friends that the paper has been ordered to their address, so that they may not refuse to take it, thinking it had been sent them without being ordered, and later they would be asked to pay for it.
