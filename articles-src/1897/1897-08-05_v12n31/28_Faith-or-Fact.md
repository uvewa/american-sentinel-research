This is the title of a book of 331 pages, which comes to us for review from the firm of Peter Eckler, of this city. The author is Mr. Henry M. Taber, and his endeavor is to show that faith and fact are antagonistic to each other. To this end he cites a numerous array of facts bearing upon quite a wide range of topics, which seem designed to include every prominent manifestation of human thought and action to which religion has given rise.

The purpose of the author does not appear to have demanded any great effort at substantiating his "facts" by proof. For example, on page 99, he states that "Three Baptists (who religiously observe the seventh day of the week) have been for months languishing in a prison in Tennessee for the crime(!) of attending to their gardens or performing some ordinary farm duties on Sunday." But no Baptists were ever imprisoned in Tennessee for Sunday labor. Mr. Taber might easily have learned the truth on this point if he had been anxious to state the matter correctly.

As a presentation of the superstition, credulity, hypocrisy, errors, inconsistencies, follies, fanaticism, injustice, and crimes of which men have been guilty in the name of Christianity, Mr. Taber's book would be well worth perusing, provided it were a profitable occupation to peruse such records,—which it is not.

As regards its intended impeachment of faith, it is sufficient to say of Mr. Taber's book that it is based upon a false assumption and is therefore a failure from the start, as every work of the kind must be. It assumes that Christianity is responsible for all the crime and folly that have been perpetrated in her name. As well might it be assumed that Liberty is responsible for all the crimes that have been committed in her name. "Freethinkers" believe in liberty, while condemning lawlessness and anarchy. Why can they not be as fair towards Christianity?

Christianity is no more responsible for the frauds which have used her fair name to mask their baseness, than is the United States mint responsible for the counterfeit coins which rogues have put into circulation. The very fact that there have been and are spurious Christians, is proof of the value of genuine Christianity.

A United States coin is counterfeited because, for the rogue's purpose, it is worth counterfeiting. For the same reason there are counterfeit Christians. But who ever heard of a counterfeit "Freethinker"?

Faith is not superstition; it is not credulity. It is the assent of the mind and heart to the Word of God, as a revelation of truths which lie beyond the range of finite vision. It is a means of knowing all-important facts which could not otherwise be ascertained.
