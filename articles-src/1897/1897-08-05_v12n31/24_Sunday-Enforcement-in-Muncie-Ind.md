A PRESS telegram from Muncie, Ind., under date of July 18, gives the following with reference to the new crusade for Sunday enforcement in that place:

"Muncie has not experienced such exciting times on Sunday for many years as to day, when the steps were taken to close every business house in the city in strict accordance with an old law. The Young Men's Christian band issued a manifesto last week notifying all who engaged in their regular vocation on Sunday that affidavits for their arrest would be filed by the members of the band. For three days the threat has been the chief topic of conversation, and it was supposed that the city would be closed up as tight as a clam to-day, and that possibly the street cars would not venture out. On the contrary, all the meat shops with a single exception, cigar stores, drug stores, ice cream parlors, and delivery wagons, bakeries, candy stores, bicycle stores, soda fountains and some groceries did business as usual, and the usual regard was paid to the saloon law. The street cars not only ran, but the company carried out its programme at West Side Park with a band concert, balloon ascension, and baseball game, unmolested by the sheriff.

"The churches were largely attended. At High Street M. E. Church, Rev. Mr. Naftzger, the pastor, was not present, but the discussion of the threat was so warm pro and con that it was decided to take a vote as to how the members of the church stood on the Blue Law enforcement, and when those favoring the action were asked to stand, the number was, it is said, very small, and there was loud hand clapping from those who refused to arise. In the church, W. A. Thompson, one of the leading lawyers in the State, denounced the stringent action proposed, while strong arguments were heard on the other side. During the day members of the "band" were collecting evidence for affidavits to cause arrests Monday."
