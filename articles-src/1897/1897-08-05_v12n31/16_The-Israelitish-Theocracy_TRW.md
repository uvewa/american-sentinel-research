"Now all these things happened unto them for en-samples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come." 1 Cor. 10:11.

National Reformers and those who in these times favor the enforcement of Sunday laws point us back to the Scripture history of ancient Israel as authority for the setting up of an earthly theocracy. They say that as God approved the action of the government then when the worship of God was enforced by law, therefore God would approve now if the keeping of Sunday were enforced in like manner by earthly governments.

Now if we examine the record we shall find that after the entering of the land of Canaan by Israel, the period during which a purely heaven-made theocracy endured did not outlast the time of the judges, and during the rule of the judges the nation did not serve God through any fear of their earthly rulers, as the judge kept no court, had no army immediately at his call, was not surrounded by warriors who hastened to inflict punishment at his command, and though the judge, as in the case of Deborah, might command and lead an army, yet the people furnished that army or they refused to furnish it as best pleased them. Part of the people did not respond to the call of Deborah and Barak, and Deborah and Barak visited no punishment upon the disobedient ones. They denounced the punishment of God upon them and then left them entirely to him, and God punished them as he saw fit. That was the time of a pure theocracy, a true government of God directly over the people.

It was so in the wilderness too, the people were punished by God direct, in most cases, for disobedience to divine commands, and Moses was the direct mouthpiece of God.

Under the judges, there was no support by the people of an expensive retinue of princes and nobles in the form of a governing body surrounding the ruler, who directed all movements and who controlled all interests of State or church or family.

The government was exceedingly mild and people feared God, if they feared him at all, because he himself dealt directly with the nation.

God named and selected each succeeding judge, whether that judge were Eli, or Samuel, or Samson, or Gideon. When the people chose for themselves, as in the case of Abimelech, they generally chose badly and they then suffered for it, and in that choice they forsook the theocracy; for a true theocracy is never anything but the direct government of God without the intervention of any but inspired rulers chosen by the Deity himself.

This state of things did not continue. Israel desired a king, and God through Samuel directed that they be provided with one. They wished to be "like all the nations" (1 Sam. 8:20); and God in anger, not in gentleness, not in approval, granted their request. Hos. 13: 9-11. And though the theocracy still remained, yet from that time it had a human mixture in it; it was the rule of God, through a king backed by the power of an army, and the king, working his own human will by means of an armed force, became to the people a god, not merely the instrument of Jehovah, but a veritable deity, served and obeyed more abjectly and servilely than God ever required any one to serve a human being. The king was god. The government was the divinity of the nation.

When the king served the Lord the people did so too, because the king commanded them to do so, and when the king became an idolater the people blindly followed their ruler because they were commanded or led by him in that direction; and if it be true, as Paul says, that "To whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey" (Rom. 6:16), then the people of Israel under the kings were for the most part servants of the reigning monarch and not servants of God. When they served God, they served him because the government bade them do so and for fear of the penalties which might be brought upon them by command of the government, and that was not genuine service of God, but service of the government; and when the government served idols the people just as readily followed the government, and so the government was to them a deity.

Twenty-one kings reigned in Jerusalem before the captivity, and twelve of them followed evil courses, and in nearly every instance the people followed the evil-minded monarch in his evil course.

After the captivity, if we accept the record as written in Maccabees and Josephus and the New Testament, we find the same state of affairs. The people were inclined to follow the government. When Ezra or Nehemiah or Zerubbabel or Judas Maccabes commanded the service of God, the people served the Lord; and when murderous Herod commanded the slaughter of innocent babes, or Annas or Caiaphas commanded direct emnity to the Son of God, the people obeyed and the rulers worked their own tyrannical wills. This is the record of theocracy as administered by human government backed up by armed force, and it is a record that shows to us in this age of progress that we had better have as clear a separation between Church and State, or religion and the State, as is possible.

The union of the two can result only in evil, for mankind can hope to furnish no greater proportion of righteous rulers now out of a given line or number than could be produced in olden Israel with their continuous line of inspired prophets and priests.

Paul warned the Christians of his day that evil men should spring up among them, not sparing the flock.

Acts 20:29,30. Scarcely an epistle has been given us from apostolic pens that does not chronicle the tendencies of Christians to depart from the truth, or the efforts of professed Christians to rule the church in their own sinful way. James calls the members of the church adulterers and adulteresses (James 4:1-5); and Jesus, in the messages to the seven churches (Rev. 2 and 3), brings charges against five churches of them, and serious charges, too, they are; and if the Bible itself tells us of failure on the part of God's people to serve him when the government was in their hands, of repeated and wicked departures from him, and even in the Christian age shows us that the Lord's people have the very same ancient tendency to depart from him—that in short, professed Christians are no fitter to trust with absolute control of State or nation than were the Israelites when God committed just such a trust to them; that his people are just as likely to stray and wander and rebel now as they ever were, we may see also that religion and the State would better occupy entirely separate spheres. Still further, we see that mixing religion and the State in European countries, mingling civil and religious affairs, has not made the governments of those countries or their people Christian, but has had a tendency to make the people formalists, and therefore hypocrites; for formalism and hypocrisy are in religion synonymous terms.

Were it possible to enforce a Sunday or Sabbath law so perfectly that every living soul would be compelled to conform to the law, it would yet remain a fact that mankind generally, in obeying the law, would, like ancient Israel, obey not from fear of God but from fear of the government, and they would therefore serve the government as a god, and would be government worshipers and not Jehovah worshipers. But to worship anything instead of Jehovah, even to worship a government instead of Jehovah, is idolatry, and cannot be acceptable to God, for "they that worship the Father must worship him in spirit and in truth." "The Father seeketh such [and only such] to worship him." John 4:23,24. This kind of worship no government but a true theocracy, without the intervention of any earthly armed force, can ever bring about or procure.

"And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me. And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?" Luke 12:13,14. "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's." Matt. 22:21. "If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not." "The word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him at the last day." John 12:47,48. "My kingdom is not of this world." John 18:36.

If Christ, as declared in these Scriptures, utterly disclaims kingly rule or the right to judge before the last day, where and how can his professed followers acquire such power in his name? It is certain that as the theocracy that was set up long ago failed to make men serve God in spirit and in truth, and as Christ claimed no kingly power over unbelievers before the last day and threatened the enforcement of no judgments upon them until that time, there can remain no right in his followers now to set up a civil government in his name or to control in his name any government that is already set up.

God made no mistake in establishing the Israelitish theocracy, just as he made no mistake in creating the world; but man has marred and mangled every heavenly gift that God has committed to his control, whether it be the earth, or the Sabbath, or marriage, or organized government; and it is better in the matter of a theocracy to await God's own good time. Let the Father in the times and seasons which he has put in his own power bring his king, the Lord Jesus Christ, to the world and establish the King of glory upon the throne of universal and everlasting dominion.

That will be the only theocracy worth our consideration and our contemplation.
