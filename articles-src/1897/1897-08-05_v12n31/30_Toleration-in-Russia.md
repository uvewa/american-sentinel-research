The Berlin correspondent of the London Standard telegraphs that while celebrating Christmas eve in the German manner the Czarina was asked by her husband to express a wish. She whispered:

"Please permit a little more religious toleration."

The Czar answered, smilingly: "That will come by and by."

The Czar has remembered his promise, and has recently issued a ukase cancelling that of his father, which ordered that every non-orthodox person in Russia who married an orthodox person should sign a document declaring that he would baptize and educate his children in the orthodox faith. The ukase of Emperor Nicholas permits children of mixed marriages to be educated in the religion of their parents—sons in that of their father's and daughters in that of their mother's.
