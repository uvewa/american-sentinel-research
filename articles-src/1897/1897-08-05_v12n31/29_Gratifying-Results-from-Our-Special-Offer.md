Nothing could give the publishers of the AMERICAN SENTINEL more genuine satisfaction than the remarkable manner in which its friends have responded to our "special offer," the announcement of which appeared first in our issue of the 22nd ult. A week, at least, should elapse before returns could in reason be hoped for, yet as we close the forms of this week's paper, we are gratified to state that over one thousand new subscribers under the offer have been received, and these only from less than one half the States where the SENTINEL circulates. Over fifty have sent in clubs of from five to twenty subscriptions each; long lists have come through the State tract societies and individual subscriptions are numbered by the scores. This is something quite remarkable in newspaper circulation, and especially at this time of year. It demonstrates beyond a question of doubt that the SENTINEL has a very warm place in the hearts of its constituency, for it is the love of the principles for which the paper stands in defense, and the desire that they shall be known among all men, that have led to this unselfish activity in its behalf.

We are profoundly grateful for this evidence of appreciation, and it stimulates us, as nothing else could, to redouble our efforts in giving the SENTINEL's message in no uncertain tone. So let us together, editors and readers, unite hand in hand in "pressing the battle to the gates," so that all the people in all the land may know, and know in the light of God's word, what the dangers are that threaten us, and the way of escape.
