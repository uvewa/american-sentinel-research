The report of the "New York Sabbath Committee" for 1894–1896, gives the following summary of recent changes in the Sunday laws of the various States:—

"Vermont, in the revised Sunday law of 1894, omits the old-time prohibition of traveling and visiting, except for necessity or charity, and of being present at any public assembly except for worship and instruction.

"In Rhode Island, the General Law of 1896 provides for the exemption of those who keep another day than Sunday as the Sabbath.

"In New Jersey, by the Amendatory Act of April 28, 1893, it is made 'not unlawful' to publish or sell newspapers, to sell milk, to ride or hire horses and carriages for recreation on Sunday; subject to the power of the local authorities to regulate or prohibit by ordinances the acts thus made lawful, in their several municipalities.

"In Georgia, a law passed in 1895 permits the running on Sunday of special fruit and vegetable trains, under careful restrictions.

"Public ball games and other sports on Sunday, forbidden in most of the States by the general statutes, have become in some places so serious an evil by reason of the large and noisy crowds assembled and the temptation to mischief, that special ordinances have been found necessary to suppress them.

"The work of barbers, which in some States has been held to come under the general prohibition of labor on Sunday, has been forbidden by special statutes, on demand of the barbers themselves, in Missouri, Ohio, Kentucky, Illinois, Colorado and Montana, as well as in New York as mentioned above.

"California, which had been for a number of years without any Sunday law—except that, as in the other States, by the common law Sunday is a holiday, dies non juridicus—in 1895 passed 'An Act to provide a day of rest from labor;' it declares that 'every person employed in any occupation of labor is entitled to one day's rest therefrom in seven,' and makes it unlawful for an employer of labor to cause an employé to work more than six days in seven, except in cases of emergency. The position of California in this respect is unique, no such law being found in any other State. An unsuccessful attempt in 1895 to enact a suitable Sunday law has aroused public sentiment, and led to renewed efforts for reform.

"Oklahoma, the latest received into the sisterhood of States, has enacted Sunday laws mainly copied from those of New York.

"Idaho is the only State in the Union where as yet no statutory provision is made for the protection of the weekly rest-day.

"In the District of Columbia, the Sunday laws which were in force at the time the district was ceded to the United States, are still nominally in force. A bill is now before Congress, and is understood to have the approval of the District Commissioners, to provide more effectually for the prevention of labor and traffic on Sunday."

This summary is given as showing the trend of public sentiment in the matter of Sunday legislation. At first glance, however, it is liable to be misleading. There seems to be a trend of public sentiment in the direction of greater Sunday liberty; but this is true only of the present sentiment as compared with the sentiment prevailing at the time the old laws were enacted. It must be remembered that most of the Sunday statutes of the States had their birth before the modern era of religious liberty. As compared with more recent times, the present sentiment respecting Sunday legislation shows a marked increase in the desire for Sunday enforcement.
