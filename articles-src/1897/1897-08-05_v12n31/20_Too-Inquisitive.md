Johnnie.—Mama, didn't you tell me I was born on Sunday?

Mama.—Yes, Johnnie; but why do you ask?

Johnnie.—Because, mama, I want to have a birthday celebration every Sunday.

Mama.—Why, Johnnie, that would be nonsense! You don't celebrate the day of the week when the event took place, but the day of the month, and that comes but once a year.

Johnnie.—But, mama, don't we celebrate every Sunday because the resurrection of Christ was on that day?

Mama.—Why—yes, Johnnie, of course; but—but—that's different; I can't explain to you just how, but you'll understand it when you get older. Run away now, and don't be asking so many questions.
