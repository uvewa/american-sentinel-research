Vol. 12, No. 31. Single Copy, 3 cents.

The American Sentinel is published in the interests of religious liberty—Christian and Constitutional.

"Any one receiving the American Sentinel without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore those who have not ordered the Sentinel need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it."
