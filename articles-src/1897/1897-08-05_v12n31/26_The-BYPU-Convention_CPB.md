July 15–18 the seventh annual international convention of the Baptist Young People's Union of America was in session in Chattanooga. About 7,000 delegates and visitors were present representing every section of the United States and the Dominion of Canada. Among the addresses of welcome was one by the mayor of the city, Hon. George W. Ochs. Among other things the mayor said:

"There is something so peculiarly American in the Baptist church that it appeals with especial force to the patriot. The church typifies liberty in its purest sense; liberty of soul, liberty of thought, liberty of action, liberty of conscience, the total separation of Church and State, the absolute independence of each separate church organization. It unites the jealous guardianship of sacred teachings of Scripture, with an equally vigilant watchfulness of the priceless jewels of liberty. In the formation of our national Constitution it was the Baptist church that stood inflexibly for full religious freedom, never receding from that position until victory was won.

"It was a Baptist pioneer, who in the dawn of our nation's history, first lighted the torch of religious liberty; he held it aloft, proclaiming that civil magistrates had no right to coerce the consciences of men, that the ritualism and formalism of a State church were obnoxious to soul liberty, that man's responsibility in religious matters was to God alone; and in spite of persecution, contumely and indignities he persevered and the sparks which showered from that blaze kindled by Roger Williams, lighted the fires which chastened our fundamental laws and perpetuated the principles which underlie the whole superstructure of our free institutions.

"By such teachings your church produces men and women who live in perfect fulfillment of our highest ideals, and thus it best serves society's needs; for the true source of a happy, a prosperous and a contented State, is a broad, liberal and independent church. These truths taught by your exalted society make your progress a resistless march of triumph and explain the marvelous strides you have made."

Nothing that the writer heard was so loudly applauded as was this tribute to the religious liberty principles of the Baptist church. But deserved as it was so far as the remote history of Baptists is concerned, it is greatly to be feared that many who bear the Baptist name to-day do not know the real meaning of the term, religious liberty. However, the official utterance of the convention concerning Sunday observance was very mild indeed. It does not necessarily include any but perfectly legitimate means. Resolution 6 reads:

"That we pledge ourselves to renewed efforts to secure a more general and fitting religious observance of the Lord's day, and to use all rightful and available means to check the growing tendency to secularize the day and give it over to worldly business and amusements."

All this might be done without any appeal to civil law, and is what consistency demands from every believer in Sunday sacredness; but unfortunately the speeches made in support of the resolution revealed the fact that in the minds of many Baptists, among the "rightful and available means to check the growing tendency to secularize the day and give it over to worldly business and amusements," Sunday laws occupy a prominent place.

One of the speakers, a Baptist pastor from Knoxville, in his words of welcome to those from other States, referred to the statute-intrenched Sunday of Tennessee, in these words: "We are proud to have you see among us, what others say is the truest Americanism in our fair land—an American sabbath; and we are trying to preserve it." This gentleman possibly did not know all that has been done in Tennessee to "preserve" this "American sabbath;" he possibly did not know how "soul liberty" for which Baptists of past generations contended and for which not a few of them laid down their lives, has in this closing decade of the nineteenth century been outraged in the State of Tennessee in the interests of the so-called "Americanism" which he is proud to exhibit to visitors from other States. Oh, that Baptists would be true to their history; true to the noble men and women who counted not their lives dear unto them that they might have conscience void of offense toward God; and above all, true to the principles of the glorious gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
