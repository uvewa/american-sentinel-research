In a certain Southern city, there is just now a rather abnormal zeal manifested in the matter of running down wicked violators of the "Sunday law." Certain Hebrews are among the chief sufferers from this spasm of virtue on the part of the municipal authorities. It is a well-known custom among the tailors of that race to take their work home and do it in their private apartments. Inasmuch as they are naturally clannish in their habits, the houses—nay, the entire neighborhoods, in many instances—wherein they elect to abide, are generally filled with them alone, so that nobody is likely to be disturbed by their pursuing their own national and traditional manner of living and acting.

It is a part of the religious life of these people to refrain from "worldly" or secular labor on the seventh day of the week. This they do in pursuance of a "commandment" which thousands of those "who profess and call themselves Christians" have read out to them in their churches on the first day of every week, without otherwise paying any attention to it whatsoever. That they may keep pace with competitors, these conscientious Hebrews must work on this first day, if they are to "observe" the seventh. The municipality in question has a "Revised Version" of its own. Therein, a certain famous text reads as follows: "One man esteemeth one day above another; another man esteemeth every day alike; let this be prevented by the police." The authorities have—in spasms—the courage of their convictions.

WHEREFORE, the blue coated missionaries of the gospel according to Puritanism are now amusing themselves in that town, and endeavoring to divert the public mind from their alleged intrigues with the gambling fraternity, by entering (with force and violence, where necessary), without the shadow of justification in law, without even the formality of "warrants" previously obtained, the dwellings of the unfortunate Hebrew tailors, dragging them forth, men, women and children, and carrying them off by scores to the station houses, all in the interest of true religion—and costs.

OF course, these "domiciliary visits" of the police, and their tyrannical behavior belong to the Russian system of civil administration, and have no place or excuse in free America. Equally of course, any policeman who might undertake thus to trespass vi et armis on the habitation of a wealthy citizen, or one of "high" social standing, would expose himself to the dangers of shotgun and revolver, which, under the circumstances, would be legally as available against him as against any private person who might venture to indulge in similarly outrageous conduct. But the average Hebrew tailor is poor, and as to his social standing, it is as the things that are not.

IN free America, every citizen is, by virtue of his citizenship, a conservator of the peace. Whatever judges may say, we must ever maintain as a political principle that no man in our country should have in this regard, rights, privileges or duties in any wise different from the rights, privileges and duties of every other man. What, then, is a policeman? He is simply a man who is paid a salary for devoting his attention exclusively to the duty of preserving the peace, etc., which duty all other free-men are expected to discharge without pay whenever occasion demands. Neither in the detection of crime, nor in the arrest of criminals, may an officer arrogate to himself other powers than those of citizenship. He may not break in a door, where the public interest would not justify another in so doing; he may not arrest without a warrant where by the general law a warrant is required; for false and malicious and causeless interference with the liberty of the citizen, he is as responsible as those are who unfortunately live without his blue cloth and brass buttons.

* * *

THE average policeman understands all this perfectly well; and he is careful not to exceed the legal limits of his authority where by so doing, he would subject himself to trouble at the hands of those who have money at their disposal, or possess that mysterious yet powerful attribute known to the initiated as "influence." When he wants to do what he knows he has no right to do, he visits the "down town" districts, and tramps about among the humble and lowly, and bullies and harries and "badgers" them to his full, and when he has the "Sunday law" as a lever, so to speak, his violations of the fundamental law of American jurisprudence and of the express language of State constitutions are hailed with delight and vociferously applauded by some excellent persons.

MANY of the Hebrews of whom I am speaking are peculiarly fitted to be the subjects of police usurpation and outrage. They come from Poland and from Russia. In their own country, violence is all they know of law. For centuries they have been ground down by the iron heel of military despotism. To them a uniform is the badge of irresponsible and often of malicious power. The notion that any one of them possesses a political "right" which a uniformed officer of the law is under any obligation to respect is a new one to them, and my observation of them leads me to believe that it can never be thoroughly comprehended or appreciated by the older immigrants, though the first generation born here, and those who arrive young enough to get the benefits of the public schools, take to freedom naturally enough.

But this is the inherent vice of all sumptuary laws, "which vex the citizen and interfere with individual liberty"—that they are not, and never, from their very nature can be, used for the vexation of any but the poorer classes in the community. If a rich man wants to work on Sunday, he goes to his store or office and gratifies his desire, and the policeman will never be born who will dream of objecting to the proceeding. It is only the day laborer, the toiling artisan who lives "from hand to mouth," whose scanty wage for hardest drudgery barely suffices to keep body and soul together—he alone it is whose liberty is curtailed under cover of the "Sunday law." Surely this inexorable fact alone is an all-sufficient reason why the representative body of a free government should "reform it altogether."

***

VIRTUE of the municipal sort is certainly spasmodic. But it is radical enough while the fit is on, in avowed purpose, if not in execution. And so, while Sunday tailoring is to be stopped in the town unmentioned, "Sunday club drinking" is also loudly doomed to go. The startling statement is printed that there are nearly three hundred "clubs" within the city limits, and that people drink liquor in them on the first day of the week. This the "grand jury" justly regard as calculated to bring down the wrath of Providence on the wicked burg, and they propose to put a stop to it in time.

***

THERE are, say, three hundred clubs. About six of these are what is called "fashionable." It is not denied that the members of all six get strong liquors at their respective clubs on Sundays, and pay for the same then and there (sometimes). Now, after all the flurry and flare and fuss and feathers of the proposed "crusade" are over, what will we find? If it be true that history repeats itself, and that human nature is pretty much the same at all times, we will find this—that a few "clubs," whose members are "workingmen"—that is to say, hand-workers, of one kind or another—and who are too poor to hire more than one room for their club meetings, have been broken up; and that not the slightest attempt has been made to break up one fashionable organization, whose members are "brain-workers" of one kind or another, or else absolute idlers, but are rich enough to own or to rent an entire house to meet in.

***

WHEN a mechanic's club has been "raided" on a Sunday and the members walk "up town" in a body and see at the great windows of palatial mansions rich men, attended by liveried waiters, engaged in precisely the same acts for which they have just been arrested and turned out into the street, their respect for American law and American justice, for American liberty and American equality, is not likely to be much enhanced. But this is the nature, again, of all sumptuary laws. And because of this, their nature, their existence is an evil and a menace; their administration a scandal and a reproach; and they ought to be reformed out of the statute book.

***

I HAVE NO animosity toward wealth. I have no desire to excite the poor against the rich. I do not advise the raided tailors, nor the members of a raided club, to set in motion a raid against a luckier body. Two wrongs do not make a right; and this sumptuary Sunday law would be just as objectionable if it were enforced against every body as it is now, when it is only enforced against poor people. It is the principle of the thing that offends justice.

***

I GO with anybody who happens to be going my way. And I know that there are many who will not listen to argument about principles, but will take sides with great ardor if you can point them to an undeniable evil of practice. All poor people—all toilers—all they of severe and narrow living—ought to band together against the Sunday law, if for no other reason, than that they alone suffer from its application. Its enforcement makes of them a distinct and branded class in the community. It surrounds them with police conditions on fifty-two days in the year from which the men of money are altogether exempt. It insults their intelligence and their manhood by proclaiming that they are not fit for the liberty accorded to others. It robs them of innocent pleasures. It puts a strait jacket on their bodies. It curtails the freedom of their souls by denying them the freedom of choice in their conduct that is part of American citizenship.
