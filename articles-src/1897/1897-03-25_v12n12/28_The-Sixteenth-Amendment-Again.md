### The "Sixteenth Amendment" Again.

The following joint resolution was introduced in Congress by Senator Gallinger, of New Hampshire, March 18. It was read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:—

"JOINT RESOLUTION

"Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States respecting an establishment of religion or the free exercise thereof.

"Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House concurring therein), That the following amendment to the Constitution of the United States be proposed for ratification by legislatures in the several States, which, when ratified by legislatures in three-fourths of the United States, shall be valid as a part of the said Constitution, namely:—

"'ARTICLE XVI.

"'Neither Congress nor any State shall pass any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or use the property or credit of the United States, or of any State, or any money raised by taxation, or authorize either to be used, for the purpose of founding, maintaining, or aiding, by appropriation, payment of services, expenses or otherwise, any church, religious denomination, or religious society, or any institution, society, or undertaking, which is wholly or in part under sectarian or ecclesiastical control.'"

This proposed "sixteenth amendment" has been before Congress on several previous occasions. It is aimed chiefly at the appropriations of public funds for sectarian schools, which Congress seems very reluctant to discontinue.
