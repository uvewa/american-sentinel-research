## True to Principle.

The Oklahoma Gleaner, a Seventh-day Adventist sheet published at Oklahoma City, prints the following in its issue of March 3:

"Sabbath, February 20, Brother T. Alexander was summoned to appear as a witness in a case on trial at the court room. It being the Sabbath he remained at home, whereupon the judge sent an officer, who placed him under arrest, and forced him to appear.

"Brother Alexander remembered the instruction of the Lord, 'Take no thought how or what ye shall speak,' but faced the judge, backed by his faithful friend, the Bible.

"Why have you contemned my court," said the judge, "by remaining away when summoned?"

"I do not hold your court in contempt," Brother Alexander replied, "but this is the Sabbath, and I cannot give testimony on this holy day."

"Do you mean to say that you will suffer the penalty of contempt of court rather than testify to-day?"

"Yes, sir, I will."

"But you are already here," protested the judge, "and you will not be giving evidence of your own free will, but by force."

"My Bible teaches me to obey God rather than man," said Brother Alexander. He was fully confident that he would be placed in jail for the offense, when the interested lawyers agreed to postpone the case to a time when Brother Alexander could be present without interfering with his principles of religious liberty, and he was permitted to return to his home."

This country, and every country, needs men of principle. It needs men who will be true to the dictates of conscience. And no legal sanction ought ever to be given to any effort to swerve an individual from these safeguards of his integrity.
