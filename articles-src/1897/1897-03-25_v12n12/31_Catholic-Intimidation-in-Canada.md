The following dispatch which was sent out from Ottawa by the Canadian authorities, March 9, should be set over against the claim made in the Pope's latest encyclical, that it is a most grievous injustice to the papal church to represent that she interferes in the affairs of the State: "The government has decided to withhold issuing the writ for an election in Champlain County, Quebec, until Parliament meets, when it will be announced to the House that owing to the attitude of the Roman Catholic bishops it would be impossible to hold a free election. Parliament will be asked to amend the criminal code to make it a criminal offense to exercise spiritual intimidation or influence in elections."
