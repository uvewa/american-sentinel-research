Discussion continues about the recent order of the commissioners of the District of Columbia, forbidding newsboys to cry the names of their papers in the streets of Washington on "the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday." These commissioners are three of the most absolute despots that modern times have known. The people over whose conduct and property they exercise an arbitrary and capricious control have no voice whatever in their selection. They are appointed by the president, "by and with the advice and consent of the Senate of the United States." No amount of tyranny, no acts of wantonness, no abuse of their enormous power imperils their places, unless the strangers to whom they are indebted for their elevation choose to pay attention to their proceedings. It is surely an anomalous state of affairs. Here is a government "of the people, by the people, and for the people," this great United States, based on the principle of suffrage; here is a country which fought for and won its independence to vindicate the doctrine that all civil authority derives its sanction and its exclusive sanction from the consent of those over whom it is exercised. And this unalterable principle, this undeniable doctrine is ignored at the very capitol of the nation! Suffrage abolished, consent repudiated, irresponsible authority enthroned in Washington City!

***

The silly and cruel "regulation" in regard to the crying of Sunday papers is only one of many petty outrages which the three arbitors of Washington's destiny have from time to time inflicted upon their fellow-citizens. One has to live in that unfortunate city fully to appreciate the opportunities these men have of annoying their "subjects," and the eagerness with which they avail themselves thereof. Nor is there any hope that this last unnecessary and unwarrantable infringement upon the right to the pursuit of life, liberty and happiness will be abandoned. The motto of the District Commissioners is "no step backwards." Their regulations are like those famous "laws of the Medes and Persians," which, it is said, could never be repealed or modified.
