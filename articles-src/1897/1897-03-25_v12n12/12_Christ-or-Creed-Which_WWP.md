## Christ or Creed; Which?

BY W. W. PRESCOTT.

When Christ came to this world as the bearer of life and light and love from God to man, He found that the plain teachings of God's Word had been obscured and even made of no effect through the teachings of those who were the leaders of the people; that religion had been made a burden upon the people; and that what God had given as a blessed means of union and communion with Him had been turned into a yoke of bondage. Much of His example and teaching was directed toward changing all this. He taught the people that religion was a life and not a mere form, ceremony or creed; and He presented the plain teaching of the Scripture as the basis of faith and the rule of conduct, even though it should be in open opposition to the customs and traditions of the time. He Himself was the gospel which He preached; and the word which had already been revealed in language, now "was made flesh" (John 1:14), and revealed in life. Thus Christ became the embodiment and the interpretation of all God's thought for man as set forth in the Scripture. But this brought Him into continual conflict with the religious teachers of his day, who placed their own traditions above the clearest statements of the Word of God.

To His disciples He said, "Follow Me," and then He lived before them, and taught them by precept, the Scriptures which He Himself had caused to be written (1 Peter 1:10, 11), "that the man of God may be perfect." 2 Tim. 3:16, 17. And when those who moulded the religious sentiment of the time asked him, "Why walk not Thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders?" He replied, "Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition . . . making the Word of God of none effect through your tradition." See Mark 7:5–13. "Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?" was His inquiry. Their ideas of the character of God and of religion, both in form and spirit, had become so distorted that when Jesus appeared among them, "the image of the invisible God," they persecuted Him because He would not conform to their ideas of religion, and even claimed scripture authority for putting Him to death (John 19:7), yet being all the time full of zeal for their creed. The experience of Saul, the Pharisee as told by himself (Gal. 1:13, 14), shows how the true spirit of religion may be wholly disregarded in the settled determination to maintain tradition and creed.

This conflict which was waged in Christ's time and against Him has been continued, in one form and another, ever since. In the Acts of the Apostles we have a record of the struggle on the part of the early disciples to establish the truth of the Bible, as lived and taught by Christ, as against the most determined effort on the part of those who professed to be the people of God to maintain the traditions and creed of the Church. Light was refused, and the power of the Holy Ghost was resisted (Acts 7:51) in the vain effort to put man's idea of religion and man's interpretation of the Scripture in the place of "the truth as it is in Jesus." It was in vain that Paul, the Christian, said: "I continue unto this day, . . saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come" (Acts 26:22), "believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets" (Acts 24:14), since their zeal for their creed was so much greater than their regard for what the Word of God taught.

These same experiences were repeated in the great Reformation of the sixteenth century. The Church had departed from the plain teaching of the Scripture, and had placed the authority of man and the traditions of the Church above the clearest statements of the Word of God. The sole and infallible authority of the Word of God was the primary and fundamental principle of the Reformation. Said the Reformers:—

"The Christians receive no other doctrines than those founded on the express words of Jesus Christ, of the apostles, and of the prophets. No man, no assembly of doctors, has a right to prescribe new ones."—D'Aubigne's History of the Reformation, book 3, chapter 9, par. 4.

When Luther at the Diet of Worms was asked to retract all that he had written contrary to the traditions and the creed of the Church, he appealed to the authority of the Bible, and said:—

"For this reason, most serene Emporer, and you most illustrious Princes, and all men of every degree, conjure you, by the mercy of God, to prove from the writings of the prophets and apostles, that I have erred. As soon as I am convinced of this, I will retract my error and be the first to lay down my books and throw them into the fire."—D'Aubigne, book 7, chapter 8, par. 50.

But the conflict is not ended, and the platform upon which the Reformers stood is the platform upon which to stand to-day,—an appeal to the plain teaching of the Word of God. All the truth was not seen by Luther and his associates, and their teaching can be safely followed only so far as it is in harmony with the principle which they themselves laid down, the appeal to the Word of God. The principle which is openly avowed by the Roman Catholic Church ("Tradition is to us more clear and safe"—Catholic Belief, p. 45) has received altogether too much sanction in some Protestant churches, and there is need that we "should earnestly contend for the faith once delivered to the saints," and should build only "upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief corner-stone."

Dr. Adolph Saphir has well said:—

"If we have the Spirit's teaching in the Book instead of the Spirit's teaching by the Book, men wish to have it extracted, simplified, reduced to a system, methodized. And then, practically speaking, the creed is above the Bible."

The following statements by Dr. George F. Pentecost are also well worthy of thoughtful consideration at this time:—

"The Church at the time of Christ's ministry on the earth had well nigh lost sight of the Scriptures by the accumulation of creeds, glosses, commentaries, and the like, so that they were more given to creeds and traditions and doctrines of men than they were to the Word of God. We are in the same danger now. . . It is a woful evil to substitute the authority of creeds and confessions of faith for that of the Word of God, which is the only rule of faith and practice for His people, and the only writing that is of binding authority upon the conscience. . . Whenever anyone yields obedience to the creeds of the churches, and surrenders the God-given right of personally searching the Scriptures to find out for himself the truth, then he indeed becomes a slave. . . Never surrender your conscience to any save God, and that on the sole authority of His Word."—In the Volume of the Book, p. 45.

Let every one heed these words, and follow the example of the "more noble" Bereans (Acts 17:10, 11), who "searched the Scriptures daily." All teaching is to be subjected to the test of the Word (Isa. 8:20), and only truth received. "Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ." Col. 2:8. "He that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked." 1 John 2:6. "If any man willeth to do His will, he shall know of the teaching." John 7:17, R. V. "He that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life." John 8:12. Are we ready to follow the plain instruction of the Bible, interpreted by the example and teaching of Christ, even though it be contrary to creed and tradition? This test of our Christianity.
