## A Wrong Diagnosis.

One of the worst mistakes that can be made in the treatment of disease is that of failing to correctly diagnose the nature of the malady from which the patient is suffering.

The would-be doctors of the body politic should take this fact into careful consideration. That there is something wrong, and that the patient is getting worse instead of better, is evident; and the remedy which they propose is that of religious legislation, in order to make it, as they say, "hard for people to do wrong and easy for them to do right." In this they are making the mistake so common to medical practitioners, of treating the symptoms instead of the disease.

They should have wisdom enough to discern that the symptoms indicate a malady too deeply seated to be reached by any remedial power in legislation.

There is abundant evidence indicating that the seat of the disease is in the heart, the very fountain of life, and not in the hands or feet. In other words, the malady is working insidiously but with deadliest results in the strongholds of morality, from which come the remedies that aim at moral reformation.

The Church is striving to reform politics, but she herself is most in need of reformation. Her representatives are loth to admit this; but many of them see it, and some candidly avow it. Among the latter is the well-known evangelist, Rev. A. B. Simpson, who says:—

"In my opinion the most discouraging features of the times are to be found in the fashionable religion of the day. There are too many loose views in churches themselves in regard to the inspiration of the Bible. There is also the all too prevalent habit of permitting the introduction of worldly things into the churches. There are too many entertainments in the churches themselves to raise funds—entertainments which sometimes are little better than theatrical performances."

Of those features that are not the "most discouraging," the same writer says:—

"We have missionaries in all lands, so I speak with authority when I say that I am convinced the world is wickeder than ever. As civilization advances, sin spreads. Civilized nations are wickeder than the uncivilized. New York and San Francisco are more sinful than Pekin and Singapore. I speak from personal observation, for I have been in all four cities.

"The desire for novelty is such that all kinds of new inventions in crime are taking place. Within a certain period there were 10,000 murders in the United States, and but 300 executions. Divorces are doubling every year or two. Society is getting worse and worse all the time. Public entertainments are becoming lower and lower in tone. I don't care to discuss notorious things, but society is ripening for judgment just as piety is ripening for the coming of the Lord."

Mr. Simpson does not, however, see a remedy for this state of things in legislation. On this point he says:—

"The only measures that I feel called upon to adopt to stem this tide of wickedness are wholly spiritual ones, such as the holding up of the divine truth. I believe, however, that it is quite right for law-abiding officials and public-spirited men to use all the restraints of government to check this onslaught of sin, but on the other hand I believe that the Government is no better than the society it represents. The real remedy is to be found in the religion of Christ.

"My remedy is to have not only churches and preachers, but to make the churches and preachers abandon all these worldly things and follow in the footsteps of Christ and his disciples.

"I do not believe that a mere transient revival, such as takes place at Cooper Union or Carnegie Hall, is going to accomplish all the needed reform. These revivals are good as far as they go, but what we want is a higher standard and a revival all the year round."

Could the Church expend her energies in any more profitable manner than that of seeking a deeper and more permanent revival and the erection of a higher standard of righteousness, in her own midst? Or is it better that she expend them in getting control of legislative power and through that seeking to reform politics? What, reader, is your opinion?
