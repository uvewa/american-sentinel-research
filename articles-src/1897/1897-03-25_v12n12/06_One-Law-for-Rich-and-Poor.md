## One Law for Rich and Poor.

In the London (Eng.) Westminster Review, Mr. R. Spence Watson makes the following pertinent observations on the subject of Sunday opening of museums and Sunday lectures:

"Two stock objections are made, both to the opening of museums and similar institutions on Sundays, and to the delivery of Sunday lectures; they involve a certain amount of labor, and certain payments are made to lecturers and others. I could appreciate the force of these objections if they did not apply with equal force to churches and chapels; and to domestic life. I say nothing about the splendid voluntary work which is done here and elsewhere, because that also is true of all these efforts alike. But I wish that those of our opponents who have their own gardens to walk in, their own libraries to read the books of their own choice in, their own pianos to listen to and pictures to look at, would put themselves, in thought, in the places of those whose choice lies between one or two poorly-appointed rooms, the cheerless Sunday streets, and the brilliant and crowded gin palace. Our English Sundays have too long pressed heavily upon those who do not wish to spend morning and evening alike in devotional exercises. To keep them as they have been, I believe to be wrong—altogether wrong—even from the religious point of view."
