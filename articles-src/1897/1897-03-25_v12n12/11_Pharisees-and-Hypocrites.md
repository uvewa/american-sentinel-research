THE Truth Seeker, a journal opposed to Christianity, in its issue of March 20, inquires: "Can anyone who has read the gospel story of Jesus Christ conceive of him as summoning a policeman to arrest a ten-year-old darkey boy for crying his papers in the streets of Washington, while the pharisees and hypocrites were sitting in the front pews of the churches? Can any stretch of imagination picture him as interfering with a game of ball in a vacant lot, played by lads who had no day but Sunday for recreation?"

Shame on the professed friends and followers of Christ who are doing in his name that which His avowed enemies declare would be entirely beneath His character.
