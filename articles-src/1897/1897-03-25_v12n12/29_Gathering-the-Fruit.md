### Gathering the Fruit.

In the Catholic Standard and Times, of March 6, "Father" David, a high authority among English Catholics, gives his answers to a questioner relative to the result of the Pope's recent decision on "Anglican orders," as follows:—

"'Did the decision on Anglican orders bring you a notable windfall?'

"'Yes. There has been a rush since. The clergymen have shown that they only wished to get Rome's confirmation of their opinion and status and not reunion. Very few, half a dozen only, of them have come over. But many of the people whom they kept back with unreal assurances about the validity of orders have made a rush.'

"'And the others?'

"'The others are still held back, many of them not for long. The question is: How long the High Anglicans or Ritualists will be able to restrain the tendency towards Catholicism. Men are breaking from the lines daily. Were there a commotion a body might pass over. There are only two million communicants in the Church of England, though she counts about twelve million adherents. Of these two millions the Ritualists are sixty thousand. They are no power at all in the country, but a strong influence in the towns. A hundred chances may make their position untenable. They may grow and acquire more and more influence, but their progress is only a better omen. Eventually there must come a breakage. Already the dyke which their clergymen have formed strains under its burden of waters. A chance impulse from behind may make it break. Their position is logically untenable and practically precarious.'"
