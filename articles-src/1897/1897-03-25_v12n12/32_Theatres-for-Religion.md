Speaking of the revival work carried on by a prominent Brooklyn clergyman at Cooper Union every afternoon, the New York Journal says: "In this work the Rev. Mr. Dixon has adopted the plan of carrying religion into secular places instead of expecting the people to come to church for it, and yesterday he said that it was proposed to hire during the summer every theatre in New York on Sunday nights for preaching, for it had been found that the people would go to a hall or a theatre to hear of religion, but would not go to church. This is a curious indictment of the church."

It is little wonder that the cause of Christianity moves so slowly and seems to demand the "help" of legislation when affairs are so managed in the churches that the "house of God" is one of the last places the common people can be induced to enter.
