Whatever the result of the Cretan complication, it is to be borne in mind that it will have nothing whatever to do with differences of religion. The "Powers," as they are called, will settle the matter—probably without war—on a political basis alone, and with reference to their own selfish interests. It is safe to say that neither the fact that the Cretans "profess and call themselves Christians," while the Turks are of a different and a hostile faith, nor the real merits of the original controversy—whatever these last may be—will play any conspicuous figure in the final settlement of the matter. The "Sick man of Europe" has long lain at the mercy of these "Powers." They would have killed him years ago, if they could have agreed among themselves just how his property ought to be divided up. Upon this point they seem as far from a common conclusion as they have ever been. But whether he is to owe a further prolongation of his existence to their inability to "come together" now, as in the past, or whether he is ultimately dismembered forever, benefit to Christianity may be an incidental outcome, but will form no part of the design. Christianity, as represented in modern statecraft, finds its expression in the blessings of battle-flags, and in profound thanksgivings for the slaughter of hostile armies, not in the application of the Golden Rule.
