At a recent monthly meeting of the Cleveland City Ministers' Union, the subject of Sunday ball playing was considered, and a committee was appointed to wait on the city authorities and demand the enforcement of the law against Sunday desecration. In case the authorities refuse to act in the matter, the ministers of the city will be requested to preach on "Sabbath observance" the fourth Sunday in April.
