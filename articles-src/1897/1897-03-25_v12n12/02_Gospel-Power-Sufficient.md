But why will the Church seek for political power? Why will the Christian seek for such power? The Church and the individual Christian are commissioned to preach the gospel, which is "the power of God unto salvation, to every one that believeth." Rom. 1:16. Nothing but the power of godliness can suffice for the Church in any undertaking pursuant to her divine calling; and nothing but the "power of God unto salvation" can suffice to save any individual from sin. There is no lack of this divine power; and God is no less willing to bestow it now than he was to pour it out on his Church at Pentecost. The only question is, Will the Church give Him the opportunity?
