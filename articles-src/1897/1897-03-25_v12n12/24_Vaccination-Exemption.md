A curious decision is reported to have been made recently by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, to the effect that persons can be properly exempted from the regulations enforcing vaccination, on the ground that they have conscientious scruples against it. The case came to the Supreme Court from Beloit, where certain "Christian scientists" opposed vaccination as being "a violation of the laws of God." The remarkable thing about this is not that "Christian scientists" should take this position, but they should be sustained in it by a body of men who are supposed to possess sound judgment.
