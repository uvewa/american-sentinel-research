The Kansas City Star, of March 10, reports that the Supreme Court of Kansas will soon render a decision on the question of the constitutionality of Bible reading and religious worship in the public schools of that State. The father of a young boy in one of the schools of Barber County has brought suit against the school directors over the expulsion of his boy from school for refusing to take part in the religious exercises with which the school was opened. The case was first carried to the District Court, which granted a writ compelling the board of directors to cancel their decree of expulsion. Now both parties will now contest the matter before the highest State tribunal.
