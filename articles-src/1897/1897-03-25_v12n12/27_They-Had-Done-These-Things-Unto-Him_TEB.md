## "They Had Done These Things Unto Him."

BY T. E. BOWEN.

What the Lord did while here on earth had, to a great extent, been written out beforehand. Having himself become thoroughly familiar with these writings of the prophets, he was aware that at different points in his experience what he did was fulfilling Scripture. His disciples were not so conversant with the then written word, and therefore were not aware that the things Jesus did fulfilled the things written of the Christ to come. Had they known—as it was their privilege—it would have been much easier for them to have believed him the true Anointed One—the sent of God.

It was an enemy's work to blind their eyes to the true meaning of the Scriptures referring to Christ's earthly mission. As a result their enemy knew it would be an easy thing to cause them to stumble along in unbelief. "These things understood not his disciples at the first, but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him." John 12:16. Yes, they had been fulfilling the Scriptures and did not know it. In this instance it was a good thing they had done, that of waving palm branches and spreading their garments before him as he rode into Jerusalem; but this was not always the case. Sometimes in their unbelief they were found on the wrong side fulfilling Scripture.

Judas' case represents this point. It had been foretold that one who had often gathered about the same board with Christ should lift up his heel against his Lord. Again of the betrayal scene Zechariah had written: "And I [Judas foreseen in the act] said unto them [chief priests], If ye think good, give me for my price thirty pieces of silver." Chap. 11:12. Did Judas realize he was fulfilling this Scripture when he "covenanted with them for thirty pieces of silver"? No. But Jesus knew the prophet's words, and while Judas might have known and been saved, still his eyes were blinded by covetousness, and he rushed on to his fearful doom. When too late he saw what he had done.

The lesson is for us. Scripture is still being fulfilled and will be unto the end. God's Word speaks of oppressive religious laws which will be in force when Christ comes. Some of these laws are now in existence, and some no doubt are still to be made. Men of influence will act a part in these things. Their voice may be raised in support of enactments which will result in crushing out individual liberty to serve God "according to the dictates of conscience," and which are also in direct opposition to the principles found in God's Word.

Reader, search the Scriptures, lest when too late you find out "that these things were written of him," and that you have "done these things unto him" in the person of his followers: for "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."
