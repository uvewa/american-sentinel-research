### No Authority for the Puritan Sunday.

Outside of England and America, no one—Protestants no more than Catholics—pretends that Sunday is the Sabbath commanded in the laws of Moses. . . . The Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and all Slavonic languages have for Saturday a name derived from "Sabbath"—such are Sabado, Sabbato, Sobota—and the French Samedi and German Samstag are drawn from the same root. The very Sabbatarians of England and America call Sunday the first day of the week, in the same breath in which they quote the fourth commandment in Exodus 20, for the sanctity of the seventh day. Moreover, the day there commanded must in its very nature begin with sunset: for a man is enjoined to remember it, to keep it holy, in plain English to greet its advent, and that can hardly be done with the Sunday-Sabbath which begins at twelve o'clock at night, when most good Christians are asleep.—American Hebrew.
