As if to prove that the "trust" idea is susceptible of universal application, the Memphis Commercial Appeal outlines a plan for "farmers' trusts," by which, it says, "farmers would be better able to dictate the prices of their products." Farmers owning land in the same vicinity should, it says, "make a pool of their acres; the amount and quality of land, the stock, implements, etc., will represent the shares each man puts into the firm. Then, having agreed upon each man's position as to work and returns, the lands are carefully examined and such portions as are specially suited for different crops are portioned off for that purpose; thus the land that A has been putting into cotton and getting poor results from may be found just the soil for potatoes, and B's pasture may make an ideal cornfield. With so much space to cultivate no seed need be put into the wrong soil and, receiving sufficient attention, the yield will be what it should. This is one benefit to result from the partnership. Another is the immense gain of purchasing by wholesale instead of in small quantities, as the farmers now buy their supplies not raised at home. The division of labor, too, would have its advantages, for few men are good at all things, and in the 'combine' each one would undertake that for which he is best fitted."

Of course, there would be in this the same submersion of individuality in the interests of the "combine" that exists in any other trust. All trusts are, from their very nature, destructive of the spirit of independence.
