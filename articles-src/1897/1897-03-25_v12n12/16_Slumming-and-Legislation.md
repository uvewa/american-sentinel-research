## Notes of the Week.

That decidedly objectionable practice of "slumming," which, a few years ago, was quite a popular "fad," has just been revived in this city by a party of Yale students of theology. It is gratifying to read that they were "surprised" at the discovery that there were no "real slums" in New York; that they paid twenty-five cents each for a bed in a down-town lodging-house, and the beds were clean, and the breakfast next morning was "substantial" in quality and well cooked. But the question still remains—what were these students of theology doing to help themselves to improve their characters as future spiritual guides of their fellowmen, to make the world better and purer and happier, by their "slumming"?

***

Perhaps the "slumming" was of a mild order. Perhaps those under whose guidance the slummers were might have shown them many sights more repulsive than those clean beds, and taken them into many places where crowds of people manage to subsist on meals by no means substantial, or well cooked, and simply did not choose to do so. If this were the fact, they were truly kind to the young theological students. Nothing good ever yet came of clerical "slumming." There can be no manner of doubt that one of its direst results is "sensationalism" in the pulpit. But the greatest objection to it is that it is usually the prelude to that interference by preachers *as* preachers in the work of legislation and police management which constitutes one of the most objectionable manifestations of the union of Church and State, as it exists among us at the present time.

***

Of course, this interference is based on the idea that, somehow or other, men can be legislated into righteousness. Time seems to accomplish but little in the way of getting this notion out of the head of average mankind. The fact that the Master talked to individuals alone; that salvation and redemption are in their very essence matters which belong to the relation between each separate soul and its Creator, and that neither the laws nor the force of the community can affect that relation in any manner or to any degree whatsoever—this simple truth is ignored now to pretty much the same extent that it was ignored when the first union of the self-styled Christian Church with the State was consummated under the pagan Emperor Constantine. Clergymen who "slum" and follow their slumming by sensational activity in civil affairs, are the intellectual descendants of the bishops who persuaded the pagan emperor to enact the first Sunday law.
