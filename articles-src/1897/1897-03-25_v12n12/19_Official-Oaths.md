The President takes "an oath of office," placing his hand on a Bible. Why? If he broke that oath, he could not be indicted for perjury. The ability of the law to punish him for malfeasance or misfeasance in the discharge of his high and important duties as the chief executive officer of a land containing seventy-five millions of people is in no wise affected by the question of whether he has or has not taken an oath faithfully to perform those duties. His assumption of them, as the sequence of his election, fairly made and duly announced, according to the Constitution and the statutes, is sufficient to expose him to all the worldly penalties that can be attached to any dereliction in their discharge. What, then, is the object and purport of this "official oath," which is taken by our State administrators, from august President down to petty "deputies" of country villages?

***

The answer is plain to those who are fair-minded enough to look the matter squarely in the face. But one answer will be given by all who are also candid enough to confess the truth. The administration of an official oath is simply and solely the recognition of a religious dogma in this free American Union of ours, and an attempt on the State's part or the part of the United States, as the case may be, to avail herself of certain supernatural terrors, in order to secure fidelity and scrupulousness among her servitors. That is to say, the Government invokes in its own behalf and for its own protection a certain belief as to "the hereafter" which is plainly a matter exclusively of ecclesiastical cognizance. This is traveling altogether outside of the proper limitations of governmental action, according to what is affirmed to be the American theory of government.

Nor is it any answer to this objection against the administration of official oaths, to assert, as some do, that the State does not undertake to threaten the new official with any particular punishments in the next world, when he "swears him into office," but leaves that matter to the conscientious anticipations of such swearer. The point is, that she recognizes, in this performance, the existence of religion, and its existence as a factor in human conduct, and thereby sets up a distinction between a religious citizen and a non-religious citizen, and thereby again violates that fundamental equality of all religions and of no religion before the law which is the very cornerstone of American institutions.

***

Nor is it any answer to this objection, to instance the case of a man who "affirms," instead of swearing, when he enters on the discharge of public duties. The utter silliness of this proceeding is so patent that, if we could get rid of the oath, the affirmation would soon follow. The responsibility of a State officer for the proper and thorough performance of his obligations to the community does not depend in the slightest degree on his "affirmance" of an intention to do his duty. If he were indicted for failure therein, nobody would dream of resting his responsibility on such an affirmation. It would be utterly superfluous to allege that he made it or to put it in evidence. His responsibility would arise out of his assumption of the functions of his place. The "affirmance," then, of a newly inducted official, amounts to nothing whatever; the oath to nothing more, except as an appeal by the State to considerations with which she has no concern whatsoever, and with which she has no right to intermeddle. Let us get rid of them both.
