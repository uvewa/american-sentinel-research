## The Crisis in Theology.

"New York Observ e."

If we are not very much mistaken, one outstanding fact challenges attention at the present time which is full of very serious suggestion as to the spiritual future of America. It is the widespread denial of the supernatural. At the idea of the supernatural, which underlies the whole of the Christian religion, the drive of criticism is tremendous and constant. Never was that idea more uncongenial than it is at present. Scientific theorizing has had something to do with this result, though science has never proved the supernatural out of existence, and now philosophic and religious speculations are helping to swell the outcry against the notion of the miraculous. Much of biblical criticism, too, of the form at present popular, is really in spirit and method the secret foe of supernaturalism.

Of the critical mode of banishing the supernatural from the Bible, Professor Green, of Princeton, has well remarked that it is the most plausible as well as the most effective method of accomplishing this result, because the animus of the movement is concealed, and the desired end is reached not by aiming at it directly and avowedly, but as the apparently incidental consequence of investigations pursued professedly for a different purpose.

It is in view of such facts as these that the gravity of the situation, which even amounts to a theological crisis, appears. That here and there a teacher, perhaps a clergyman, should stand forth as the exponent of radical views of biblical criticism might not be so alarming a circumstance, but when we perceive that such utterances are excused or even applauded by multitudes, that they delude Christians and delight infidels, we are forced to recognize that this radicalism is symptomatic of a widespread decadence of belief in the supernatural. A single miracle might supposedly be denied by some individual who reverently accepted others, but it is not to be supposed that when even a single miracle is denied in a rationalizing spirit any miracles at all will long remain credible and accepted. It is the tendency of the thing that makes it to be so full of menace.

It is not so much that a few bold speculators deny these signs and wonders which God showed in the days of old as that multitudes are languidly indifferent to the whole destructive process or are even arousing themselves to apologize for the ruthless iconoclasm. Stripped of all irrelevancies, with which the critics of the truth love to surround their mystifying discussions, the great philosophic effort of the day, from the side of unfaith, is to prove the needlessness, even the ridiculousness, of the supernatural. And if in many cases this effort amounts to an assumption rather than an argument, and is more a drift than a discussion, the seriousness of the situation is thereby not relieved, but rather increased. That is not a real faith in the Scriptures which empties the Bible of its miracles. And with reference to these people who are picking and choosing in their methods of Scripture study a New York newspaper pertinently remarks that "such men do not believe in the Bible. They only believe in the things in the Bible which commend themselves to their belief." They only believe in it as they believe in any other book. It is well worth while to consider whether these things are so. Are we not passing through a serious theological crisis?
