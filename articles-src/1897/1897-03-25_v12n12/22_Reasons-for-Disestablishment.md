## Reasons for Disestablishment.

While the churches in this country are seeking for closer union with the State, in England, where the church is "established" and controlled by the State, there is a strong sentiment in favor of severance of the bonds between them. This sentiment finds expression from time to time in Parliament, in the form of resolutions for disestablishment. Recently, says the *Outlook* (New York), such a resolution was introduced "on the ground that the Church was under the control of the State, its bishops being practically appointed by the Prime Minister, who might be an atheist; that presentations to livings are bought and sold; that it is becoming anti-Protestant, and that it receives an undue and unfair prestige from its alliance with the State. It was also urged," says the *Outlook*, "that the Church had been unfavorable to civil liberty in the past; that the bishops had opposed the anti-slavery movement; and that an established church is an anachronism at this end of the nineteenth century. The mover of the resolution declared that the Established Church must either be mended or ended; that it could not be mended by a body like the English Parliament, and that, therefore, it must be ended."

These are just grounds of objection to the continuance of Church establishment, and that they are true cannot be denied. It would seem that the lesson they teach should be sufficient to deter enlightened Protestants in this land from an alliance with the State; yet evidently such is not the case.

From a comparison of tables of statistics showing the growth of the Established Church or Church of England, and of the "free churches"—Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, etc., the fact appears that establishment has not prevented the latter from outgrowing the Church of England to a very decided extent. "Establishment" is only a misleading name for that which does not strengthen the English church, but is a millstone about her neck.
