A Senate Committee of the Maine legislature gave a hearing March 4, on the following bill for a stricter observance of the "Sabbath":—

"Whoever on the Lord's day fires or discharges any rifle, shot gun, revolver, pistol or other firearm, except as an act of necessity, shall be punished by a fine of $10 and costs of prosecution, for each offense."

Hon. L. T. Carleton presented the bill and spoke in its favor; and Messrs. Huffman and Lamb, Seventh-day Adventists, appeared against it. Of their opposition and the result of the hearing, the Bangor Weekly Commercial of March 12, says:—

"They both carried leather-covered Bibles and quoted Scripture to the committee in support of their position and to maintain their declaration that the seventh day of the week is the Sabbath day. Elder Huffman had numerous tilts with Mr. Carleton, and the bright Kennebec lawyer, who is something of a student of Holy Writ himself, found more than his match. The crowd which gathered about had a fine entertainment. The committee voted to report the bill with an amendment that it shall only apply to cities, towns and organized places, as the bill as originally drawn would prevent the firing of a gun up in the backwoods of Maine."
