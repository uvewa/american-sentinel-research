## The "Labor Trust" in Court.

As has been noticed in these columns, the principle of the "trust" is just as susceptible of being used against individual liberty by the organizations of labor, as by those of capital. An instance in illustration of this has come before the public through some decisions of the courts, the last of which was from the court of final appeal. The case is given the following notice in the New York Times:

"For some six years a case has been wending its slow way through the courts of this State, which, reaching the Court of Appeals, has brought out a decision of great importance as to what we have ventured to call the labor trust. It is a suit brought in 1891 by a workman in a brewery in Rochester against a branch of the Knights of Labor to recover damages on the ground that he had been deprived of the opportunity to work because he would not join the local assembly. The assembly pleaded a contract with the brewers' organization by which the latter agreed not to employ for more than four weeks any man who would not join the assembly, pay its dues, and submit to its rules. This the workman refused to do, was discharged, and afterward was unable to secure employment. He won his case in the lower courts, and has now got a decision in the court of final appeal. The court says:

"Public policy and the interests of society favor the utmost freedom in the citizen to pursue his lawful trade or calling, and if the purpose of an organization or combination of workingmen be to hamper, or to restrict, that freedom, and, through contracts or arrangements with employers, to coerce other workingmen to become members of the organization, and to come under its rules and conditions, under the penalty of the loss of their positions, and of deprivation of employment, then that purpose seems clearly unlawful, and militates against the spirit of our Government and the nature of our institutions. The effectuation of such a purpose would conflict with that principle of public policy which prohibits monopolies and exclusive privileges. It would tend to deprive the public of the services of men in useful employments and capacities.'

"Nor will the court admit that the agreement was justified as a means of avoiding disputes. It says:—

"'While it may be true, as argued, that the contract was entered into on the part of the Ale Brewers' Association with the object of avoiding disputes and conflicts with the workingmen's organization, that feature and such an intention cannot aid the defense nor legalize a plan of compelling workingmen, not in affiliation with the organization, to join it, at the peril of being deprived of their employment and of the means of making a livelihood.'"

The argument of the court recognizes that the "labor trust" is conducted upon the same principles as is any other trust, and merits condemnation upon the same grounds as have been set forth against the combinations of capital; only it would seem that it is somewhat easier to deal with the labor trust through the courts than with those which are representative of wealth.
