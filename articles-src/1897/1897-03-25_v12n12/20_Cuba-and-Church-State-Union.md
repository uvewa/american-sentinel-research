The war in Cuba still drags its slow length along. Nowhere in history do the terrible evils of a united Church and State more strikingly manifest themselves than in the misgovernment of Cuba by the dominant Spaniards. Spain, as is well known, has an expensive and extravagant State church at home, which must be supported by taxes wrung from a distressed and impoverished people. Millions of money going to the maintenance of its priesthood in lines of idleness and luxury are annually contributed by the unwilling inhabitants of Cuba. This oppression has before now proven unbearable, and desperate efforts have been made to shake off the galling yoke. If there were no other reason, this should be sufficient to enlist the sympathies of all true Americans on the side of the insurrectionists. But, query, if—or, let us say when, they are free, will they saddle themselves with the yoke of a domestic established church, like unto that of the foreign country which now holds them down under its heel?
