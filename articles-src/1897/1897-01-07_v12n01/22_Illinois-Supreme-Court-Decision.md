The Illinois Supreme Court has decided that, "The statute providing that no female shall be employed in any workshop or factory more than eight hours per day, or forty-eight hours per week, is unconstitutional, because such a statute deprives persons of the privilege of contracting, which is both a privilege and a property right, without due process of law, and makes an arbitrary interference with private contracts, which cannot be justified as an exercise of the police power." That is justice.
