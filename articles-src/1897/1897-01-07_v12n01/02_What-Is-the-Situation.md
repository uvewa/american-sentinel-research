Let us glance at original principles, that we may the better understand what the situation is, that "all will have to accept."

Everybody knows that upon principle, and by express provision of the supreme law, the Government of the United States was established not only without any recognition of religion, but with the exclusion of religion, and specifically the Christian religion. This was done, too, because of respect to the Christian religion—that the infinite Spirit of eternal truth might move in its freedom, and purity, and power," and that here there might be no encroachments upon the prerogatives of God.

Thus the Government of the United States was established in truth upon the Christian basis: in that its fundamental principles and supreme law were in exact harmony with the provisions announced by Jesus Christ with respect to the total separation that should be maintained between His religion and the jurisdiction of the State, between the kingdom of God and the governments of this world.

Thus America became to all the world "the classical land" of religious liberty. Therefore no step could ever be taken against this order of things in the Government, without attacking religious liberty: no thing could ever be done toward governmental recognition of the Christian religion, without being against the plain word of Christ, as well as against the fundamental principles and the supreme law of the Government itself.

This was all plain enough to all who cared to consider that the principles of Christ and the good of mankind were of more importance than their own opinions. And this is why the American people have been so slow to believe that there could be any danger to religious liberty, any danger of the establishment of a national religion, in this country: they would not believe that there could ever be enough people in this country who would become antichristian, to change the order of things in which the Government of the United States was founded, and which it represented to all the world.

By the year 1886, however, those who established the AMERICAN SENTINEL considered that there was sufficient indications of this approaching danger to justify the publishing of a paper which should be devoted to the maintenance of the principles of Christianity represented in the fundamental principles and the supreme law of the Government of the United States; while at the same time it should watch closely to detect and expose every motion that might be made toward securing the governmental recognition of religion.

In 1892, the Supreme Court of the nation committed the judicial department of the Government to the recognition of the "Christian religion" as a governmental thing by declaring that "organic utterances" and the "meaning" of the Constitution prove that "this is a Christian nation," in accordance with original documents whose "purpose" was "the establishment of the Christian religion" in this country. And by another decision in 1895, the Court has shown that it adheres to this doctrine.

In 1892, also, Congress committed the legislative department of the Government not only to the recognition of the "Christian religion" as a governmental thing, but to the recognition of that particular phase of it that is represented in Sunday observance: and in 1893, by direct action, confirmed that which it had done in 1892.

In 1892, the President of the United States committed the executive department of the Government to the recognition of the "Christian religion" as a governmental thing by approving the action of Congress. In addition to this, in 1896, the President of the United States, in a Thanksgiving proclamation, again committed the executive department of the Government, specifically, to the "Christian religion" as a governmental thing; and shortly afterward followed it up with the ominous declaration that "this is a Christian nation, and it is only a question of time when all will have to come to accept the situation."

Now it is undeniable that these three departments—the legislative, the judicial, and the executive—are the Government of the United States. It is also undeniable that these three departments have, by repeated action, committed themselves to the recognition of the "Christian religion" as a governmental thing. It is therefore also undeniable that in spite of the plain words of Jesus Christ; and in spite of the fundamental principles and the supreme law of the nation; the Government of the United States has been dragged into the recognition of the "Christian religion;" and in the antichristian sense in which such a term is always used, has been made a "Christian government."

What more could possibly be necessary to the accomplishment of such a thing? Was it essential that all three branches of the Government should take such step, in order that it might truly be said that the Government had done it? All three have definitely and intentionally taken such step. Was it essential that all three branches of the Government should by repeated action take such step, in order that it might truly be said that the Government had done it? All three, by repeated action, have done it. And, as though to put a climax to the whole scheme, the President gives notice not only that "this is a Christian nation," but that it is only a question of time when "all will have to accept the situation," and "face the music."

Yet this is not to say that all has been done that will be done. Not by any means; for such evil tide once a-flowing, will not cease until it shall have overflow, reached even to the neck; and filled the breadth of the land. This is to say, however, what cannot be disproved, that the particular, the essential, thing of the recognition of a governmental national religion, has been accomplished by the Government of the United States. And when more shall have been done in this direction, it matters not what it may be, it is impossible for it to be the doing of any new thing. All that it can possibly be is but the enlarging and deepening of the thing that has already been done.
