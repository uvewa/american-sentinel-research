Turkey is Mohammedan, Spain is "Christian." Armenia has long been trying to throw off the Turkish yoke, and establish her independence. For this reason Armenians have suffered many atrocities at the hands of Turkish soldiers. However, leading Armenians counted on this very thing, and calculated that it would bring them sympathy and assistance from the "Christian nations." They have had much clamorous sympathy, and some assistance in the way of needed provisions and clothing for destitute sufferers, but they have not succeeded in securing what they expected—assistance to gain their political independence. The "Christian nations" have been terribly berated by "Christian" enthusiasts because they have not taken up carnal weapons in defense of "Christian" Armenia's political freedom.

On the other hand, Cuba, fully as much Christian as Armenia, has long been struggling for emancipation from her "Christian" tyrant, Spain. Cruel depredations upon innocent non-combatants, as cruel as any perpetrated by the Turks, have been reported time and again from Cuba. Of course these have been denied by Spain; but woe to the foreigner, of whatever nation, who should undertake to make personal investigation, as has been done by many private individuals in Turkey. Woe to the relief committee who should undertake to carry relief to the destitute sufferers in Cuba. Foreigners who are known to sympathize with the Armenians are safer in Constantinople than they are in Havana if even suspected of sympathizing with the suffering Cubans.

The latest advices from Havana state that all the Americans in that city are designated as "pigs," by the Spaniards, and live in constant anticipation of violence, just because they are Americans, and because the Spanish people and soldiers know that the Cuban insurgents have received some aid from the United States through filibustering parties. The bloodthirsty disposition of many of the people, it is authoritatively stated, has to be satiated by bull-fights to keep down their indignation because the insurgents are not overcome by the Spanish forces.

And it is safe to assume that all of this class of citizens are loyal to "the Church," and would fight for it to the death. Nor is the enjoyment of brutal scenes confined to either the Turks or Spaniards; the prize-fights, the football games, the horse-races, etc., are lavishly patronized in all the "Christian nations." And in all of them the more they indulge in carnal warfare, the greater is the lust for bloody scenes. And this fact ought to be considered before encouraging military organizations among the children and young people in the churches. We cannot expect that an education in the exercise of carnal weapons will develop adepts in the use of the "sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God;" for "what concord hath Christ with Belial?" The use of this world's weapons and its modes of warfare have the same deteriorating effect upon human nature in all lands, whether employed by Moslem or professed Christian. Their employment invariably tends to quench the Spirit of Christ.
