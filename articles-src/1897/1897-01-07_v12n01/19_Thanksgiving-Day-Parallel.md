The position now held by Thanksgiving Day is a perfect illustration of how Sunday became a holy day. At first it was celebrated by individuals upon their own motion. Next it received governmental recognition only in a general way, becoming gradually more special as time went on; then at last finding recognition by government as distinctly a Christian thing. When it reached this point it became too "holy" a thing to bear without serious "desecration" such worldly exercises as common labor or games of ball, etc. The next step that may be looked for is the demand for a law forbidding the interruption and desecration of the "holy" associations and character of the "sacred" day.

When it was first recognized by the Government in a general way, this was considered a worthy tribute to the value of religion in general, to the Government. When it was recognized by the Government in a distinctly Christian sense, this was counted as a more worthy tribute to the value of "Christianity and its institutions," to the Government. And now if only a law can be secured "to protect the day from desecration," this will be a most worthy tribute to the value of "Christianity and its institutions," to all the people. And whether a person believes in Christianity and its institutions or not, he must be compelled to obey the law and observe the institution "for civil and sanitary reasons;" and because "religion or rights of conscience does not enter into the matter at all, it is simply a matter of law."

As the Christian Statesman has declared, and what is most likely the truth, that "President Cleveland's proclamation will be a precedent for generations to come;" "and not only will Thanksgiving proclamations continue to be issued, but they will have more generally a distinctively Christian character"—we may expect to see such a course pursued with reference to its observance, as we have described. Then Thanksgiving Day will be just as sacred and just as holy as Sunday is now. For then it will have just the sanctions that Sunday has, and will rest upon just such authority as Sunday does.
