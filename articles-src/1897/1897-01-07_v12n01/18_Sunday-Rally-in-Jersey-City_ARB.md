A RALLY under the auspices of the American Sabbath Union was held Tuesday evening, December 15, at the Summit Avenue Baptist Church, Jersey City, N. J. The subject discussed was "The American Sabbath; its relation to good citizenship and Christian progress;" ten minute addresses being delivered by the several speakers representing the Christian Endeavor Society, the Epworth League, the Baptist Young People's Union, and the Society of Andrew and Philip.

The meeting was presided over by Rev. Dr. Brett, of the Dutch Reformed Church, and in his opening remarks he referred to Isa. 58:13, 14: "If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable; and shalt honor him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: then shalt thou delight thy-self in the Lord;" as being just what the Lord wanted of man in regard to the American sabbath.

The first speaker said he believed in the Sabbath. He believed that the ten commandments stood to-day as when God gave them on Sinai, not one having been abrogated.

He believed in the enforcement of sabbath (Sunday) laws, yet said he would fight against any law enforcing religious principles. The sabbath laws, said he, were not enforced to make men religious, but for society's good.

The pastor of the church spoke in behalf of the Baptist Young People's Union.

Among other things, he said, "We are determined to stand without swerving for the proper observance of the sabbath. We are scriptural in all things, and we are scriptural in this."

The next speaker in his remarks said: "We are here to stand for the fourth commandment. . . . Sabbath breaking is a mark of a backslidden church. It is time," said he, "we were getting back to the law of God."

The representative of the Christian Endeavor Society laid all the blame for sabbath (Sunday) desecration on the church, excusing the world "because they did not know the seventh day to keep it holy." Another speaker hoped that the time would soon come when all business except works of necessity and charity would cease on the sabbath, or at least, said he, if stores had to be opened, that it would be only for a little while sabbath morning.

What a ridiculous position to take! Claiming to stand for truth against error; claiming the Bible as their only guide; claiming the Sabbath as a sign between God and his people; these men confederate together, their object being the preservation of a day which God in all the Bible never once calls the sabbath!

At the close of the meeting, the writer, who was formerly a member of this church under another pastorate, had a short interview with the pastor. He was asked the question, "Do not the Baptists claim to be strictly biblical in all their doctrine, claiming no other guide than the Bible?" Replying in the affirmative, he was asked, "Where in all the Bible can be found warrant for such a meeting as has just been held?" Pleading ignorance of the meaning of this question, he was asked, "Where in all the Bible can it be found that the first day of the week, Sunday, is called the Sabbath?" His answer was "Oh, that's a question for every man to settle in his own mind." On being asked the question, "What saith the scripture?" his reply was, "There are a thousand and one other things of vastly more importance that the Sabbath on my mind and I have no time to bother with such a subject."

Consistency! here is a man who thinks the Sunday is of such vast importance that he invites the American Sabbath Union to hold a rally in his church for the support of it, who himself spoke for ten minutes, showing his hearty sympathy with the cause, yet says that a thousand and one other things of vastly more importance than the Sabbath of God occupy his mind. A peculiar state of things truly.

The writer also had the pleasure of introducing himself to Dr. J. H. Knowles, general secretary of the Union. The following dialogue ensued:—

**Writer**—Dr. Knowles, what is the principal object of your society?

**Dr. Knowles**—The proper observance of the Sabbath.

**Writer**—The first thing then to know is which day is the Sabbath, is it not?

Dr. Knowles—Certainly.

Writer—One of the speakers tonight quoted Isa. 58: 13, 14 as the day to be kept holy. Is this the day to keep?

Dr. Knowles—Yes.

Writer—Does not God say the seventh day is the Sabbath? Why then do you quote this scripture and apply it to the first day?

Dr. Knowles—Oh, I know you—who you are. You follow us up wherever we go. You are well meaning and earnest, but you look only on one side of the question.

Writer—There is only one side to this question. We are to keep holy the Sabbath day, and God says the seventh day is the Sabbath.

Dr. Knowles—You only look on one side of the question.

Writer—How many sides are there to this question?

Dr. Knowles—What church do you belong to?

Writer—The Seventh-day Adventist.

Dr. Knowles—I knew it. Everywhere we go you follow us, we find your papers and other reading matter.

Writer—Dr. Knowles, I will ask you a plain question and I trust you will give me a plain answer. God in his word says the seventh day is the Sabbath; you say the first day of the week is the Sabbath, now who is right, who speaks the truth, you or God?

Dr. Knowles—You only look on one side of the question.

This is all that could be gotten from the doctor, so leaving a SENTINEL in his hand (the Christian Endeavor special) I bade him good-night.

I would say also that every person who attended the meeting, including speakers, save one who refused it, received a copy of that number of the SENTINEL.

Well may Rome say:—

"Thus sidle to the goal with awkward pace,
Halting on crutches of unequal size,
One leg by truth supported, one by lies,
Secure of nothing but to lose the race."
