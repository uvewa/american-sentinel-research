In view of all this that has certainly been done, it is remarkable how the great mass of the people of the United States do "accept the situation."

Practically, the whole religious element of the nation accepts the situation, because it is glad to have it so. This element not only accepts the situation, but will do all in its power to emphasize President Cleveland's pronunciamento that all "will have to accept" it.

The vast majority of those who are not confessedly of the religious element, tamely accept the situation because they do not believe that the issue is of sufficient importance to justify them in taking a course that will subject them to the sneers, the scoffs, and the ostracism both business and social, that are so largely dealt out to all who choose to let it be known that they do not accept the situation.

Looking at the situation as it really is to-day, in contrast with the situation that our fathers created when they established the National Government and fixed the supreme law, a person is driven to the supposition that the great mass of the people of the United States to-day must think that our fathers made a great mistake when they carried on such a long and earnest contest against any governmental recognition of the "Christian religion."

There is certainly a great mistake somewhere in the issue. If our fathers were right in establishing the Government and fixing the supreme law, with the express exclusion of any recognition of the Christian religion, then these men to-day cannot be right in dragging the whole Government into express recognition of the "Christian religion." And if these men are right to-day in giving express governmental recognition to the "Christian religion," then assuredly our fathers were wrong in expressly excluding the Christian religion from governmental recognition.

These two things cannot stand together. One of them must inevitably be wrong. And to "accept the situation" as it is to-day, and as the President of the United States says it "will have to" be accepted, is to say that our fathers were wrong in excluding the Christian religion from governmental recognition. But to say, or tacitly to admit, or "to accept the situation" which argues, that our fathers were wrong in this, is to go further back than that point. The leading writer of the history of the United States has well said that this exclusion of religion from governmental recognition was "the logical consequence of either of the two great distinguishing principles of the Reformation, as well of justification by faith alone as the equality of all believers."

To "accept the situation" then as it is to-day, is to allow that our fathers were wrong in creating the situation which they labored so hard to create. And to allow that they were wrong in this, is to argue that the Reformation, in its two great distinguishing principles, was wrong. And to do that is to occupy distinctly papal ground.

Nor yet is this all. We have shown that the situation which was created by our fathers in the total separation of the Christian religion from governmental recognition, is precisely the situation which the words of Christ declare that governments should occupy. And our fathers caused this Government to occupy that situation because of their respect for the words of Christ which demanded it; and because of deference to "the principles upon which the gospel was first propagated."

To "accept the situation" then as it is to-day in the Government of the United States respecting the "Christian religion," and which President Cleveland says "will have to" be accepted, is not only to allow that our fathers were wrong in excluding the Christian religion from governmental recognition, but it is also to argue that the principles upon which the gospel was first propagated, and even the very words of Christ, are wrong. And to do that, is to take the position of antichrist.

And that is the situation as it is to-day.
