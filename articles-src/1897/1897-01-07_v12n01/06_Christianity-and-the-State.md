"Of all the sages who have applied themselves to instruct men and to render them good and happy, Jesus Christ is the only one who has not considered them under any political relation, and who has, in no circumstance, mingled with his instructions principles relative to the legislation of empires. Whatever be the influence of the gospel on human morality, neither Jesus Christ nor his disciples ever caused it to be understood that the evangelical institution should enter into the constitutional laws of nations.

"The gospel is an entirely spiritual economy offered to mortals in so far as they have a destination ulterior to the ends of civil society, and above all, political relations: it is proposed to man as his second reason, as the supplement of his conscience, and not to society as a new subject of legislative measures. In short, the gospel has demanded, in appearing in the world, that men should receive it, and that governments should permit it.

"Such is the external character which distinguishes it in its origin from all the other religions, which had tyrannized over the earth; and it is this which ought to distinguish it, even to the end of time, from all those forms of worship which subsist only by their incorporation with the laws of empires."

So spoke Mirabeau, January 25, 1791: and though not a believer in Christianity, "if the great truths which he had caught sight of and proclaimed," when those who professed to believe them had disgraced them, "could not save France, they remained graven for posterity in his incomparable language. The day when we shall know how to comprehend and apply them, the faults of the first Revolution will be repaired."

"Napoleon said, in returning from Notre Dame after the ceremonies which had marked the conclusion of the Concordat: 'Now the French Revolution is finished.' . . . Not only was the French Revolution not finished, but it was even arrested in the track on which it had set out from its first day, and was in a manner fixed in its most fatal error. What was very decidedly finished was the regime of intolerance and persecution. Equality of worships, considered as a right, was gained forever; but with respect to true and sincere religious liberty, the Revolution was hardly commenced.

"Apart from a short and stormy period, in which the separation of Church and State had been proclaimed and realized with surprising success in the most difficult circumstances, the heavy hand of the civil power had not ceased for a single day to weigh on the religious conscience: and as it is there that we must seek the inmost spring of liberty, despotism had taken the surest guarantee against all moral independence. To persecution had succeeded imperious protection. The great corporations of the past had disappeared: there remained no longer any but individuals before the State; but individuals disarmed, to whom the right of association was strictly prohibited. Nothing was more easy for the civil power than to knead, at its pleasure, this fine dust; but this power was also soon to learn how frail are the edifices constructed with such materials. The true cement was wanting; for the cement is liberty, and before all, the first of liberties, that of souls.

"No, the Revolution was not finished in 1801. Nor is it finished at this day. Neither liberty in general, nor religious liberty in particular, has received a sufficient sanction. . . . Let it be thoroughly understood: we shall not have the free State except with the free Church—I mean fully free, without pay and without fetters, without emoluments and without organic laws, with the régime of the common right sincerely accepted. Thus will be secured against the invasions of monarchical or demagogical despotism, the inviolable asylum of religious liberty—mother of all others; and universal suffrage will be constrained to comprehend that for its tumultuous waves, as for the billows of the ocean, there is a voice to say: Thus far and no farther. The idol of false popular sovereignty will be broken.

"Such a reform will react on the whole political organization; it will reproduce itself in all its degrees, and will establish the true line of demarkation between the central civil power and individual liberty. Then the Church, under these normal conditions, living only by liberty, will find its first interest in serving and defending it. . . . The Divine idea can alone preserve liberty; but it is on the condition that liberty be not refused to the divine idea."

These weighty and eloquent lines by Dr. De Pressensé, though written twenty-eight years ago, and with special reference to France, are fully applicable to the condition of things in the United States to-day. Will the American people open their eyes to the evils that are being gradually fastened more and more upon them, and demand that the whole national system be set again upon the original basis where our fathers placed it in the final step which consummated the American Revolution?
