There are then, in fact, two situations before the people of America to-day: First, the situation which was created by our fathers, when, by the fundamental principles and the supreme law of the Government, and according to the words of Christ and the principles upon which the gospel was first propagated, they excluded the Christian religion from governmental recognition. Secondly, the situation which, in spite of the words of Christ and the principles upon which the gospel was first propagated; and in spite of the fundamental principles and the supreme law of the Government; has been created to-day by the repeated governmental recognition of the "Christian religion."

These are the two situations that are before the people of the United States to-day. The first is Christian: the second is antichristian. And "it is not a theory, but a condition, which confronts us." For the President has plainly said, and there are multitudes who are ready, by whatever means, to make the saying effective, that "all will have to accept the situation" as it has been created lately—the antichristian situation.

Calmly and deliberately, and in the fear of Christ, we say that we will not "have to" accept that situation. We will not "have to" do it, simply because we will not do it. Not only this, but we are going to oppose it with all our might—not on the field of carnage nor with weapons of carnal warfare; but as our fathers did, in the field of public opinion, with "the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God," "with sufferings and the Cross." There are thousands of us now, and there are going to be thousands upon thousands of us before the contest is over, who will not "accept the situation," who will not "face the music."

Christ or antichrist—that is the question. Choose ye. As for us and our house, we choose Christ, the principles upon which the gospel was first propagated, the two great distinguishing principles of the Reformation, the Declaration of Independence, and the Constitution of the United States. "Come with us and we will do thee good, for God has spoken good concerning Israel."
