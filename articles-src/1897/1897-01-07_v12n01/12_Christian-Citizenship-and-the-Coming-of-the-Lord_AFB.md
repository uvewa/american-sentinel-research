If elected by the majority will He serve? If the Lord Jesus Christ, "the Lord of Glory," should be elected by the majority of the people of the United States as ruler of the nation, will He accept the office?

There is a confederation of ecclesiastical forces engaged in a religio-political campaign with a view to electing the Saviour as Supreme Ruler of this nation. When this shall be accomplished it is proposed to carry the campaign to other nations until He shall be made undisputed Ruler of the world.

At this point some will deny that there is any such campaign in progress. Others will pass the matter by with the remark that if true it is the work of a few irresponsible fanatics. Others still, who favor the campaign, will readily admit the existence and strength of the movement, and will be ready for a discussion of the main question. These last ones are asked to wait until the existence and magnitude of the campaign are shown to those readers who are disposed to doubt or deny it.

The largest campaign procession yet organized to impress the public with the magnitude of the movement was the one which marched from the steps of the national capitol down Pennsylvania Avenue to the treasury building. This procession numbered fifty-thousand, and was composed of representatives of twenty-five Protestant churches federated under the name of the United Societies of Christian Endeavor, an organization numbering three millions. This magnificent parade was headed by a body of clergymen, one of whom carried a banner, an illustration of which is here reproduced from a photograph. This great demonstration was made in the interests of what is called Christian Citizenship. "Christian Endeavor Stands for Christian Citizenship," were the words used by the President of the United Societies of Christian Endeavor, Mr. Clark, when publicly presenting the banner to the clergyman who carried it at the head of the mammoth procession. The official report of this demonstration says of its ultimate aim:—

"That grand exhibition of young manhood and womanhood is the clearest omen yet seen of the coming time when Christ, whose right it is to reign, shall be supreme on Capitol Hill."—Official Report, Fifteenth International Christian Endeavor Convention, Washington, D. C., July 8–13, 1896.

A later and if possible more striking statement of the ultimate object of the Christian Citizen crusade is the following:—

"Not until the kingship of Jesus is established over our land and the world, and his teachings made the rule in all public affairs will the Christian Citizenship League have achieved its purpose to prepare the way of the Lord. And then it shall be found that not only has the way for his coming been prepared, but that He has indeed and in truth come."—The Christian Citizen (December, 1896), the official organ of the Christian Citizenship League.

Having shown that the object of the Christian Citizenship campaign is to make Christ the Ruler of the United States and then of the world, the next question that suggests itself is, What are the methods by which this is to be accomplished?

As its name signifies, this is not an organization of Christians designed to advance the kingdom of God (which is "righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost") in the hearts of men by the only methods known to that kingdom (by the Spirit and "the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God"); but is an organization of professed Christians formed to establish the kingdom of God by the exercise of the functions of earthly citizenship—political methods—through political parties, primaries, political conventions, platforms, candidates, campaigns, ballots, voters, challenges, contested elections, caucuses, fillibustering, laws, detectives, sheriffs, hangmen, etc. These are the methods by which the Christian Citizenship crusade purposes to make Christ the Ruler of the United States!

If thus nominated and elected will the Lord qualify? Will he accept the office, and reward the political Jameses and Johns, his most enthusiastic campaign workers, with the best offices on the right hand and the left in his newly established kingdom? Will he? "What think ye of Christ?"

Before this question is answered, the reader is asked to consider another phase of the subject. It is proposed by this movement to make "His teachings" "the rule in all public affairs." It is asserted that when this is accomplished Christ will come. By this it is seen that the doctrines of the Christian religion will become political issues, to be argued on the street corner and in the bar-room, and to be voted on by the believer and the unbeliever, the Catholic and the Protestant, the high and the low; and passed upon by judges and juries of varying creeds and characters.

Thus the kingdom of God which is declared to be a kingdom of righteousness and truth, and its law a spiritual law, and its sphere the hearts of men; is to be dragged into the sphere of politics, made subject to majorities, and handled with unconsecrated hands. Are these methods of advancing the kingdom of God in the hearts of men, Christian methods? Are they the methods Christ used? Would he accept the rulership in such a kingdom established by such methods? To ask the question is to answer it. But there is divine precedent and precept with which to answer the question.

About A. D. 32 there appeared in Judea the first Christian Citizenship League. Its object was the same as that of the modern league, to enthrone Christ. Of the Lord's attitude toward that league it is written, "When Jesus therefore perceived that they would take him by force to make him King, he departed again into a mountain himself alone." He fled from that "Christian citizenship" crowd, "a great multitude" too, preferring rather to be alone than be with those who so utterly misinterpreted the nature of his kingdom, and misread his character. And just as certain as Christ left those who would make him King of carnal men by carnal methods in A. D. 32, just so sure will he leave those in 1897 who seek thus to make him King. And just in proportion as these Christian Citizenship methods have been adopted, in that proportion has Christ already left the churches of to-day.

On a later occasion, when an apprehensive politician who had been informed by the Jewish Citizenship League that Christ wanted the politician's place, asked the Lord if the charge was true, He replied: "My kingdom is not of this world, if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews."

No, Christ's kingdom among men to-day is a spiritual kingdom, and its subjects are spiritual subjects who serve him in spirit and in truth. He seeketh such to serve him. But now in A. D. 1897, he will not, as in A. D. 33 he would not, be forced to take the position, secured by political methods, as King over carnal men.

Nevertheless, he will be this world's King. He will come in all His glory and establish His kingdom among men. For to this end was He born. But this will not be accomplished by any Christian Citizenship League, nor by any other political movement. When His kingdom of righteousness and truth has been established by the Holy Spirit in the hearts of all who will receive it, then He will come and destroy out of His kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity, purify the earth with fervent heat, "make all things new," and "reign for ever and ever."
