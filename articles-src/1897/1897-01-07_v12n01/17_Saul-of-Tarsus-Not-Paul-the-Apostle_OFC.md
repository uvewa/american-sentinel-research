"AND Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem." Acts 9:1–2.

This is Saul of Tarsus.

But Paul the Apostle had another spirit. As he himself was persecuted and stood before King Agrippa for his faith, we hear him give expression, through the Spirit of God, to these words: "I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having recived authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them. And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities." Acts 26:9–11.

What a wonderful confession is here made! that in doing all this evil work he was exceedingly mad. And all his efforts were seconded by the recognized heads of religion—the ministry. But after Jesus the Man of Calvary, spoke to him and he inquired, "Who art thou, Lord?" he is made acquainted with One he has never known before, although making high profession of religion. Now he is ready to repudiate the whole business and say it was "contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth."

The great lesson we can learn from this record is that those who engage in this kind of business, though they live in 1897, do not know Jesus, and therefore need to form his acquaintance at once that they may cease "being exceedingly mad." They need to get rid of that spirit, have their names changed, and have the Spirit of Jesus—the spirit of love. O that every professed follower of Jesus Christ would learn this important lesson and not count an unshallowed zeal as evidence of true Christianity.
