DECEMBER 17th Mr. A. M. Haswell, Secretary of the National Christian Citizenship League, delivered an address in Milwaukee on the subject of the relation between the working men and Sunday laws.

After stating that he should confine his remarks to the civil aspect of Sunday laws and their desecration, he expressed the idea that an implied contract exists between every citizen and the Government, by which the citizen agrees to keep the laws upon the statute books, and as the Sunday law is one of these laws, every one is in duty bound to keep it.

He indulged in quite an extended eulogy of the Puritans and their laws and said, "They met in the cabin of the Mayflower—God's modern ark of the covenant—and there framed the first Sunday law. Similar laws were made by the other colonies and have been adopted by the States."

"No one," said he, "favors the repeal of these righteous laws but blatant infidels, howling anarchists, and blind, greedy, grasping monopolies." He defined personal liberty as "the right to do as I please, so long as I trample on no one's rights, and no righteous law on the statute book."

After referring to the agitation of the Personal Liberty League for the repeal of the Sunday law now on the statute books of this State, he said: "Any one who under the sacred name of personal liberty seeks to have the Sunday law repealed is more worthy of the rope or the bullet than were Jefferson Davis and Benedict Arnold." This statement was applauded by the audience.

He declared that the only hope the workingman had of a day of rest was in having a law, enforcing a rest-day, and said: "Shall we repeal the Sunday law at the beck and cry of howlers who hate the sabbath and the sabbath's God? Never"!! In his estimation those who work for the repeal of the law are enemies of law and order.

Among the methods which he suggested for combating the opposers of Sunday laws, and especially those who were working for the repeal of the laws now in force, he mentioned the circulation of petitions by "the prettiest young ladies" who should secure the signatures of all the voters possible.

He also advised the members of the League to consolidate with every society, Protestant or Catholic, that is favorable to Sunday laws and that will work for them. The audience frequently applauded the speaker, and though the number present was not large, there was considerable enthusiasm manifested. A portion of Nehemiah 13 was read as a Scripture lesson at the beginning of the service, and it was manifest that many would like to "lay hands on" all who do not observe Sunday, even as Nehemiah threatened to lay hands upon the merchants and sellers of fish who desecrated the Sabbath of the Lord in his day.
