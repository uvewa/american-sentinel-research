To-day the AMERICAN SENTINEL enters upon its twelfth year's work. Every one who has watched the course of events during these eleven years, knows that the call for this work is more urgent than ever before.

When the first number of the AMERICAN SENTINEL was issued in January, 1886, who, however well informed, would have supposed that in only eleven years the movement to make the United States Government "Christian," and the "Christian religion" a national thing, would have become so all-pervading and so popular as it is?

Then there was but one small sect that was working to this bad end. That movement was weak, and unpopular almost everywhere. All the principles and precepts of the Government were positively against it.

Now the movement is powerful and popular almost everywhere. And in spite of principle and precept, the Government of the United States has been turned bodily in its favor, with notice from the National Executive that "all will have to accept the situation," and "face the music." In more than one way that is a complete revolution.
