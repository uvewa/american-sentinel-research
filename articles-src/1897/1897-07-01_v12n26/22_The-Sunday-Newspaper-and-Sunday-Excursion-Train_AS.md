A GREAT cry is raised by many of the clergy of the land against Sunday excursion trains and Sunday newspapers, holding them responsible as leading factors for much of the prevailing wickedness that exists at the present time.

A newspaper carefully conducted on the principles of civil usage is altogether proper as a promoter of intelligence and social freedom, and is therefore just as properly issued upon one day as another, except for religious reasons only. For the clergy to oppose it therefore, for supposed sabbath desecration, otherwise than by moral suasion, is to transcend the authority conferred upon them as ministers of the gospel by the Author of the Christian religion.

The same principle is true concerning the running of excursion trains, or any other trains, upon Sunday or any other day observed as the sabbath.

That church people themselves are largely responsible for the so-called sabbath desecration complained of, the following quotations indicate. In 1887, there was held in Elgin, Illinois, a Sunday law convention, many leading evangelists being present, at which the following resolution was passed:

"Resolved, That we look with shame and sorrow on the non-observance of the sabbath by many Christian people, in that the custom prevails with them of purchasing sabbath newspapers, engaging in and patronizing sabbath business and travel, and in many instances giving themselves to pleasure and self-indulgence, setting aside by neglect and indifference the great duties and privileges which God's day brings them."

"Dr. Knowles, the editor of the *Pearl of Days*, said that the Delaware and Lackawanna Railroad found that when their trains were not running on Sunday five hundred Christian ministers in New York City went and used competing lines, giving all their traffic to them. Then the directors said, if these other roads can get the patronage of the preachers on Sunday then what harm is there in our carrying other people on Sunday."—Battle Creek Daily Journal.

The following extract is from an article written by Rev. C. H. Zimmerman and published in the *Union Signal*, of Nov. 5, 1891, under the heading "So-called Christians Are the Offenders":

"A pamphlet before me with the above title alleges that moral and religious citizens are responsible for the inauguration of sabbath desecration by railroads. Railroad directors were unwilling to run Sunday trains when the petitions were first sent to them; but they were signed by church members and the directors at length yielded to the demand. These church trains developed an appetite for Sunday travel. If respectable, moral and religious persons could take an excursion to church, others could take excursions to the sea-shore. Though only a few local trains were at first run on Sunday, the public demand increased rapidly, until now they are running all over the land. Carroll D. Wright, then chief of the Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics of Labor, said in his official report: 'It can safely be asserted that all the facts, so far as ascertained, show that the inauguration and establishment of the Sunday-train system on the railroads which centre in Boston was wholly the work of church-going people, and that it was also for their convenience in going to special churches to which they had become attached. It was not called for, however, by any necessity in enabling them to attend the public worship of God.'

In this land of liberty, no person is obliged to do any work upon a Sunday newspaper, nor to sell, buy or read it; neither has he any right to forcibly restrain any one else from perfect freedom of choice in the matter. It is also an indefeasible right for any person to go where he pleases by a Sunday excursion train or any other so long as his conduct is strictly civil; and he is amenable to God alone as to how he spends the Sabbath, whether that day be the first, the seventh, or any other day of the week. It is altogether proper for a minister, or any other believer, to persuade men, even with earnest entreaty, to discontinue Sabbath-breaking, but they have no right to use the lash of the law nor the revengeful methods of a boycott to effect a reform.

Men and boys are largely confined in the dusty shops and factories of our towns every day, week in and week out, except on Sunday, while their wives and sisters toil in their hot kitchens or laundries, seldom getting a breath of heaven's air free from the grime and odors of the none too clean city. But the clergy, largely free from the discomforts of their parishoners, are, some of them, able to go to a lake-side or beautiful park, taking their families and servants with them, and spend weeks of the "heated term" in the enjoyment of the beauties of nature, forbidding the poor of their congregations, under proposed legal penalties, from availing themselves of the only feasible opportunity of enjoying like pleasure, because, forsooth, the Sunday excursion train is their only means to this end.

Every person has a right to keep Sunday as the sabbath if he chooses to do so and to persuade as many others as he can; but when an attempt is made to enforce it by civil law, the advocate will find himself arrayed on the side of the prince of darkness. When an appeal is made to the Bible to sustain Sunday sanctity, a Gibralter of divine authority will resist the attack, for God commands in his Word the sanctity, not of the first, but of the seventh day.
