This Association was organized to care for the families of those who were imprisoned for conscience' sake, and to disseminate the principles of religious liberty, especially by means of the printed page. The Association is supported by members who pay one dollar a year as a membership fee and by donations from those interested in its work.

Since its organization, multiplied millions of pages of literature have been distributed and thousands of dollars given in aid of the oppressed, but the signs of the times indicate that the heat of the battle is still ahead of us.

All members receive free, as fast as they are published, all issues of the *Religious Liberty Library*, a monthly publication with occasional extras, devoted to the discussion of current religious liberty questions.

July 1st is the date for sending letters to members of the Association asking for their annual offerings. These letters will cost nearly $125.00, a sum with which we could circulate half a million pages of tracts. Can not this sum be saved to the cause of truth by our friends sending in their dues and donations this year without waiting for our annual letter. We hereby kindly request that this be done. Those wishing to become members can do so on the payment of $1.00.

Address all communications to the International Religious Liberty Association, 39 Bond St., New York, N. Y. Write your name and address plainly, so that we can print it with our list of subscribers to the Library. Remember the Library is free to members. We sincerely hope that our friends will respond promptly and thus make the annual letter unnecessary.

A. F. BALLenger, Secretary.
