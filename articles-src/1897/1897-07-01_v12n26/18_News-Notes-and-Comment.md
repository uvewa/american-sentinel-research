When Mr. Justice Brewer delivered that famous opinion of the Supreme Court, under which a learned English divine was admitted into this country that he might assist at the ministrations of "Old Trinity Church" in New York City, the Justice felt called upon to work out, at considerable length, and with elaboration quite extensive, the items which he had taken it upon himself to "nail up and defend"—namely, "that this is a Christian nation." He approached his subject from various directions, and always with the same results. He shed upon it many different kinds of light, and the letters only came out all the stronger. The "X rays" of an intellect unquestionably forceful, were turned upon it, and the declaration showed, through and through without a flaw, "this is a Christian nation."

Now, whatever a layman may feel himself at liberty to do, it lies not within the province of an attorney to criticise the Supreme Court of the United States, or to question the utterances of that high judicial body—"the most august tribunal in the world," as it has been styled. And the methods, or line of reasoning whereby any given conclusion has been reached in the minds of the judges, is as much beyond the purview of the practitioner as is the decision itself. Nevertheless, there is no objection to pointing out that certain facts which the court cites, as pertinent to its view of the legal question involved in a particular case, have also a significance apart altogether from their relation to the issue argued and decided therein.

* * *

In the great "Christian nation case," for example, the Supreme Court's opinion, as delivered by Mr. Justice Brewer, calls attention to the fact that nearly every "commission" or royal authority given by European powers to their citizens, to make discoveries, plant settlements, or "stake out claims," in Western mining parlance, on this continent of ours, mentions, in terms more or less specific, as among the objects contemplated in the grant, "the propagation of the Christian faith among savages now living in darkness." This, it is considered, constitutes an argument in favor of the proposition that ours is "a Christian country." So be it. We have here, at any rate, a historical datum of other, if not wider significance.

* * *

With the single exception of the Dutch, every nation of Europe did, indeed, deem it advisable to proclaim to the world the missionary character of its expeditions to the American shores. (I have found one English "commission" from which this announcement was omitted, I presume by an oversight.) Trade is mentioned as a desirable thing to look out for; the extension of the control of Christian rulers over lands occupied by unbelievers is spoken of as quite desirable; but these are matters of a transitory world, and only a means to an end—the saving of immortal souls to an eternal life, where time and territory and trade shall be no more. In our day, when a nation goes to war, she does not feel called upon to justify herself in the eyes of her own people or of other communities by any pretense of religious zeal or aspiration. Columbus set out westward that he might reach the East and "convert the Great Khan." But England calmly takes India by the throat and chokes her into submission, without either thinking or talking about the Gospel, though, as a matter of course, behind the bayonets and the artillery, go the clergyman and the "Established Church." What is the cause of this difference?

* * *

It is all due to the change of zeitgeist, or time spirit. After the barbarians who overthrew Rome had parcelled the fair domain of Europe out—not to their satisfaction, for they were continually squabbling, and "rearranging and shifting," but still, after a fashion—among themselves, there was, for several centuries, a very remarkable zeitgeist dominating the minds of men. The Phenicians were the great traders of antiquity. The Greeks knew and appreciated the value of wealth, and the importance of barter for its acquisition. So did the Romans. These last accumulated worldly goods, at the height of their power and magnificence, largely by plunder; but they also had ships, and profited by the exchange of the products of one country for those of another. But after Rome's eagles had flown away, never to return, commerce practically ceased. The Barons enriched themselves by robbing each other from time to time. The peasants patiently tilled the soil; there was little inducement for any one of them to "go into business," for, if he succeeded, it was pretty certain that, sooner or later, some great "lord" would make a "forced loan" out of his accumulations.

* * *

A very amusing illustration of the popular attitude towards trade is given by Mr. Charles Reade in his great story, "The Cloister and the Hearth." and it shows a wonderful capacity for entering into the spirit of another age, totally different from that of our own, does the imagining of such an incident. Mr. Reade tells us of a German shoemaker of the period under consideration, who was discovered by a would-be customer sound asleep at the door of his shop, in the middle of the day. The man was quite angry at being disturbed, and his wrath was rather augmented than mollified, when he learned the purpose for which his visitor had called. He entered the store reluctantly, and begged the stranger not to buy a particular pair of shoes which attracted the latter's fancy. The customer, however, insisted on having what he wanted, and got it at last. As he left, the shoemaker dropped into his chair again, his face covered with tears, and sobbed himself back into slumber, grievously moaning, "my last pair of guilded shoes—my last pair of guilded shoes!" The genius of commerce was not the zeitgeist.

* * *

And as trade was no part of men's thoughts, to fight for it would have been considered quite as reprehensible as to live for it and work for it. Hence, wars, in order that they might be commended to the general approval, were always prosecuted under the guise and in the name of religion. There can be no doubt that the first crusade, at least, was quite sincerely organized through the influence of a religious feeling. But it was by no means so with the last. One must read "The Laws of Civilization and Decay," a most remarkable work, which has lately and deservedly passed into a second edition, in order to fully appreciate the sordid and mercenary motives by which that great expedition was governed, and the astounding atrocities to which it was driven by its controlling impulse of greed and covetousness. There were good, honest, straightforward men who left their homes and families, many of them forever, upon that fateful occasion; but they were few, comparatively, in numbers, and too poor to act alone; so they did the dirty work of the rest, and died at it.

The Crusaders had revealed to the new Europe which had arisen on the ruins of Rome's great Empire, the wondrous possibilities of the East. Here was seen an enormous extent of territory, exhibiting a wealth and luxury and magnificence beyond the dreams of mail-clad warriors, plodding peasant, and petty village merchant. While Europe had been busy sacking castles and settling the details of long theological creeds, Asia had for centuries chiefly concerned herself with making things as comfortable and enjoyable as possible in the present life. The most orthodox believers were impressed with the importance of this course when they saw it going on before their very eyes. Legends were many of a grandeur transcendant, almost ineffable, in regions beyond their seas. A glimpse they got into a wondrous charming new world; but Saracen obstinacy prevented more than a glimpse.

* * *

It was maddening. The dwellers in the far-off Fairy Land might be weaker than those who thus blocked the way. Perhaps their vast treasures of gold and silver and precious stones and gorgeous raiment might be easily taken from them by threats; or a very slight degree of violence might prove all that was necessary. Or they might be so savage and simple-minded that a few trinkets would purchase from them a quantity of things that had a real substantial value. Anyway, they must be gotten at, somehow or other. Of course, they were pagans. And, therefore, it was not only a right, but it was a Christian duty, if their hard-headedness rendered such a step necessary, to employ any force whatever, in order to dispossess them of those worldly blessings which it was not thinkable that they should have done anything to deserve at the hands of Providence.

* * *

They cannot be reached from the East? Very well, then; we must try the West? By this time, the idea of the rotundity of the earth was, if not generally accredited, and though even under the ban of the Infallible Church, by no means universally rejected. Obviously, if it were true, one could get to the East by the simple process of sailing westward. It was a tempting idea. By this means, the rude and implacable Saracen, who now asserted his unholy claims to land which he had conquered, would be outflanked, and approached from the rear. And between him and the adventurers would lie exposed a Paradise of richness and glory, such as the eye of Western man had never seen, nor his mind conceived.

* * *

But the zeitgeist was still largely religious, and only in part commercial. The last Crusade was entered upon under an express contract between its financial promoter, party of the first part, and its commanding officer, party of the second part, that a great act of spoliation and outrage should be perpetrated before any attempt was made to invade the soil of Palestine; nevertheless, like all of its predecessors it was commissioned in the name of the Father, and Son, and Spirit, and sent forth to do the will of Deity in the work of murder and rapine. And, just so, when it was finally determined to try the experiment of penetrating the eastern arena by a western route, it was deemed necessary to insist that no worldly motive lay at the bottom of the movement—that Christianity, and not avarice was the cause of it all.

* * *

When we thus contemplate the early expeditions to this hemisphere as the direct result of the Crusades; when we understand that, like the last crusade itself, they occurred at a time when men's minds were in a transition state—when the replacement of the zeitgeist of religion by the zeitgeist of acquisition was just about commencing—then we have at once the key to those expressions in the "commissions," etc., which are sometimes relied upon as evidences that "this is a Christian nation." They were just as inevitable, under the circumstances, in such instruments, as the similar language in the papal "Bulls" whereby the faithful were exhorted to go forth and expel the infidel from the blessed land of Palestine, the cradle of the Christian Church.

* * *

How far were the men of that time sincere in the use of such language? How far did its use impose upon governments, upon citizens, upon the world at large? No definite answer can be given to these questions, profoundly interesting as they are. But one thing is certain—there was an element of sincerity in those who used them, and to some extent there was a genuine belief in them on the part of those for whose benefit they were promulgated.

* * *

This historical review, while, as already observed, it is not presented with any idea of challenging the conclusion of our great Forum of last resort, to the effect that "this is a Christian nation," nevertheless has an important value in an altogether different question—and one of considerable importance. It is hard for us nowadays to appreciate the lofty degree of courage and manly indifference to danger which were required for the voyage of Columbus, and for the wonderful work of the Cabots. Men who ventured as they did, with the scanty knowledge that they possessed, in their frail crafts, without charts, and having compasses of the rudest kind, must have been driven by an impulse stronger than any mere idle curiosity "to see and hear some new thing." What was the secret of it all?

* * *

Incidentally, these men, and others of their ilk, may have made this land, nominally, as we have been told they did, "a Christian country." There is no denying that they were uniformly instructed to do so. But a close and impartial scrutiny of history shows that this thing was done, if at all, incidentally or accidentally. America was really discovered not because the people or potentates of Europe were desirous to "bring souls to Christ," but because people and potentates alike were full of the lust of covetousness, the "sacra auri fames," or "accursed thirst after gold," of the old Roman poet. Columbus was sent to convert the "Grand Khan." Then, as now, there were people "right around home" avowedly unconverted, and others whose conduct plainly showed that their professions of belief in the true faith were based on a misconception of their own mental condition. But the "Grand Khan" whom Columbus set out to Christianize was supposed to sit on a throne of solid gold, studded with diamonds and other precious gems, and his palace glittered with silver trappings, and pillars of alabaster, and chains of pearls, and in the vaults of his treasury lay millions of coin untold. And so, Columbus got his ships from Ferdinand and Isabella.

The wrath of man worked salvation. A mighty nation has grown up in the land that Cabot ran against when he was groping for a "northwest passage" to the treasure house of El-dorado. As great as any in many other regards, this nation stands unique in the family of commonwealths, as the representative of political ideas to which she owed her birth, and which are the foundation stones of her existence. One of those ideas—a very vital one—one of transcendent consequence—is the idea of a total separation of Church and State. How far this idea is consistent with her posing as "a Christian nation" is not the question here. The purpose of these present paragraphs is simply to point out the fact that, if those whose first coming hither made her life a possibility did anything to give her this characteristic, at least the doing of it was not the active cause of their coming—that, if the only hope and aim in life of those who fitted out and those who conducted the great voyages of discovery had been the propagation of the gospel and the glory of the Saviour, as they understood it, we should never have had a Columbus, a Cabot, a Smith or a Raleigh to tempt the waves, or a Bancroft to record their achievements.
