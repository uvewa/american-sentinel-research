The assessor of King County, Washington, in which the city of Seattle is situated, has announced that he will assess taxes on church property in that city. The authority under which he will attempt to carry out this innovation is a recent decision by the Supreme Court of the State, which annuls a legislative provision under which church property secured exemption. A Washington paper states the case as follows:—

"The constitution of the State does not exempt church property. It leaves a loophole for unjust exemptions, however, when it says: 'Provided, that the property of the United States, and of the States, counties, school districts, corporations (municipal), and such other property as the legislature may by general laws provide, shall be exempt from taxation.'

"Acting upon this clause in the constitution, the first legislature enacted a law by which personal property to the amount of $300 became exempt from taxation, along with church property, charitable institutions, and quasi-public property. Last winter the legislature increased this exemption on personal property to $500, and also exempted improvements on real estate to the extent of $500. This act was by the Supreme Court recently pronounced unconstitutional, together with the former act which permitted a $300 exemption on personal property.

"Now the $300 exemption proviso and the proviso to exempt church property are in the same clause, and are read in the same breath. There are many who contend that when the Supreme Court ruled against the clause providing for the $300 exemption on personal property it also knocked out the proviso for the exemption of church property."
