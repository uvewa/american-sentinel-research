An illustration of "religion in politics" was furnished at the opening of the Ohio State Republican convention, at Toledo, June 22. The incident calls out the following from the New York Journal of June 24:—

"The country clergyman who opened the proceedings of the Ohio Republican convention with a supplication to the Almighty on Tuesday had a rather singular idea of the ethics of prayer. However, he had a very correct estimate of the mental characteristics of a Republican convention, for it is recorded that at various points in his appeal the assembled delegates applauded wildly, and at the close they clambered upon their chairs and cheered themselves hoarse.

"Through the efforts of this suppliant, a Deity, supposed to be all-seeing and omniscient, was explicitly informed of the condition of affairs within the Republican party. Especially was he commended to keep an eye on a certain "typical American and father of the Republican party." . . .

"Continuing, the preacher begged the Almighty to take an active part in fastening the protective system on the United States. He seemed to recognize no impropriety in appealing to that Great Power which rules all the nations of the earth to aid this one people in its effort to discriminate against all others, and to cut off from our markets the workers of every other country. A device which is successful in proportion as it reduces the workers of other lands to want and misery is a curious thing to recommend to the God of all the nations, but Ohio's political preacher was equal to the occasion. The assembled Republicans shouted themselves hoarse when he lifted up his appeal:—

"May there be among our lawmakers such wisdom and patriotism and loyalty to American interests as shall mend the breach in the wall of our prosperity, and by protecting our industries give employment to labor, and thereby create a market at home and abroad, upon the pivot of which turns national prosperity."

"For years the prayers offered by political preachers in Congress, Legislatures and conventions have been a scandal to the godly and a cause for merriment among the impious. Of the egregious bad taste of such a performance as that at Toledo there can be no doubt. That all thought of the sacredness of the office the clergyman was filling was banished by the matter and the manner of his supplication was made evident by the fact that his auditors treated the prayer as they would a political stump speech, interrupting with applause whenever stirred by the speaker's sentiments. Such incidents only blunt the sentiment of reverence, yet they will be repeated as long as political preachers are called upon to open political gatherings with prayer. It would be better to omit the opening ceremonies, since the very class of pulpiteers least fit to discharge the duties of the office invariably seek it."
