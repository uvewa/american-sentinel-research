AN Omaha correspondent writes us the following concerning the plans of the Omaha Ministerial Association for securing Sunday closing of the "Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition," now in progress in that city:

"I attended the Omaha Ministerial Association to day [June 21]. The topic of discussion was the closing of the gates of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition on Sunday; or rather, the time was mostly taken up on this theme. The chairman said, We must be actively at work, or it wont be done; we must have a whole loaf if we can get it, but if not, we will demand a half loaf—the gates must be closed till after service hour Sunday morning. The president is the pastor of the Good Shepherd church here (Episcopalian). The Christian minister said, We must demand that the gates be closed all day Sunday or we will make the Exposition a failure. Others said, The disgrace of having the gates open on Sunday must not be, etc. The excitement ran almost to a white heat, and the gathering seemed more like a political caucus than a meeting of Christian men.

"A committee was appointed to visit the directors and ascertain what their mind is in the matter. Then when the ministers meet again, if the directors will not assure them that the gates will be closed, the committee are to present plans whereby the directors will be compelled to close up, or the preachers will see to it that the thing is a complete failure."
