"No man has a natural right to commit aggressions on the equal rights of another."

"The idea is quite unfounded that on entering into society we give up any natural right."

"OUR civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions, more than opinions in physics or geometry."

"OUR legislators are not sufficiently apprised of the rightful limit of their power; that their true office is to declare and enforce only our natural rights and duties, and to take none of them from us."

"The impious presumption of legislators and rulers, civil as well as ecclesiastical, who being themselves but fallible and uninspired men, have assumed domination over the faith of others, setting their own opinions and modes of thinking as only true and infallible, and as such endeavoring to impose them on others, hath established and maintained false religions over the greatest part of the world, and through all time."

"The spirit of the times may alter, will alter. Our rulers will become corrupt, our people careless. A single zealot may commence persecution and better men be his victims. It can never be too often repeated, that the time for fixing every essential right on a legal basis is while our rulers are honest, and ourselves united. From the conclusion of this war we shall be going down hill. It will not then be necessary to resort every moment to the people for support. They will be forgotten, therefore, and their rights disregarded. They will forget themselves, but in the sole faculty of making money, and will never think of uniting to effect a due respect for their rights. The shackles, therefore, which shall not be knocked off at the conclusion of this war, will remain on us long, will be made heavier and heavier, till our rights shall revive or expire in a convulsion."
