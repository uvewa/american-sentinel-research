THE following letter comes to us from a member of the Seventh-day Adventist denomination in Florida:

"Bartow, Fla., June 17, 1897.

"To the American Sentinel: One of our brethren, Thos. Furman, was fined to-day $5 and costs or 10 days' labor on the public streets, for 'disturbing the peace' last Sunday. The facts in the case are as follows:

"Last week I engaged Brother Furman to do some work for me, commencing Monday morning; and he found it necessary first to get up some wood for his wife. I sent my boy with a team to deliver the wood Sunday afternoon.

"The road runs within a few feet of the church building. There were two loads hauled. There were four witnesses at the trial, who all swore they were disturbed and that it was the first load that disturbed them. At the time of the disturbance the four witnesses were all engaged inside the house making a table to use in taking the sacrament.

"There was one wagon before and two behind the load of wood. Brother Furman asked one of the witnesses if any of the other wagons disturbed him. The mayor, who presided, told the witness he need not answer that question. Brother Furman himself was not in the wagon nor on that road, but took a near path some two hundred feet on the other side of the church.

"The complaint to the mayor was (as he told me afterwards) that this work was done on Sunday, but he said he advised them to bring in the complaint as above stated. The mayor was a swift witness in the case, no doubt having in view his fees; and after pronouncing the sentence, he told the prisoner, by way of advice, that he must in the future be more quiet on 'our Sunday.'

"The town ordinance says no work shall be done on Sunday except in case of necessity or charity. When the mayor was informed by the prisoner that this was a case of necessity, he said, 'Why did you not stop when you hauled one load?' I might mention here that only a few weeks ago the mayor's grown-up son painted a large water tank on Sunday in full view of the main street,— which of course was a work of necessity. He did not stop at painting one side only, but it was necessary to finish up the job. The mayor's name is H. P. Logan, and he is a lawyer by profession.

"It certainly seems to me that no man without God's sustaining grace could work ten days under a tropical sun to satisfy the charge of disturbing a religious meeting when there was no meeting going on at the time. Brother Furman is about 26 years old, and has a wife and three small children who are wholly dependent on him for support; and his only dependence is upon the work he can find to do by the day.

"Yours for truth,

"S. T. PAGE."
