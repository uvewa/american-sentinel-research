"Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath days," quotes the Michigan Christian Advocate, of June 19, in reply to a correspondent who wanted proof for Sunday observance; and on the same page the Advocate expends a column of severe invective against the people of Mt. Clemens, Mich., for being "profaners of the Lord's day." "Has Mt. Clemens gone mad?" exclaims the Advocate. Oh no, Mr. Advocate, we reply; Mt. Clemens has not gone mad; but they believe in letting no man judge them in respect of an holy day or of the Sabbath days, and have been conducting themselves accordingly.

The sabbath desecration against which the Advocate declaims consists in playing baseball on Sunday. A majority of the citizens of Mt. Clemens, it is said, are in favor of Sunday baseball; but, says the Advocate, "There is a good precept somewhere on record to 'follow not a multitude to do evil.'" But it may be that the Mt. Clemens people have fortified themselves with this argument which the Advocate gives on the same page in its reply to correspondent aforesaid: "The whole Christian world, except the Jews and a few Adventists, is observing the Lord's day Sabbath all right;" and "This big world was not fooled, as they would fain have us believe, away back in the early centuries." The Mt. Clemens people probably reason that if the example of the multitude constitutes a standard of right, it is all right for them to have Sunday baseball when the multitude want it; and they are doubtless aware that the vast majority in "this big world" do not believe in or practice the observance of "the Lord's day."

When religious journals put arguments in the mouths of the people which justify them in disregarding the Sabbath, such journals should be the last to condemn them for sabbath desecration. If the word of man is to prevail in the matter, then the practice must be governed by the principle of majority rule. But if the Word of God is to decide it, let there be an appeal to that Word and not to the customs of the majority. The Advocate well knows that the Word of God commands, "The seventh day [not the first] is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; it it thou shalt not do any work."
