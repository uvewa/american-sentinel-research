REPORT comes from Somerville, a suburb of Boston, that the Woman's Christian Temperance Union of the place intend to stop the sale of soda water at the drug stores on Sunday and the sale of goods from bake shops. Also, that the board of aldermen have forbidden Sunday sprinkling of the streets. Upon this an antichristian journal remarks: "These fanatics are determined to convince enlightened mankind of what many have already ventured to assert—that religion is a curse."
