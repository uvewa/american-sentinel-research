THE following words from a writer in the Truth Seeker, of June 26, present religious legislation in the character of a promoter of atheism:

"But what are we to think of a religion that purports to be of divine origin and claims divine indorsement and support in its perpetuity, and yet is obliged to appeal to the civil law for support and maintenance? For the Christian religion to appeal to the power of the civil law for support and protection is a tacit admission that God is impotent and incapable of perpetuating his religion on earth. It is also an admission that the devil is more powerful, and a hundred times more popular than God, for he never found it necessary, under any circumstances, to appeal to the law, or any other compulsory or restrictive measures to keep his soldiers in line and facilitate their advancement and strengthen their adhesion to his cause."
