The American Sentinel never has, and under its present management, never will, pose as a money-making enterprise. The sole object of its existence is to promulgate the principles for which it stands in defense, and never was it more determined in this than now. We may frankly say, however, that were it not for the loyalty and liberality of its friends it would not be on a paying basis to-day, for it is a well-known fact in newspaper circles that it is rarely the case that a paper is able to pay its way from its subscription receipts alone. The Sentinel now has a circulation that enables its influence to be felt, and requests have been made for advertising space. After due consideration the management has decided to open its columns to a limited amount of commercial advertising, taking great care to admit only such announcements as it can be assured are perfectly reliable, and which it can, if necessary, personally endorse in its editorial columns. We trust that this move may prove of mutual advantage to all concerned.
