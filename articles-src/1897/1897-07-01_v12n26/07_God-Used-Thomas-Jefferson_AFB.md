Those who oppose the doctrine of separation of Church and State, advocated by Jefferson and embodied in the Declaration of Independence and the Federal Constitution, attempt to make a point against the doctrine by declaring that Jefferson was an unbeliever.

This point has no force even if true, when we remember that God has used men according to his own word who did not know him, to accomplish his will. Isa. 45: 1-6. The Lord was compelled to do this because those who professed to know him were more ignorant of his will than those who did not profess to know him.

When Jefferson battled for separation of Church and State in Virginia, the influential religious teachers were so drunk with the "wine of Babylon"—with the adultrous doctrine that the Church should wed the State—that God was compelled to select a man whom the world-embracing church declared to be an infidel, to teach his truth to the nations. It is true that there were Baptists and Quakers and Presbyterians, who united with Jefferson in promulgating right principles of religious freedom, but they were all a dispised lot of dissenters.

Let no man glory in his shame by condemning the gospel principle of separation of Church and State because God was compelled to go outside of his professed church to find a man of influence with clear enough views of gospel truth to teach complete separation of Church and State.
