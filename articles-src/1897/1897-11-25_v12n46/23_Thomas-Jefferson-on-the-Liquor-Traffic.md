As is pointed out by the New York Voice, the platform of the party which in the late campaign in this city called itself the champion of the principles of Jeffersonian democracy, differed in one important feature at least from the platform of principles upon which Jefferson stood. It advocated the repeal of laws restricting the traffic in strong drink, in the name of personal liberty.

Jefferson's views upon the point of the necessity of steps to suppress this terrible blight upon society and the image of God in humanity, are expressed in a letter written in 1823 to his friend Gen. Samuel Smith. In this, after speaking of the tax on whisky, and saying that if it were to be viewed simply as a fiscal measure, he would be glad to see it fail, Jefferson proceeds to show that considerations of another and more important nature must be taken into account. He says:—

"But the prostration of body and mind which the cheapness of this liquor is spreading through the mass of our citizens, now calls the attention of the legislator on a very different principle. One of his important duties is as guardian of those who from causes susceptible of precise definition cannot take care of themselves. Such are infants, maniacs, gamblers, drunkards. The last, as much as the maniac, requires restrictive measures to save him from the fatal infatuation under which he is destroying his health, his morals, his family, and his usefulness to society. One powerful obstacle to his ruinous self-indulgence would be a price beyond his competence. As a sanitary measure, therefore, it becomes one of duty in the public guardians."
