CAPTAIN BARKER, of the U. S. battleship "Oregon," has communicated to the secretary of the navy a general denial of the story published a few months since by the Herald and Presbyter, and which was widely copied by other journals, in the form of a letter written by a minor officer on the "Oregon" to a "minister of unquestioned standing," giving an account of certain Romish practices observed on board the "Oregon" on Good Friday, and which, the letter states, were made obligatory upon the crew. The genuineness and truth of the letter seemed at the time of its publication to rest upon the best of authority; but the explicit denial of Captain Barker seems at least equally entitled to credence. We certainly hope the facts are just as the "Oregon's" captain states.

But the very fact that the letter was so widely credited and copied by other journals affords unmistakable evidence of the extent of Rome's actual encroachments into the sphere of civil authority. Had there been nothing in the nature of an alliance with the government heretofore, such a letter as the one in question would have been wholly discredited from the start.
