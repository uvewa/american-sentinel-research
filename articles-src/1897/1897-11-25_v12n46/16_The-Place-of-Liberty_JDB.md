*(Concluded.)*

LIBERTY is divine, and it is found in Christianity alone. Christ is the great Emancipator, for he was "sent to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound." "I am the way, the truth, and the life." "Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." In the language of Bancroft, "The voice in Judea was the first to vindicate religion for the conscience of the individual," and in vindicating individual liberty on that point, he vindicated it upon every point. He was the living expression of the one law in the universe, the observance of which insures liberty. This one law is the "royal law," "the perfect law of liberty," the only charter of equality. "I will walk at liberty, for I seek thy precepts."

Through Christ alone can the life be brought into conformity with that law, for "without me ye can do nothing." Therefore, Christianity is the place of liberty; the conservator of liberty; the only source of liberty; "If the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed." "Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free." Here no less than elsewhere "eternal vigilance is the price of liberty."

When I say that Christianity is the place of liberty, I do not mean that it is the place of a certain kind of liberty, or of a certain phase of liberty. It is the place of liberty in every respect, both spiritual and social. It is the place of all liberty, except the liberty of despotism.

Politics do not enter into it, yet it is a fact that without the principles of the Christian religion there can be no political liberty. The measure of freedom that has been enjoyed under any system of government has been exactly in proportion to the influence that these principles have had upon the lives of the individual citizens. Acting upon other principles, their imagined freedom has been made to minister to tyranny, their liberty serving the flesh only as a cloak of maliciousness. It does not alter the truth a particle to make the words of the Master read: Despotism is from beneath; liberty is from above; despotism is of this world; liberty is not of this world.

Nor do I mean that the spirit of democracy is foreign to Christianity. It is not, when it proclaims the equality of man and the principle of government by consent. In this sense Christ has been properly called the first true democrat. The Christian church, in which each member is obedient to the command of the Master, in humbleness of mind esteeming others better than himself, is the only true democracy that can exist. In it there is neither Greek nor Jew, Barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free, for "all are brethren." The first is last, and the greatest is servant. Vox populi, vox Dei,—the voice of the people is the voice of God,—was a favorite maxim in the republic of Rome. It is safe to say that there was never uttered a greater falsehood. In the Christian church, conducted upon its original principles, the voice of the people is the voice of God, for "whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."

A community such as would be produced if conducted upon these principles, is described by Longfellow in that beautiful picture of life in the village of Grand Pré:—

> "Thus dwelt together in love these simple Acadian farmers,—Dwelt in the love of God and of man. Alike were they free from Fear, that reigns with the tyrant, and envy, the vice of republics. Neither locks had they to their doors, nor bars to their windows; But their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of the owners: There the richest was poor, and the poorest lived in abundance."

It has always appeared to me that Longfellow was here describing the ideal rather than the actual; the ideal becomes the actual only in Christianity.

In conclusion, remember that love is the law of liberty. "Perfect love casteth out fear," "that reigns with the tyrant;" and "envy, the vice of republics," has no place, for "love suffereth long and is kind, love envieth not." This liberty is conferred not by might nor by power; not by the proclamation of consuls and the elevation of the eagle; but by the proclamation of the gospel and the quiet and peaceful influence of the Spirit. It is not found in the storm nor in the whirlwind; but is revealed by the still, small voice. It is my sincere desire that we shall so heed that voice that it may lead us into that soon coming kingdom, where the marks of despotism shall have no place,—where there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor pain, for "sorrow and sighing shall flee away, and everlasting joy shall be the portion of the redeemed."

> "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, THERE is liberty."
