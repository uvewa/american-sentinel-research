It seems to have been a very convenient thing for the German government that recently two German missionaries, while engaged in their calling in one of the provinces of China, were murdered by the subjects of that government. At any rate, Germany has proceeded to take "satisfaction" for the deed in a manner which strongly suggests this thought. She has sent a naval force to the coast province of Shantung and taken possession of the very important harbor in Kiaochou Bay, driving out the Chinese garrisons from the forts and hoisting over them the German flag. The harbor is said to be as desirable a one as could have been selected on the Chinese coast for permanent occupation.

Of course this act, which in itself amounts to a virtual declaration of war, is all right in this case; for is it not a maxim of the "Christian" nations of Europe that "might makes right"? Had it been a powerful government with which Germany had thus been brought to deal, it is entirely safe to say that her "satisfaction" would not have been taken in this peculiar way. As governments view things, the exchange of the lives of two missionaries for a valuable harbor on an important part of the Pacific coast of Asia, is a very profitable bargain indeed.
