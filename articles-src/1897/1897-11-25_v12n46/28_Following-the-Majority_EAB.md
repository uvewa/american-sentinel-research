"HELLO, Tom!"

"Hello!"

"Haven't you made up your mind yet to go to the circus along with the rest of us?"

"No, Will, I haven't!"

"Pshaw, Tom. I wouldn't be so foolish. Everybody is going, and for you, Harry, and Joe to hang back after we have planned to all go together seems shallow."

"I had nothing to do with any such plan, Will."

"Well, you might be a little more courteous and obliging than to spoil it all if you didn't."

"I dislike to be disobliging, Will; but to my mind circus-going is not the very best recreation, and I do not feel that I can afford to spend time and means upon that which will be to no profit. You remember our golden text last Sabbath was 'Why spend ye money for that which is not bread'? and I feel that this is just what I should be doing, were I to go the circus."

"It doesn't seem to me, Tom, that there is need of being quite so particular. I shouldn't wonder a bit if Harry and Joe would both go when they see that you three are the only ones standing out about it. Then you will be the only boy of the whole school refusing to go."

"I cannot help it, Will, if I am. If a thing is right, it is right, no matter how few there are who believe it; and with God's help I intend to stand for right even though I have to stand alone. The Bible means just such things as this when it says, 'Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil.'"

"Are you sure the Bible says that, Tom? You are always telling what the Bible says. Jim Drake said the other evening that he didn't believe half the texts you quoted were in the Bible at all."

"Look here, Will. I have a little pocket Bible right here with me. There now, you take it and turn to Exodus, twenty-third chapter, and the first clause of the second verse."

"I guess you had better find it, Tom. I don't study it enough to be able to find anything I want very readily."

"Well, here it is. Now read it for yourself, Will."

"Well, Jim says he thinks the majority ought to rule, and there is no use of two or three setting themselves up as patterns of principle."

"Never mind, Will, Jim Drake cannot be conscience for you and me. Read the text, please."

"There; that will do. You now know, Will, what God thinks of doing things because others, even the majority, do them. The majority has no weight with God, Will. Just let me find the eleventh chapter of Proverbs for you. Now read the twenty-first verse."

"'Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished.'"

"That is sufficient."

"But, Tom, Why do men dare to sin so many times when the Bible speaks so plainly about it?"

"Turn to Ecclesiastes (or I will do it for you), eighth chapter, and eleventh verse. Read please."

"'Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.'"

"Do you see the reason, Will?"

"Well, I should think it is plain enough."

"Now read the next two verses."

"'Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him: But it shall not be well with the wicked.'"

"Now we will turn to Ephesians the sixth chapter and seventh verse."

"'Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.'"

"Well, Mr. Drake told Jim the Bible wasn't intended for children, because they couldn't understand it; but from what we've read I should think it plain enough for anybody, and I can see now that you are in the right, and that right will finally win. I didn't know, Tom, that you carried a Bible right with you. I believe it's because you study that so much that it is easier for you to do right than the rest of us boys. I believe I'll use my circus money to get me a small one like that, and run over and tell Jim that I too am going to spend my time more profitably."

"May be you could persuade Jim to study along with you, Will."

"Perhaps I can, and who knows but ere long he will astonish his father with what a boy can understand of the Bible?"
