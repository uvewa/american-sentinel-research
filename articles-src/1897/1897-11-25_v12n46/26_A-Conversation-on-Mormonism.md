The Morristown (Tenn.) Gazette, of October 6, prints the following report of an interview between two Mormon elders who were visiting that place on a missionary tour, and a lady at whose house they had applied for entertainment. The conversation naturally touched upon some of the fallacies underlying the Mormon system:—

"Two Mormon elders were visitors in Morristown for several days last week, and harangued small crowds at night upon the streets. During their sojourn, among other families, they called upon a most estimable and Christian lady and asked to be entertained for the night. The entertainment they received is made public by the lady hostess in this report of—

A CONVERSATION BETWEEN TWO MORMON ELDERS AND A SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST.

"MORMON ELDERS.—'Good afternoon, madam.'

"SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST.—'Good afternoon. Will you walk in? Take seats.'

"(We will call the taller No. 1, and the shorter one No. 2.)

"M. E., No. 1.—'We are ministers of the gospel—Mormon elders. I presume you have heard something of the Mormon Church?'

"S. D. A.—'Indeed I have. I have lived in this world over half a century, and it seems to me that I have heard of them all my life. I know much of them from reading; and I had a brother in-law who went "sight-seeing" and took in Salt Lake City. I learned much from him. That was about twenty years ago, when Brigham Young, your prophet, flourished with twenty wives. I have the picture of the twentieth one on the wall of my chamber now, who went lecturing the world over against the horrors of the life she had been induced to lead.'

"M. E., No. 1.—'That was Ann Eliza. We do not practice polygamy now.'

"S. D. A.—'No, for the United States has enacted laws forbidding it. It is not a reformation of the church.'

"M. E., No. 2.—'I have been raised in Salt Lake City and I never knew but eight men to have a multiplicity of wives.'

"S. D. A.—'And that was eight too many. Quite enough to show that the church recognizes it as lawful in the sight of God, for which you certainly have no scripture.'

"M. E., No. 2.—'What does the Scripture say about seven women taking hold of one man, saying: "We will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel, only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach."

"S. D. A.—'And Isa. 4:1 is your foundation for polygamy? Read the connection and you will find that the Lord tells us through his servant there will come a great slaughter of men by war. There would be such a great devastation that there would scarcely be one man in seven left, where, as an average, God has created the sexes about equal. And for that cause the women would change the usual method in their depraved vanity and make their court to the men and propose to support themselves. Modesty, their greatest virtue, was forgotten, and with them the reproach of vice was nothing to the reproach of virginity. When a person's heart is in rebellion against the law of God, it is wonderful what a poor, weak foundation he can stand upon to justify himself in the indulgence of sin. I now understand why Mormon women are required to support themselves.

"We cannot take one verse of the Scripture and say this is the truth, the way, and the life, but must compare scripture with scripture. Had God created man with a nature requiring more than one wife, he would have created a multiplicity of them to begin with. The divine nature is contented and satisfied with one wife, but the carnal human nature is not satisfied with one wife or one husband nor anything else. It is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. You are Mormons because you have been raised Mormons; but if you are true servants of the Lord, you will, like Luther and the other reformers, break off from your church when you see she does not adhere to the Word of God, and denounce her errors and cling to the truth, no matter where it leads you. What day do you teach is the Sabbath?'

"M. E., No. 2.—'We teach the seventh day is the Sabbath.'

"S. D. A.—'I was not aware your church had made that reformation.'

"M. E., No. 2.—'We teach Sunday is the seventh day.'

"S. D. A.—'Well, dear me! So you break up the chronology of time to suit your teaching! Look at that calendar hanging on the wall before you. Does it not show that Sunday is the first day of the week? Don't all the world claim that it is the first day, and that they keep it for the Sabbath because Christ rose from the grave on that day? but without any command or authority for doing so, however. The seventh day is the Sabbath; and God has made it as emphatic as was possible to do in the fourth commandment. If I were you, I would cut loose from error; I would preach truth, which is easy to do when you have the power of the Holy Spirit to lead you by the Word of God, which is the sword of the Spirit which cuts away darkness and error. It is an uphill business to strive against God.'

"M. E., No. 1.—'Well, madam, we are traveling without scrip or purse, depending wholly upon the charity of the people for our support. We would be pleased to get entertainment overnight.'

"S. D. A.—'Were you teachers of truth I would gladly entertain you; but I cannot think of supporting you in leading the people in rebellion against God's law.'

"M. E., No. 1.—'Well, then, as it is getting late, we must be seeking entertainment elsewhere. We will bid you good-bye.'

"S. D. A.—'Good-bye.'"
