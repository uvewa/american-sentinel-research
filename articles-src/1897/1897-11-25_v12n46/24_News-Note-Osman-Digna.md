The accuracy of the modern newspaper report is pretty well illustrated by the remarkable (newspaper) career of that well known leader of Islam, Osman Digna. The New York Tribune has reckoned up the incidents of this career, as told by the newspapers, and finds that he was killed in battle ninety-seven times and murdered forty-eight times, that he committed suicide eleven times, and has been otherwise put off the earth twenty-three times; making a total of 179 fatalities for this one individual. This is probably a few more than have befallen any other individual who has had the misfortune to become a central figure in modern newspaper journalism.
