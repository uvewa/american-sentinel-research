A NOTICEABLE feature of the situation which has arisen in the public schools of Boulder, Col., in connection with the enforcement of the "patriotic salute," is the refusal of some of the school children to participate in the exercise because contrary to the dictates of conscience. At least five children have been suspended from the Boulder schools as the result of this effort to inculcate "patriotism."

In two instances, we are informed, conscience asserted itself in the tender minds of the children in opposition to the commands of both teachers and parents. The innate iniquity of the thing is apparent even to the conscience of childhood.

In one case, upon refusal to participate in the salute, the teacher exclaimed, sharply, "Why do you not salute the flag? are you a traitor?" To which the youth replied: "No; I am not a traitor, but I understand that the flag is an emblem of liberty. Now, if you use it to compel a person to do a thing he does not consider to be right, it is no longer an emblem of liberty." Another, in reply to a like question from his teacher, said: "I am willing to salute the flag twenty times a day; but as to repeating the words of that salute, there is no power on earth that has any right to compel me to take that oath." These were good answers, and their force could not but be felt.

A clipping from the Daily Camera (Boulder), of November 9, which a friend has sent us, gives the views of one apologist for this new feature of the school exercises, and among them we note the following:

"No; a pagan or an infidel in this enlightened age, and in this country, should not and does not get the same consideration as a Christian."

This is certainly a frank expression, but it is not the sentiment which has been supposed to pervade the American system of government. Such expressions may be only straws, but they show which way the wind is beginning to blow.

As we have said elsewhere, we are not at all disposed to criticise the motives which lie back of the introduction of this "patriotic" feature of the school exercises. Let us have patriotism, and let us have reverence; but let it not be sought to inculcate these by measures which disregard sacred rights, and force children to leave the public schools in order to be true to the dictates of conscience. Such a system has its condemnation written upon its face.
