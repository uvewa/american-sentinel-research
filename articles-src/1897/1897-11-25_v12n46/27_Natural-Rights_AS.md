Dear youthful readers of the SENTINEL: Do you not know that God, the Creator, has given to each living thing that he has made, from man down to the lowest form of nature, certain rights of which they cannot lightly or cruelly be deprived without doing them an injustice that would displease the Lord?

God made the beasts, the birds, the fishes, and the insects, and designed that they all should be just as happy and contented as it was possible for them to be. Their lives are generally short, and every noble-hearted boy, or man, and the girls, too, will try to make them happy.

When I visit a family and see the domestic fowls gather round father, mother, or children when they go into the yard, I think that surely the family are kind-hearted toward each other; but when the fowls hasten away, or the cat and the dog act afraid at the approach of any one, my thought is, This is a disagreeable family and one which does not respect the natural rights of man or beast.

Do not disturb the nests of birds. God was not displeased when they built their nests even in his temple. See Ps. 74:3. Do not rob the little squirrel of his store of nuts, for God gave them to him for food, and he has laid them up for his winter supply. Surprise him by adding corn to his store. Be kind to the horse, the cow, and all animals. They may not understand your words, but your voice and manner will please them. When among domestic animals, let the girls especially sing if they can. Some animals are delighted with instrumental music.

You may speak of the dog, the cat, the pony, or the canary as your own, and they may be yours rather than the property of somebody else; but remember that they all belong to God first of all and all the time, and he only lends them to you as his servants. God says, "Every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thou, sand hills. I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine." Ps. 50:10,11.

See that the domestic fowls and animals under your care have comfortable houses and stalls, and that they are well fed. It is their God-given right, and it will make you more tender-hearted to respect it.

When you can do so, put out some grain for the wild fowls, too. Do not hunt the birds or animals, and kill them with gunshots. It is cruel, and never would have been had not sin entered our world, and never will be in the new earth.

O girls, do not sanction the killing of the beautiful birds by wearing their feathers—for which they were cruelly shot to death—in your hats. Please read Matt. 10:29, and shed a tear over the death of the little songster whom your vanity has caused to be slain.

The seeds of religious liberty, or of bigotry and oppression, are sown in the domestic circle and in the surroundings of home, to ripen into an abundant harvest in after years.

The details of life in the parlor, in the kitchen, in the yard, and in the barn, as well as in social neighborhood and school life, are all contributing to your education, and will make you noble men and women, respecting the rights of all in after years; or will make you the very opposite, a discouragement to yourselves, and disagreeable companions, neighbors, and citizens. Which condition will you choose for your destiny?
