When was the Sabbath made for man?
Answer the question ye who can.
Hear the universe all around
Answering now with terrific sound,
"When the heavens and the earth were finished, then
The Sabbath was made for the sons of men."

Why was the Sabbath made for man?
Had it a purpose? Was there a plan?
Hear the angels ten thousand sing,
"For a token that Christ is the Lord and King.
It was set apart as an outward sign
Of the rest of the soul in His love divine."

How was the Sabbath made for man?
Was it by blessing? Was it by ban?
"It was set apart by the blessing of Him
Who commands the worship of seraphim.
'Twas the day of His rest in the love divine,
That all through creation's works doth shine."

Who was He who this rest began?
That made a Sabbath of peace for man?
"It was God the Father and God the Son
Who rested in joy when the work was done,
And set the day of their rest apart
As a sign of the joy of God in the heart."

Who should keep holy the holy day?
"Those who rejoice in their God alway.
Those who believe in a God above
Who looks on his children in tender love;
Those who can keep it as day divine,
Of invisible grace an outward sign."

What would its keeping be to God,
If men enforced it beneath a rod?
And what to him if devoid of awe,
Men kept it because compelled by law?
Answer that question ye who can?
"An insult to heaven, a curse to man."

Then shall the rest be the rest God saith —
An outward sign of an inward faith?
A jewel that's chosen to deck the soul,
And not the chain of a forced control?
Master or workman, ye are free
To do the thing that God saith to thee.
