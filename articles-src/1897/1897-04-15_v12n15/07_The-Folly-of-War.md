The man to whom God granted to be the wisest of men said, "Wisdom is better than weapons of war." Is it that there are so few wise men among the nations that they put so great trust in navies, armaments, and battalions? If in proportion to their lack of wisdom men put trust in these things, how lamentably little wisdom there must be in the world at the present time. There never was a time in which men put greater confidence in "heavy battalions" than at the present. So, when at last these forces are put in motion, those who have trusted in them most will meet with bitterest reverses. It is not given to those who are, from the human point of view, the swift and strong, to win in the final contests.—Present Truth.

"God helps the heavy battalions," is a quotation which expresses the "faith" of the world's "Christian" nations, as manifested by their works.
