Liberty is defined to be "freedom, exemption; leave; license," etc. Religious liberty is leave or license to worship or not worship God or any other object we may choose, or to worship in any manner we may choose, so far as another is concerned.

To deprive men of this liberty to worship how, when, and what he may choose has caused all the religious wars and persecutions the world has ever seen.

The ground of all this opposition on the part of the persecutor has been that in his opinion the persecuted was violating a civil law. Therefore it is of the greatest importance that we know where to draw the line between religious freedom and civil obligation.

As God is the author of both these we are sure they do not conflict with each other. Religious liberty and civil duty never encroach upon each other if kept in the spheres in which God placed them. It is only when men unite religion and the State that there can be any conflict. Keep the Church and the State separate, and there never can be persecution for conscience' sake.

But the great question and one that has perplexed the minds of statesmen and civil rulers perhaps more than any other is, To what extent can the civil authorities control men without interfering with their religious freedom?

We believe that if we lay aside all bigotry and selfish desires to interfere with other people's business, the above question may be answered so that all may understand and comprehend its import.

Let us lay down a few plain propositions.

First: God has endowed every person with certain natural rights.

Second: These natural rights are inalienable.

Third: Man's inalienable rights are not subject to the control of civil government.

We will not stop here to define all the natural rights of man. Foremost among these is the right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience. All will concede this truth, except the tyrant, knave, or bigot.

The right to worship God as one may elect can never be taken from him. To take away this right would be to make man an irresponsible being. To do this, one would have to assume the responsibility of another's character and conduct and answer in the judgment for his sin. This is impossible; for God has said, "So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God." Rom. 14:12.

Neither can this right be transferred or delegated to another. The priest, the Church, or the State cannot save any individual. God will hold every person responsible for the exercise of his right to worship and thus form his own character.

As God has given every man the inalienable right to worship or not worship, if he chooses to worship Him, God alone has the right to prescribe the manner of his worship. God has never delegated to the Church or the State authority to say how an individual shall worship Him. Out of the assumption of such authority has arisen all the religious tyranny of the past. The State with the Church behind it as in pagan Rome, or the Church with the State at its back, as in papal Rome, formulated into a creed, certain religious rites and ceremonies, and then demanded obedience to the creed or the life of the offender. Rivers of blood flowed as the result.

If God has revealed to each individual His commandments and ordinances by which he shall worship Him, then each individual can obey these commandments and ordinances to the utmost of his ability without interfering in the least with the same right in every other individual.

If I, in conducting my worship, interfere in the least with another in his worship, I am not exercising my natural rights but assumed rights. And just as I infringe upon the rights of another, I am not complying with God's requirements or the conditions of salvation, but am acting upon my own, or some other man's dictation. And it is impossible for one to obey man's conditions of salvation without trampling upon the rights of another. On the other hand, when we obey God's conditions of salvation, it is equally impossible to infringe upon the natural rights of another.

These last propositions may not, at first sight, appear clear to the reader. But a little reflection will enable him to see the truthfulness of these statements.

If you lay down laws and ordinances as conditions of salvation, and I worship by the use of these laws and ordinances, am I not encouraging you in the perversion of your God-given rights and aiding you in degrading those rights to purposes of self-exaltation? What greater injury can I do an individual than to put him in the place of God, by giving him the honor due alone to God? We cannot conceive of a greater injury that we could possibly do to a poor mortal than this.

It is exactly the same with governments. They are made up of individuals, and governors are only chosen to carry out the will of the people. Therefore if I acknowledge the right of the Government to make laws for the formation of religious character, am I not putting the Government in the place of God and worshiping the creature more than the Creator? and in so doing am I not aiding and abetting the people in degrading their God-given rights to the vilest of iniquity, besides offering the greatest insult to the God of the universe? Therefore we repeat that it is impossible to worship according to man's dictums of religion without trampling upon his natural rights.

But, on the other hand, if we worship God according to the conditions He has prescribed, it is impossible to interfere in any way with the natural God-given rights of another.
