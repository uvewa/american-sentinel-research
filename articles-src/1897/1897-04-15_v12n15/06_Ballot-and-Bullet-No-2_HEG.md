As the question of citizenship is being discussed so generally in regard to the responsibility of its exercise and its important bearing upon the most vital issues of the day, it is well for us to look into the real elements which constitute citizenship with its obligations and duties.

Let us call a pause in the zealous rush for recognition, and ask the question, "Who is a citizen?" as to the use of the ballot, and, What is involved in this citizenship?

"Citizen. In its modern use, the term citizen is applied in Great Britain to a dweller in a town, and this either in the general sense of an inhabitant or in the narrower and stricter sense of one who enjoys its privileges and franchises. In France it denotes any one who is born in the country or naturalized in it; and in America it is used in the same sense."—Library of Universal Knowledge, Vol. 4, p. 16.

Here are defined two distinct applications of the term, and a third is intimated. First, a citizen is a resident aside from, and in the absence of, the political rights of franchise. This is the sense in which Paul used the term citizen, when it was insinuated that he was an Egyptian. He said, "I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia; a citizen of no mean city."

Secondly—The sense indicated by the expression, "born in the country or naturalized in it," is that all people born in a country are citizens by birthright: whether granted the privileges and franchises or not, and it includes all of both sexes and all classes. This idea of citizens by nativity can never be set aside even by naturalization in another country. In this sense Paul used the fact of his birthright under the Roman authority in Acts 22:25–28.

Thirdly—The sense which is much more narrow than the preceding two, as it applies only to those who exercise the right of franchise, has a political significance.

It might be well to quote again to show the origin and meaning of the term citizen in this third sense or use.

"Aristotle defines a citizen [who exercises the right of franchise which is signified by voting in this country] to be one to whom belongs the right of taking part both in the deliberative or legislative, and the judicial, proceedings of the community of which he is a member. A citizen therefore can exist only in a free state. Between a citizen and a subject there is this distinction, that whilst the latter merely is governed the former also governs; and thus, though every citizen is a subject, many subjects are not citizens.—Library of Universal Knowledge, Vol. 7, p. 16.

Here we find a plain distinction between citizen and subject. In this sense only those are citizens who exercise the right of franchise, or the right to vote and hold office. The first two senses of residence and nativity, or the place where we live and the country in which we were born, belong alike to every person who has a home or place to live. This application is well nigh universal, while the limited use of the term citizen includes only those who exercise authority to govern. After taking out those who govern all the rest are but subjects.

As the Government of the United States is by the people through their representatives, it holds that every one who exercises the right of franchise is represented in all the legitimate functions of the Government.

Therefore, as governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, the power of the government is simply the sum of the power of the several people who constitute the governing element, or those exercising the right to vote.

This power being first in the single individual and delegated to a general fund by the acceptance of the rights of franchise and by assuming all its duties and obligations, each voter must equally bear the responsibility for the acts of government.
