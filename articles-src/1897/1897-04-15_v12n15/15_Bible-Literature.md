There is a world of vital truth in the following from the New York Observer:—

"There is such a thing as the Bible becoming lost in its own literature. In these days of many books about the Bible close and constant study of the Scriptures themselves cannot be too earnestly urged. No lesson leaves, for example, are 'helps' that divert from the scrutiny and memorization of the simple Word. The Bible is not the only, but it is the best commentary on itself."
