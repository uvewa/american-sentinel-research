THE clergy and "Sabbath societies" of the State of New York are up in arms over a bill introduced in the legislature calculated to produce an increase of Sunday labor. It gives to the Chief of Police in the cities power to issue permits to employers for the running of their places of business on Sunday, provided the work done be work of necessity. The authority to decide in an instance of Sunday work whether it was of necessity or not, seems to reside now in the "walking delegate" of the federations of labor.

In this connection it is pertinent to inquire by what rule "works of necessity" on Sunday are to be distinguished from other works? If there is no rule of practical value, it must be admitted that Sunday laws ought to be considered void on the ground of indefiniteness.
