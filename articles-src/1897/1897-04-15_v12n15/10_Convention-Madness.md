Of a verity, this age of ours is organization- and convention-mad. Nothing can be done without a convention. If a man wants to spell differently from nearly everybody else, he hunts up a lot of spirits worse than himself in this regard, and straightway we have a "spelling-reform convention." If somebody makes up his mind to endeavor to be a Christian, he puts forth a public announcement of the fact, and we wake up in the morning to find a "Christian Endeavor Convention" in session. When the exceeding wickedness of Sunday baseball suddenly dawns on a hitherto placid mind, a "Law and Order League" meets and organizes without more ado. A young fellow is shocked at the information that some of his acquaintances are not as good as they should be, let us say, and a "White Ribbon League" is born instanter of his teeming brain. A parent is perhaps smitten with the consciousness of neglected duty towards her children, and the only way she can think of to atone for her default is to start a "movement" for "a Congress of Mothers" at Washington city. After some earnest soul reaches the settled conviction that strings are preferable to buttons for fastening one's shoes, or vice versa, beyond a doubt we shall read a stirring call for all who believe in strings, or all who believe in buttons, as the case may be, to assemble in mass-meeting, and organize, and advocate an amendment to the Federal Constitution to meet the exigencies of the "reform."

The latest and most amusing manifestation of the convention madness (mania conveniensis, in the language of alienism) is the proposition for a mass-meeting of "good people," in order to form a "Good Citizenship League," with branches all over the country, and witha mission to "purify" and "elevate" our politics everywhere, national, State, and municipal. The practical difficulties in the way of this new "movement" are fully as great as those which bar the road to success against all similar enterprises—indeed, there are more "discrepancies" about its proposed work than there are about that of any of its prototypes. The first question is, of course, how are these "good people" to be selected who are to represent all other "good people" in the proposed organizing conventions? Are the delegates to be chosen by local conventions composed exclusively of "good people," or are certain "good people" in each locality to elect themselves as delegates, and appear with no credentials but their virtue? When the great convention assembles, who is to determine whether each delegate is duly accredited and entitled to a seat and a vote during the deliberations, or otherwise? Suppose some resolution or declaration of principles is brought forward, and two gentlemen differ radically regarding its merits—are they both "good people," or is one of them proven to be good and the other bad by the disagreement? When the final vote on the "platform" is taken, is the will of the majority to be understood as embodying all true goodness, and must the minority acquiesce therein, and govern themselves accordingly, under penalty of being cast into outer darkness, beyond the pale of good citizenship?

The fact is that this "call" for a "Good Citizenship League," is only more palpably ridiculous and vain than like efforts to do the work of goodness by meetings and organizations; it is, at bottom, not one whit more unsound in its impelling principle than the rest of them. One and all, these "movements" are based on a false conception of the nature of righteousness, and of the one and only means of its attainment. Righteousness consists in doing right; not in assembling together to talk about it; not in "organizing" for the purpose of centralizing force in order to have others compelled to do it; not in appointing "committees" on this thing or that; not in the fuss and feathers of "Departments of Reform." The doing of all these things, whereunto the much abused monosyllable "work" is so fondly applied, is not righteousness. Nay, even the real object of them all is not doing right ourselves, but having others made to do what we think right. Grant that persuasion is sometimes contemplated, as well as force, the folly of the whole business is none the less, for men were never yet purified or elevated in the mass either by persuasion or force.

This is to say nothing against the gratification of that great and fundamental demand of every human soul that feels the contact of another world—the assembling together at certain seasons to pray and praise. Nor is it to decry the wholesome, cheering, comforting or warming sermons of clergymen whom we know and love, and are spiritually helped by hearing. All these things address themselves to the individual soul. They answer to its needs. And the Church, being an organization, must have stated meetings of its officers to direct its affairs harmoniously—but this is the only purpose for which such meetings may legitimately be held.

It has been said that persuasion is a method sometimes adopted by the innumerable "Societies for Setting Others Straight" with which our country is at present infested. It is plain enough that this cannot be their main object. Indeed, it can never be more than a mere incident. For organizations and officers and "departments" have nothing to do with persuasion, nor has persuasion anything to do with them. The only conceivable purpose for which organization can be adopted and carried on is the concentration and application of force. Thus political parties organize—why? Simply because their object is the guidance of legislation along certain lines, the passage and enforcement of certain laws—in other words, their purpose is to bring the will of the minority into subjection to the will of the majority, and to keep it there by the exercise of the "police power." It is nothing to the purpose that they seek first by persuasion to win the majority to their side. Their vital and essential object remains the same. The very origin of their being, the sole reason for their existence is still, in the ultimate analysis, the exertion of force to constrain people to a certain behavior, irrespective of individual belief or desire.

All "Societies for Setting Others Straight" are political organizations, and nothing more or less. Their conventions are party conventions. Their true object is to influence legislation, and so to use the force of the community to make others go their way. The "Cigarette Department" of the W. C. T. U. is not established to persuade men to give up the use of tobacco in a certain form; it is established in order to secure the passage of anti-cigarette laws. The "Department of Sunday Observance" is not established for the purpose of persuading men to be idle or go to church on Sunday, but for the purpose of looking after the passage and enforcement of Sunday laws; and so on. In every city, town and hamlet, the members of these societies may use the persuasion of gracious words, the far better and more effective persuasion of clean, honest, upright lives, over all with whom they may come in contact. For this they need no monster conventions, no reports of committees, no speech-making, no platform, no "pointing with pride," or "viewing with alarm." But they must come together in great masses, and have their chatter printed by the column in the great dailies, and they must hold elections, and caucus, and report and amend and recommit with instructions, and all the rest of it, if they are to impress legislatures, and "the powers that be," and aspiring candidates for office with a wholesome respect for their opinions, and a reluctance to antagonize them on questions of public administration. And so, they produce "a platform," and show a strength of numbers behind it. And this political party work, they call "Reform."
