The magistrate in Essex Market Police Court, New York City, was surprised on Monday morning, April 5, by a great increase in the number of persons brought before him for violation of the Sunday law. From a single police station which records only a daily average of ten arrests for all causes, there were brought to his court on that Monday morning no less than twenty-four individuals charged with having done works not of necessity or charity the previous day.

"Why are there so many petty cases of Sunday law violation?" asked the magistrate, in a tone which evinced disapproval. The reply of the policeman was that the police force had been moved to strict enforcement of the law by complaints sent to headquarters by one Malcolm R. Burney, Chairman of a Christian Endeavor Society, at No. 280 Rivington Street.

"Wearily," says the press report, "the magistrate went through the long docket, and, evidently dissatisfied with his position, imposed fines upon such persons as were proved to have been illegally employed on Sunday."

And, we may suppose, the chairman and others of the society at 280 Rivington Street, read with much satisfaction the news of the rapid spread of Christianity through the agency of the policeman's club.

Meanwhile the victims of the Sunday statute must have wondered what meaning of the term Christianity would justify giving to such work the name "Christian endeavor."
