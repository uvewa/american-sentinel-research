"The tyranny of Trusts," says a New York journal, "is the most popular of texts; but there is occasionally some tyranny on the other side. For example, a well-known Trust which is building new offices has just received notice from a 'walking delegate' that it must buy the lumber needed in New York City. If it contracts for it outside of this city every man at work on the building will go on a strike."

But the "other side" simply represents another species of the Trust.
