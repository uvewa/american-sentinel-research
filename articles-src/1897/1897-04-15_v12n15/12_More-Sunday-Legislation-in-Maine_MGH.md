SUNDAY legislation seems to be the order of the day. Such work is, or has been, going on in every direction during the winter, Maine not excepted, notwithstanding she prides herself on her liberality, and boasts of her constitution, which guarantees to every man the right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience.

Four years ago a bill was presented to the legislature early in its session asking that laws be enacted which would prohibit Sunday excursions by railroad companies and steamboats, and properly regulate Sunday traffic, hoping thereby to return to the typical New England observance of the Lord's day. The bill was referred to the Committee on Legal Affairs, before which a hearing was granted. Ministers of the various denominations were well represented and pleaded earnestly in behalf of the bill, claiming that it was the poor laboring man they were wanting to see protected, but the principal speaker in defense of the bill said in his closing remarks: "Give us a law to protect Sunday and the Church will do the rest." Doubtless if that bill had passed and become a law, many honest, conscientious people in the State of Maine would have learned long ere this, by sad experiences, just what "the rest" meant, and the evil that is behind the whole movement.

But the bill was defeated, just as every like bill should be. The committee voted unanimously to give the petitioners leave to withdraw, which meant death to the whole matter, at least so far as that bill was concerned. The action of the committee gave the petitioners such a set-back, that they denounced the legislature with pen and voice for so forgetting their position as to treat such a measure with laughter and ridicule. Even the press heralded far and wide that the Maine legislature laughed at a bill aiming to suppress violation of the sabbath. The bill four years ago received such a blow that it seems as though the Sunday agitators had not as yet wholly recovered from the shock they then received.

Another attempt was made this winter, not so bold as the former one however. The effort this time was not made directly by the ministers, but through lawyer L. T. Carleton, of Winthrop, Maine, Chairman of the Fish and Game Commissioners. Mr. Carleton drew up and presented to the House of Representatives, through a representative from Cornville, Maine, the following bill:

"Whoever on the Lord's day fires or discharges any rifle, shot-gun, revolver, pistol, or other fire-arm, except as an act of necessity, shall be punished by a fine of $10 and cost of prosecution for each offense."

The title of the bill was, "A better observance of the Lord's day."

A hearing on the bill was granted March 3 before the Committee on Legal Affairs; the bill was very mild in form, and on the surface seemed quite harmless. Mr. Carleton appeared before the committee in favor of the bill. He said that he had given the matter but little or no thought, hence knew but little or nothing about the subject. He further said that personally he had but little interest in the matter either one way or the other, but the people throughout the State of Maine were writing to him asking him to appear before the committee and plead in behalf of the measure, and he said that he was very much surprised on coming to Augusta, to find any opposition to so modest a request, asking for a law to be enacted to procure a better observance of the Lord's day. He claimed that it was not at all a religious document, and did not pretend to be one; it was simply a law to protect birds that he wanted; but whether Mr. Carleton was or was not interested in the measure, there is no doubt but that the same evil motive was behind, and under this movement that is behind all these Sunday agitations, notwithstanding it was presented under the pretense of procuring a law to protect birds instead of the poor, working man, although the bill said nothing about birds.

The writer appeared before the committee in opposition to the bill, on the ground that it was a religious measure, and if passed would tend to unite Church and State, and thus conflict with the right to worship God according to the dictates of one's own conscience, and with the right which the constitution of Maine so fully guarantees to every man. The following conversation took place:

"MR. HUFFMAN.—Mr. Chairman of the Committee, would it be in order for us to ask Mr. Carleton a few questions in regard to this Lord's day bill?

"CHAIRMAN.—Certainly; be free.

"MR. HUFFMAN.—Mr. Carleton, if I rightly understand the bill which you have presented, it is to procure if possible a law for the better observance of the Lord's day; am I correct?

"MR. CARLETON.—Yes, sir.

"MR. HUFFMAN.—Will you please tell the committee what Lord you are here to represent? I read in the Bible that there are many lords and many gods.

"MR. CARLETON.—I presume the one that is recognized on the statute books.

"MR. HUFFMAN.—Which one is that?

"MR. CARLETON.—I do not know.

"MR. HUFFMAN.—If you are here to represent the true God, the Creator, upholder, and ruler of the universe, then the seventh day is His Sabbath, and it constitutes a sign between Him and man that man may know that He is the Lord his God; and to know Him is life everlasting. If by the Lord's day you mean Sunday, then you have nothing more nor less than a heathen festival dedicated to the sun god.

"MR. HUFFMAN.—Elder, would you please loan me your Bible a moment?

"MR. HUFFMAN.—Certainly, my brother, I am glad you are coming to the Bible instead of the statute books to find out who is the true God; and I am sure, my friend, that you will have no difficulty in finding that Jehovah is God, if you will but employ the means which He has given by which He may be known; for we read, "hallow my Sabbaths, and they shall be a sign between Me and you, that you may know that I am the Lord your God." And eternal life is in knowing God, and he who cares to remember the seventh day Sabbath to keep it holy can know God. And if the gentleman becomes acquainted with the true God, he will never again appeal to human power to regulate the observance of the Lord's day, for nothing short of divine power is able to uphold and regulate a divine institution.

"LAWYER L. L. WALTON, a Member of the Committee. —Will the Elder permit me to ask a question?

"MR. HUFFMAN.—Certainly.

"MR. WALTON.—Do you think that it would be right to shoot birds on Sunday?

"MR. HUFFMAN.—Yes; if it were right the other six days in the week.

"MR. WALTON.—Do you think that it is right to dance on Sunday?

"MR. HUFFMAN.—I do not think it is right to dance any day in the week.

"MR. WALTON.—Would you favor a law to stop dancing on Sunday?

"MR. HUFFMAN.—If dancing is wrong and demoralizing, and interferes with the rights of others, then I would favor a law to stop it every day of the week.

"MR. WALTON.—Suppose you could not get a law to stop it every day of the week, would you favor a law to stop it on Sunday?

"MR. HUFFMAN.—I would not go at it in that way; why stop it any more on Sunday than Monday?

"MR. CARLETON.—When does the seventh-day Sabbath begin, and when does it end?

"MR. HUFFMAN.—It begins at sunset the sixth day and ends at sunset the seventh day.

"MR. CARLETON.—But as the earth turns round and the sun passes from place to place and goes down at night at different times at different places—as you follow around the earth in pursuit of the sun, when does the Sabbath—the Lord's day—begin?

"MR. HUFFMAN.—When does Sunday begin?

"MR. CARLETON.—Please answer my question.

"MR. HUFFMAN.—I don't follow the sun at all; I just wait for the sun to come round to me. I heed the exhortation of God, and remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy as it comes to me—as it does weekly.

"MR. HUFFMAN—Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Committee, it seems to us but a waste of time to discuss the question as to whether Sunday is or is not the Sabbath, or whether or not a definite day can be kept; but the vital question is, What ought our State legislature to do about it? Religious legislation is opposed to the constitution of our State, as well as to the natural right of every citizen of this our Commonwealth. What right has any legislature to meddle with religious matters anyway? Such things should be left where they belong—to the family and Church. What we want and what we need is a free Church and a free State. The union of Church and State has always worked to the utmost disadvantage. Christ said, when asked whether or not it was right to pay tribute to Caesar: "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's." Thus he separated Church and State, and is it not the duty of every legislature to keep them as far apart as Christ has separated them? Our representatives are elected by the people to attend to matters pertaining wholly to that which is civil and not to religion."

What is all this clamoring for a Sunday law for anyway, and that too under the pretense that it is the poor birds they would like to see protected from the wicked men who go gunning on the Lord's day, and kill all the insectivorous songsters that haunt the woods. We have now upon the Maine statute books law enough, if put in force, to stop shooting birds on Sunday. Here it is:—

"Sunday is a close time on which it is not lawful to hunt, kill or destroy game or birds of any kind, under the penalties imposed therefor during other close time."

Would it not be well for those who are laboring for a Sunday law to protect birds, as they claim, to see that the laws now upon our statute books are enforced before asking that more be enacted?

The committee voted to report the bill with an amendment that it should only apply to cities, towns and organized places, since the bill as originally drawn would prevent the firing of guns up in the backwoods of Maine. The bill, as it was reported back to the House, and passed the House, looked very much akin to Constantine's law issued in A. D. 321, which applied only to towns and cities.

The bill was killed in the Senate, Senator Stearns, of Aroostook moving to indefinitely postpone the measure. He said he did so out of respect to that large number of citizens who did not believe in cumbering the statute books with needless laws. It would, said he, give employment to a class of people who should not be encouraged. It would be a source of annoyance to honest people. The firing of a gun on Sunday is no more annoyance than the slamming of a door. If the bill means a better observance of the Lord's day, then we have enough laws on this subject. If it is to prohibit firing of guns, them make Sunday a close time on guns.

Thus another effort of those who are laboring so industriously for a Sunday law has failed. When they will make another like effort, is a question.
