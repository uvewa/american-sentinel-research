The "Christian Endeavor" and "Epworth League" forces of Worcester, Mass., have arisen to the rescue of the "New England Sabbath." Not by the power of the divine Word, however, do they propose to accomplish this object; not by lifting up Jesus Christ, as all true Christian endeavor is supposed to do; but by the power of the police force of the city of Worcester.

They have drawn up and forwarded to the chief of police of that city, the following petition:—

"To James M. Drennan, Chief of Police of the city of Worcester, Massachusetts—

"The undersigned individuals, members of the good citizenship committee of the Worcester local union of Christian Endeavor, having a membership of 2,500 members, hereby respectfully and earnestly represent to you: First, that the laws of this State (chap. 434, sec. 2, Acts of 1895, 'An Act to regulate the observance of the Lord's Day'), are in common repute so notoriously and habitually violated in our city by shopkeepers, druggists, newsdealers, tobacconists, and others as to convince us that this lawlessness, if allowed to continue, will imperil the morals of the youth, and also the moral standard of our city; and, second, therefore, we respectfully appeal for the enforcement of this law, and also to use your power as the chief executive of this department of the Worcester city government, by proclamation or otherwise, through the officers under your direction, to secure to us and our imperiled city, the protection to which these neglected laws entitle us as citizens of this city.

"(Signed) JOSEPH WILLIAM ALLEN,
WILLIAM E. OAKLEY,
HIRAM G. GEARY."

"The above petition was indorsed by a unanimous vote of the Worcester local union of Christian Endeavor and the Worcester Epworth league circuit, representing a total membership of 3,500 members, at a union meeting held in Park Congregational Church, on Monday evening, Feb. 8, 1897.

"(Attest) GEORGE E. COPELAND,
"Pres. Worcester local union of 'C. E.'
"BURTON C. PRIEST,
"Pres. Worcester circuit of Epworth leagues."

The section of the State Sunday law to which the petition refers, is as follows:—

"SECTION 2. Whoever on the Lord's day keeps open his shop, warehouse or workhouse, or does any manner of labor, business, or work, except works of necessity and charity, or takes part in any sport, game or play, or public diversion, except a concert of sacred music, or an entertainment given by a religious or charitable society, the proceeds of which, if any, are to be devoted exclusively to a charitable or religious purpose, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $50 for each offense; and the proprietor, manager or person in charge of such game, sport, play or public diversion, other than such concert of sacred music, or an entertainment given by a religious or charitable society, the proceeds of which, if any, are to be devoted exclusively to a charitable or religious purpose, shall be punished by fine not less than $50 and not exceeding $500 for each offense; but nothing in this section shall be held to prohibit the manufacture and distribution of steam, gas or electricity for illuminating purposes, heat or motive power, nor the distribution of water for fire or domestic purposes; nor the use of the telegraph or the telephone, nor the retail sale of drugs and medicines, nor articles ordered by the prescription of a physician, nor mechanical appliances used by physicians or surgeons, nor the letting of horses and carriages, nor the letting of yachts and boats, nor the running of steam ferry boats on established routes, or of street railway cars, nor the preparation, printing and publishing of newspapers, nor the sale and delivery of newspapers, nor the wholesale or retail sale and delivery of milk, nor the transportation of milk, nor the making of butter and cheese, nor the keeping of public bathhouses, nor the making or selling by bakers or their employees of bread or other food usually dealt in by them, before 10 o'clock in the morning, and between the hours of 4 o'clock and half-past 6 o'clock in the evening. Whoever conscientiously believes that the seventh day of the week ought to be observed as the Sabbath, and actually refrains from secular business and labor on that day, shall not be liable to the penalties of this section, for performing secular business and labor on the Lord's day, if he disturbs no other person.

It will be noticed that of the four classes of individuals specified in the petition as conspicuous violators of the law, two—druggists and newsdealers—are among those whose business the law permits. The explanation of this is not difficult. The object of the Endeavors is to stop Sunday desecration, of which open drug stores and news depots are, in their view, as real examples as any to be found. What the law may specify as permissible on Sunday is with them a minor consideration. Their object is not to enforce the law, as it is, but to stop Sunday business by means of the law: and they will have it amended or construed, if possible, to suit their purpose.

Zeal for Sunday is wont to clothe itself in the guise of zeal for law.

The Worcester Daily Telegram of the 13th ult., reports that Chief Drennan, of the Worcester police, has caused the petition and Sunday law to be published, with this notice to the citizens:—

**DEPARTMENT OF POLICE.**

Worcester, February 11.

The following petition has this day been received at these headquarters. An abstract of the same was published in the newspapers a few days ago, and I have already taken action on the same. Any inroads on the sacredness of the New England sabbath in violation of law cannot be permitted. Ignorance of the provisions of law is no justification for its violation; in order, however, that all may be familiar with the law regarding observance of the Lord's day, I have caused chapter 434 of the Acts of 1895 to be published in the daily papers.

**JAMES M. DRENNAN,**

Chief of Police.

It will be seen from this that Chief Drennan considers it to be the duty of the police to "guard the sacredness of the New England sabbath." He views the "sacredness" of that institution as being of a kind that can be guarded by the police. There will be "inroads" made upon it if certain kinds of business are allowed to proceed on that day. But these "inroads," according to the petition, have been going on for a long time already. Yet this notice is put forth on the assumption that its "sacredness" is still intact.

It is also assumed that the "New England Sabbath" is the "Lord's day." This of course is a theological question, and due allowance must be made for a police officer when he undertakes to handle such subjects. But it seems too bad that the Christian Endeavors should force city officials not appointed to office with any reference to their theological qualifications, to make a show of themselves in this direction.

To a reporter for the Telegram, the chairman of the "good citizenship committee," by whom the petition was drawn up, said: "We are waiting to see if Chief of Police Drennan does anything about the matter, and if not we will take up the cudgels and with the assistance of our attorney will bring cases into court ourselves."

And all this is done—ostensibly—in the name of Him who never invoked the civil arm or made use of earthly power to advance his cause. Would it not be well for those Christian Endeavors and Epworth Leaguers to become better acquainted with Jesus Christ?
