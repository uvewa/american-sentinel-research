*"Chicago Israelite," January 9, 1897.*

One of the funniest theological discoveries is reported in the *Chicago Tribune* (December 28) as coming from one S. W. Gamble, a reverend gentleman of the South Kansas Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. This gentleman discovered that the "Jewish Sabbath" was not Saturday, but was a changeable day and that "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy" never referred to Saturday. The gentleman did not notice that next to this commandment it is ordained, "six days shall thou labor and do all thy work, and the seventh day shall be the Sabbath to the Lord thy God;" hence it could not mean a changeable day. Then he admits that from the Exodus to the crucifixion the Jews did observe this self-same seventh-day Sabbath. There is some confusion of ideas in Mr. Gamble's mind, as indeed what Sabbath day was kept before the exode he cannot know, and that the Jews after the crucifixion always kept that very seventh-day Sabbath—there never was a difference of opinion among the Jews on this point, although they lived thousands of miles from one another, and for long centuries without intercommunication. The Falashees of Abyssinia and the Jews in the Rhenish cities and in Ratisbon, all claim to have been there respectively long before the crucifixion and yet they keep the same seventh day Sabbath as they did in Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, and Rome in the time of the Cesars, as you can see from the Latin classics.

According to the *Tribune* Mr. Gamble's argument runs thus:—

"The Sabbath of the Jews, from the Exodus until at least after the crucifixion, occurred on fixed dates—that is, on the fifteenth day of Abib, or Nisan, each year, because it commemorated their freedom from Egyptian slavery on that date. It occurred the same day of the week with the fifteenth day of Abib until the day of Pentecost. The week including Pentecost contained six work days and two Sabbaths. The six work days followed the day of Pentecost Sabbath, which would bring the next Sabbath after Pentecost on the next day of the week to what it had been preceding that time in the year, making a change of the Sabbath day at Pentecost to the next day in the week each year.

"The same law holds good in the count of the Sabbath years and the year of jubilee. Each jubilee period was a perfect cycle in itself. The last week of years in each jubilee period contained six work years and two Sabbath years."

If the reporter of the *Tribune* invented this argument, he is guilty of murder with intent, malice, and forethought; it is a wicked satire on good Mr. Gamble. If the said reporter pleads not guilty, then the fallacy and folly of this argument are suicidal to Mr. Gamble's theology. The Passover has no connection whatever with the weekly Sabbath, although like every other feast ordained by Moses it is called a Sabbath, or a "time of rest." In the second place, Pentecost being on the fifteenth day after the first of Passover, came at the beginning of the eighth week, and there can be no weekly Sabbath at the beginning of a week, as said in the Decalogue, —Six days thou shalt labor and the seventh day shall be Sabbath. No Mosaic law can go against the Decalogue.

Aside from all this, the Pentecost and the Passover have no connection whatever with the Sabbath. The year of release was every seventh year exactly as the Sabbath was every seventh day. The jubilee year was added to the seven times seven years to make the era year in round numbers of fifty in place of the century, as we count now. The whole argument of Mr. Gamble is a theological fiction *versus* historical fact, futile and worthless.
