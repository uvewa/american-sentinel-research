THE CITIZENS of Carson, Nevada, are reported to be so well pleased with the partial revival of business and increased circulation of money that have followed the arrival in their midst of the two noted "heroes" of the prize ring, that all opposition among them to the coming "battle," has died out, and it even has the indorsement of the local clergy. In this we have an illustration of the fact that it is not morality, but money, that controls affairs in this world; and the men who control the monetary situation of the world, as it is to-day, are more responsible than any others for its wickedness and crime.
