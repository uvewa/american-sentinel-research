The following from a prominent Catholic journal of Philadelphia is very significant:—

"An encouraging sign of the times is the way in which the historians who have been most popular with the great masses of the people in this country are being written out of favor in the secular press. Apropos of the death of Joel T. Headley, not only is he classed in the American school of romantic historians, but Irving, Prescott and Abbott are classed with him. And may they and all who have given an anti-Catholic bias to their works have no successors!"
