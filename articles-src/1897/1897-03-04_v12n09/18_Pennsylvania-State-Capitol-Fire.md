THE PENNSYLVANIA State Sabbath Observance Association, recently in session at Pittsburg, did not let slip the occasion to point to the destruction of the State Capitol by fire as a manifest judgment of God upon the State for "Sabbath breaking." At least, as expressed by the editor of the Christian Statesman, it looked much as if such were the significance of the occurrence. Inasmuch, however, as Pennsylvania has more stringent Sunday laws, and enforces them more rigorously than almost any other State, the query cannot well be avoided, why she should be singled out from her more wicked sister States as the mark of divine retribution. If the event carries any such significance, it may well be that the judgment came on account of the antichristian attitude of the State which finds expression in the enactment and enforcing of her Sunday statutes.
