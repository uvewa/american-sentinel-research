In a letter to the Golden Rule for January 28, Rev. W. F. Crafts, one of the foremost champions of Sunday laws, objects to the idea that Christians might be "compelled to work on the Sabbath," and says that "when Christians count it a sufficient excuse for not doing right that it would cost something, and a sufficient reason for doing wrong that it will pay, we cannot expect victories."

True; and that is just the reason the cause of Christianity cannot be advanced by legislation. "We cannot expect victories" so long as "Christians" have not principle enough to do what they believe to be right, without having laws to make it easy for them to do so. Mr. Crafts adds:—

"But it would seem that in our day God does not intend that those who keep his day shall even suffer financial loss. I have searched the world over to find one who has lost by bravely refusing to do Sunday work. I have found many who gained, but only one case of serious loss, even from an earthly standpoint."

Well, then, what is the use of all this talk that is heard about the necessity of Sunday laws to give the poor workingman a chance to obey God? If he is not to suffer even financial loss by keeping Sunday as a matter of religious principle, what more can be asked for him? Why not let every Christian act from principle, and settle the question in that way? Is it not better that men should act from principle than from some selfish motive?

There is no possible reason why any Christian should want legislation on the subject of obedience to one of God's commands. Who is it that provides for him and for all men, whether living in obedience to God or not? Does he believe that it is God who does this? Then, if he believes this, can he not have faith enough in his God to believe that He who cared for him in his disobedience, will also care for him when he becomes obedient?

What is the standard of Christianity that is to be set up in this land? Is it that which says Christians must have the arm of the State to lean on in their journey to the celestial realm, and must have things made pleasant and convenient for them by civil enactments? The Seventh-day Adventists have pursued their way without the aid of any law in favor of the day they keep except the fourth commandment of the Decalogue. They have done this, and prospered, from the first, not only without such aid, but often in the face of legal opposition, and of all the inconvenience that can be caused by differing in belief and practice from the majority around them. They neither ask nor desire any aid from the civil power, but are entirely willing to do as they believe God commands, and leave the results with Him. Is not this the standard of Christianity that ought to be maintained?

Obedience to God from principle, simply as the result of faith in His Word, is Christianity. Anything less than this is not Christianity at all. Hence there can be no human law in favor of religion which is not contrary to Christianity. And therefore no such law ought ever to be enacted.
