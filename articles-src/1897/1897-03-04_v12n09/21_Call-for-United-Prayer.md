A "CALL for united prayer for the Lord's day" is to be issued by the Women's Christian Temperance Union and the "Sabbath Associations" in the different States, setting apart April 3–12 as a period of seeking "for a deeper love and a better observance of the Lord's day, and for the preservation of the civil laws by which its holy rest and quiet have been preserved in most parts of our country."

This call, in so far as it relates to "a deeper love and better observance of the Lord's day," is timely; especially in view of the fact that the members of these organizations are laboring under the impression that God's words "the seventh day is the Sabbath" mean that the first day is the Sabbath; that the day which God calls "My holy day" (Isa. 58:13) is the first day of the week; and that Jesus Christ, in affirming his Lordship of the Sabbath (Mark 2:28), answered the objections of the Pharisees by a reference to the first day of the week. We trust that during this designated season of prayer some of these individuals may become convinced that the Lord really means what He says.
