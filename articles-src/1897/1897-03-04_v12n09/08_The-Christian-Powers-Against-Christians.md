The great "Christian Powers" of Europe have furnished new evidence of their Christianity(?) by espousing the cause of the Turk against the "Christian" population of Crete. Upon this the New York World, of February 24, makes this comment:—

"When the ink is hardly dry on their formal protests against the unspeakable atrocities of the Turks in Armenia the Tory powers of Europe express their real opinions by bombarding the Cretan camp at Canea in the interest of Turkish barbarism.

"The Cretans have won their independence and have driven the barbarians who have oppressed them for two centuries to the protection of the guns of the men-of-war kept in the harbors to enforce the opinions of enlightened statesmen in London, Paris, Berlin and St. Petersburg.

"These gentlemen lately filled the newspapers of the world with expressions of their horror when men, women and children were tortured and massacred in Armenia because of devotion to their religion. We were told that their representatives in Constantinople were 'coercing the Sultan;' that he was in imminent danger of being driven out of Europe as a brigand, an outlaw, an enemy of the human race—as he is.

"Now when all this is put to the test, when a gallant people, refusing to be butchered as were the unfortunates of Armenia, have risen for their rights, have defeated the cowardly assassins who represent the Sultan's Armenian policy in its application to Crete, and have won for themselves the admiration and respect of the world, the allied powers of Europe, representing its intrenched Toryism, take the side of the Turk. They threaten to drown in the roar of their most Christian cannon the appeal which the Christian Greeks make to civilization against their Mahometan tyrants."

Of course, the real truth is, that the so-called "Christian" powers, with their gunboats and armies, no more represent Christianity than does the army of the Sultan. When it comes to action, they are moved by some selfish motive every time. For the sake of pecuniary gain, or to block the path of some ambitious rival, any one of them would side with that power which is the open and bitter enemy of Christianity, in its warfare upon those professing to be Christians. This is what their fleets and armies are for, and this is the kind of "Christianity" which makes use of fleets and armies. True Christianity has no use for either.
