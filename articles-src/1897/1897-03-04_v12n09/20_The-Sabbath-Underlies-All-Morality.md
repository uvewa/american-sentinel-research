In the annual report of the "New England Sabbath Protective League" for 1896, reference is made to the Sabbath as "that institution which underlies all morality and true religion." Yet there is no other commandment in the Decalogue which religious people treat so loosely. Any one of the other nine is assumed to mean what it says, and is taken as binding upon mankind just as it reads. No one seems to see any room for question about them. But when we come to the Sabbath commandment, which is no less plain, and specifies "the seventh day" as the Sabbath for all mankind, we are told that it does not mean the keeping of any particular day; but merely of "one day in seven." And some say that it is not binding at all, having somehow been dropped out of the Decalogue at the crucifixion of Christ. How can it be expected that any moral reformation will take place while religious teachers hold such views of "that institution which underlies all morality and true religion."?
