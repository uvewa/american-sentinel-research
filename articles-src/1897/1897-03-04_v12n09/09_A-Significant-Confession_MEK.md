BY M. E. KELLOGG.

The Christian Statesman, of January 2, contains a very interesting article under the heading, "The Americo-Armenian Question," signed by "American Citizen." The editor of the Statesman vouches for the "standing and responsibility" of the writer, who, I suspect, is a general contributor to that paper and devoted to its purposes. The article no doubt gives a truthful description of the way the Greek Church and Catholic Church priests connive together to hold the Armenians, Stundists, and other small sects of Christians, in check. But the strange thing about this article is that this writer cannot see that such acts are the natural outgrowth of the Church-and-State theory of government held by both the Pope of Rome and the Russian priests—that very theory which he and the Statesman are endeavoring to establish in this nation.

While the Greek Church and the Catholic Church are not agreed on all things, they are agreed on the principle that the State should support the Church. During the late Parliamentary struggles in Hungary, the clergy of both these churches have opposed themselves to the people who demand reforms. Each of these churches wants all there is, but upon a pinch they agree to stand by each other, each hoping that it will secure the larger proportion of the spoils.

Is not this about the same way that things are working in this country? The great churches are combining and pressing their claims upon the Government for recognition; one cannot do it alone, so there is a union of forces. Should there be a small sect, like the Adventists, in the way, the greatest good to the greatest number demands that it be crushed out! In other words, the great and dominant churches of our land propose to do to weak dissenters here the same thing that the Catholic and Greek churches propose to do with the Armenians and Stundists. Those Protestants who are in charge of this work in this country flatter themselves that they will at some future time eliminate the Catholic Church from the division of spoils of honors and emoluments, to be gained by a national religion. But they will suffer a most grievous disappointment. Even the writer in the Statesman above referred to, in the same article quoted, laments that the State Department of our Government is now controlled by the Jesuits. Thus he says:—

"Jesuits so control what we call our country, especially in its State Department, as they do that of most of the European courts, that they, the Jesuits, practically, are the country."

Thus, by this writer's own confession, the Jesuits are already entrenched in our Government and running it with a high hand. Many more proofs of this are given in the same article. Now this writer, in harmony with the paper in which his article appears, believes that this nation should take a position in a more authoritative manner than it yet has done as a Christian nation; that the whole national policy should be shaped in harmony with Christian principles. But who is to do this? According to his own statement—and his "standing and responsibility" are vouched for by the editor of the Statesman—the Catholic Church, represented by its most crafty order, the Jesuits, is even now managing Government affairs and is shaping the policy of this "Christian nation."

Can this power be dislodged from this vantage ground?—No, indeed; and every step taken toward forcing a national and governmental recognition of Christianity as the legalized religion of this nation elevates the Catholic Church and drives another nail into the coffin of Protestantism.

The only way by which Protestantism can have any hope of success in an encounter with organized and crafty Romanism is by the use of the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God. By that means Protestantism has won some notable victories. When she throws down that defensive weapon she is as helpless before Romanism as was Roderick Dhu when he threw away his shield to face on equal terms the more skillful Fitz-James. Protestants are giving up that Word. The Bible is not believed by them as it used to be. They are looking to other means to advance the religion they profess. They are particularly anxious for governmental acknowledgment, craving the same things which Catholics have so long enjoyed and in so many nations. They will find their budding prospects blasted in the very hour of their fancied success. Their hopes will be like—

"Dead Sea fruits which tempt the eye.
But turn to ashes on the lips."

That a recognition of Christianity by our Government will be of no particular use to Protestants this same writer confesses by saying that the indignities suffered by American Protestant missionaries in Turkey would not have been allowed by Jackson or Grant. But neither of these Presidents said so much for national Christianity as Mr. Cleveland has done. Thus national Christianity, in its practical results, means national advantages for Catholicism, but not for Protestants. Thus, Protestants prepare the soil, and sow the seed; Catholics watch its growth, and secure the harvest. That this must be so; that the whole effort now being made in this country to recognize Christianity as the religion of the nation will be used by the Roman Catholic Church for her own advantage and aggrandizement, the article in the Statesman is an unwilling but very significant confession.
