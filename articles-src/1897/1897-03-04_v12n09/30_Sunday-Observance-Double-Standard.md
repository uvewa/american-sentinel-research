A large part of the present-day teaching in regard to Sabbath observance simmers down to this: "It isn't the keeping of a particular day that is enjoined in the Sabbath commandment; that is a point that is not essential, provided you keep Sunday. You needn't be particular so far as the Lord is concerned; but if you don't keep Sunday, we'll get our Sunday law into operation and make you wish you had kept that particular day!
