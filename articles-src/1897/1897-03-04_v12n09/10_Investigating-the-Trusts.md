The Court of Inquiry which State Senator Lexow has been conducting against some of the Trusts doing business in New York City, discloses the desperate and doubtful nature of the contest which the people have begun for a curtailment of these baneful institutions. From the result of this attempt, it would seem that little if anything is to be expected from the State in this direction. The Trusts simply bade defiance to the State, and the State could not force them to do otherwise. Their representatives declined to produce the books which the State desired to inspect, and did not hesitate to "disremember" such facts and figures as the Trusts had determined to keep from public view.

In connection with this it is interesting to note that a recent decision of the Federal District Court has pronounced the Texas Anti-Trust law to be unconstitutional. This was a measure which prohibited all combinations to raise or lower prices, except of agricultural products and labor. The decision—which was rendered by Judge Swayne—very properly points out that such a measure denies the constitutional guaranty of the equal rights of citizens before the law, forbidding to twenty per cent. of the population what it allows to eighty per cent. Thus it falls under condemnation as class legislation. And it is difficult to see how a law against Trusts could be framed which would not be liable to condemnation in the courts upon similar grounds.

When the victims of the Trusts become convinced that no relief is to be hoped for through the regular methods of governmental procedure, they will have recourse to methods of their own which are now contemplated in the theory of republican government. Only as men become more willing to deal with their fellows by the principle of the Golden Rule, will there be any substantial relief from the evils which threaten the disruption of the Government.
