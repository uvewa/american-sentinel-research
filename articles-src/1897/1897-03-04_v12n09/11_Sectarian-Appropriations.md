The question whether public money shall be appropriated by Congress for sectarian schools is again before the National Legislature. The simple truth concerning this is that no public money can be rightfully taken for a sectarian use, and that when the people's money is thus misapplied in one case, it does not mend the matter to repeat the act in a number of other cases. No extension of wrong can ever make wrong right.
