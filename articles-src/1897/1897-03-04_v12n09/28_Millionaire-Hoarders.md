A well-known millionaire of this city, who condemned the extravagance of the late fancy dress ball, is reported as having recently taken a mortgage on the property of his own brother, who is in straitened circumstances, as security for a fifty-dollar loan. This furnishes an illustration of the most useless sort of individual a community can contain. The millionaire hoarder of wealth is far more to be condemned than the most reckless fortune squanderer that lives. See James 5:3.
