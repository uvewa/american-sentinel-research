BY A. SMITH.

NATIONAL Reformers, so called, are not only determined that existing State Sunday laws shall be enforced, but that national laws of that character shall be framed and put into effect against those who do not believe that day to be the Sabbath, and those who treat it with indifference as such.

Such laws are carnal weapons, used to coerce unbelievers. Such methods are not Christlike. Says Paul, "The weapons of our warfare are not carnal." 2 Cor. 10:4. None but carnal minds will use carnal weapons in defense of religious dogmas; and Paul says, "The carnal mind is enmity against God." Rom. 8:7.

Mahomet used carnal weapons to enforce his religion, and National Reformers and their numerous allies have entered upon a like career of coercion. The object to be gained and the method employed may be different in force, but the controlling spirit is the same. What difference does it make in principle whether one is compelled to observe a single religious dogma, or all the dogmas composing a given system of religion? There is none except in degree.

If the compulsory observance of Sunday as the weekly Sabbath is better, socially and morally, for unbelievers and the community in which they dwell, why not carry the principle further and compel everybody to profess religion? For, is not true religion a good thing for any community? At revival efforts people are urged in some way to make a public avowal of their purpose to serve the Lord; but many hesitate, and others sneer and oppose. Now would it not be a good National Reform scheme to cause a law to be framed to punish with fine or imprisonment those who refuse such earnest persuasion? Romanism and Mohammedanism furnish excellent examples of such methods.

Some of the State Sunday laws contain exemption clauses in favor of those who observe the seventh day as the Sabbath; but the law of God contains no exemption clause. It is morally wrong for anybody in the world to use the seventh day as secular time for God has declared it to be holy.

Sunday, as a sabbath, is a man-made institution; and the same power that embodied exemption clauses in the laws compelling its observance can abrogate such clauses at will whenever public sentiment may demand it. Are lovers of liberty willing to supinely surrender their God-given right to freedom of choice in matters of faith and attendant practices to any man or class of men who assume the place of God in dictating and enforcing morals? The greatest danger on this point lies in the fact that the people generally do not know their danger, and probably will not until this God-given boon shall have been forever lost.
