JUDGE KIMBALL, of the District of Columbia, before whom several newsboys were recently brought for having sold newspapers on Sunday in their accustomed manner, has decided that the ordinance under which they were charged is to be upheld as reasonable and just.

In his decision Judge Kimball says that "the use of all property, more especially that situated or used in the public streets, is subject to the exercise of the power of reasonable police supervision and regulation, for the protection of the public health and safety;" and that "in a case like the present, where the question is one of practical fact, unsettled by experience, and resting in opinion, a court should surely hesitate to set up its judgment in opposition to that of the municipal officers, who, by virtue of their training, observation and experience in the performance of their duties, ought to be well informed and capable of arriving at satisfactory conclusions in such matters." This is to say that it is merely a question of opinion, not settled by experience, whether the crying of papers by newsboys on Sunday is or is not inimical to "the public health and safety"! We could hardly imagine a statement more ridiculous.

If newsboys are threatening the public health and safety by crying their papers on Sunday, why are they permitted to do the same on Monday and other days of the week? What happens to put the public health and safety in the city of Washington in such an extraordinary state of precariousness on Sundays?

This is a matter which should have immediate investigation, for the enlightenment of the rest of the country which has not yet learned the danger to the public health that lies in the crying of newsboys selling papers on Sunday.

THE last years of the nineteenth century will be full of stirring events. The great struggle will be the effort to make this great secular nation profess Christianity.—Martinsburg, Pa., Weekly Herald.
