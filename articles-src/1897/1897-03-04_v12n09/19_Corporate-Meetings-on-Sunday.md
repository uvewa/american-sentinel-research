STATE SENATOR AHEARN, of New York, has undertaken to provide a remedy for corporations against the decisions of religiously-minded judges, of which an illustration was recently furnished by Judge Pryor. He has introduced a bill in the New York legislature to eliminate from the law governing corporate bodies, that provision which requires such associations to declare their times of meeting in the articles of incorporation.
