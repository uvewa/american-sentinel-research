In a report of a sermon preached in Cooper Union, New York City, February 22, Rev. A. C. Dixon is quoted as saying: "I am not going to make a patriotic address—though I'd like to. God pity the man who has no better country than this. It's the best country in this world; but there's a better country where Jesus Christ is King." We commend these words to the Christian Endeavors, who have set out to "enthrone Christ on Capitol Hill."
