In an effort to point out a similarity between the American Constitution and the religious system of the Papacy, a writer in the Catholic Standard and Times, of January 23, says that "According to the Constitution every citizen is eligible to the highest position in the gift of the people, and we all know that the highest post in the hierarchy is open to the humblest son of the church. In Church and State fitness and availability and not pedigree is the paramount claim to office."

This is probably the reason why Italy has been made to furnish nine tenths of the cardinals and popes.
