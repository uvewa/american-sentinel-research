Speaking of the zeal displayed by the press in England and America to obtain and publish the sentiments of the "holy father" at the Vatican respecting the proposed Anglo-American arbitration treaty, a prominent Catholic journal says: "There is much significance of the changed spirit of the times in secular newspapers thus seeking the view held on great public questions by the head of the Catholic Church."

Yes; the "spirit of the times" is giving marked evidence of deterioration from the sturdy independence which characterized the days of our fathers.
