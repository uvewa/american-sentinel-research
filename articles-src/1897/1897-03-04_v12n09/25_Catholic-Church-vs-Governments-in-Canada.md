A dispatch from Winnipeg, Manitoba, gives the information that "The battle between the Catholic Church and the Laurier and Greenway governments is to be renewed in the law courts. The government will appeal to the courts to declare the St. Boniface election void on the ground that Archbishop Langevin intimidated his parishioners by threats of excommunication if they did not vote for the church candidate." This election was carried by the Catholics, but by so slight a majority that it is regarded as a practical victory for the government.
