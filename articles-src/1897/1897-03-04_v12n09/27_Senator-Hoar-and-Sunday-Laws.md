The "New England Sabbath Protective League," at its second annual session, held last January, chose as its president U. S. Senator George F. Hoar, of Worcester, Mass. The latter was written a letter of acceptance of the office, in which he says: "I believe thoroughly in a day of rest, which shall be largely devoted to the contemplation of divine themes and to the worship of God and teaching His law, and in protecting the observance against disturbance by secular labor, or other discords, by law."
