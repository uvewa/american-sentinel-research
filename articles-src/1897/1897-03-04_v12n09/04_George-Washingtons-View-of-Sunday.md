In its issue of February 21, a New York journal quotes from a recent book by Paul Leicester Ford, entitled, "The True George Washington," the following concerning the latter's view of Sunday, as indicated by his words and practice:

"His daily 'where and how my time is spent,' enables us to know exactly how often he attended church, and in the year 1760 he went just sixteen times, and in 1768 he went fourteen, these years being fairly typical of the period 1760–1773. During the presidency a sense of duty made him attend St. Paul's and Christ churches while in New York and Philadelphia, but at Mount Vernon, when the public eye was not upon him, he was no more regular than he had always been, and in the last year of his life, he wrote:

"'Six days do I labor, or, in other words, take exercise and devote my time to various occupations in husbandry, and about my mansion. On the seventh, now called the first day, for want of a place of worship (within less than nine miles) such letters as do not require immediate acknowledgment, I give answers to. . . But it hath so happened, that on the last Sundays—call them the first or the seventh as you please, I have been unable to perform the latter duty on account of visits from strangers, with whom I could not use the freedom to leave alone, or recommend to the care of each other, for their amusement.'

## HE SOMETIMES WORKED ON SUNDAY.

"What he said here was more or less typical of his whole life. Sunday was always the day on which he wrote his private letters—even prepared his invoices—and he wrote to one of his overseers that his letters should be mailed so as to reach him Saturday, as by so doing they could be answered the following day. Nor did he limit himself to this, for he entertained company, closed land purchases, sold wheat, and, while a Virginia planter, went fox hunting on Sunday.

"It is to be noted, however, that he considered the scruples of others as to the day. When he went among his Western tenants rent collecting, he entered in his diary that, it 'being Sunday, and the people living on my land apparently very religious, it was thought best to postpone going among them till tomorrow,' and in his journey through New England, because it was 'contrary to the law and disagreeable to the people of this State (Connecticut) to travel on the sabbath day—and my horses, after passing through such intolerable roads, wanting rest, I stayed at Perkin's Tavern' (which, by the bye, is not a good one) all day—and a meeting-house being within a few rods of the door, I attended the morning and evening services, and heard very lame discourses from a Mr. Pond."

It thus appears that Washington neither regarded Sunday as a sacred day nor kept it as such, though he was always careful to respect the religious scruples of others. Is it true, then, as certain religious people would have us believe, that Sunday-keeping is an essential feature of the highest type of citizenship? It is generally admitted, we believe, outside of National Reform circles at least, that the "father of his country" was, in point of citizenship, as noble a type of manhood as this nation ever produced.
