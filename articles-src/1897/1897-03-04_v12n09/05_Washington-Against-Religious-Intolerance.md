Again, in the matter of respect for the religious scruples of his fellowmen, of whatever race or belief, Washington left an example worthy of imitation. How far his sympathies would have been from any effort to coerce men by Sunday laws or other religious legislation, may be judged from the following, also furnished by Mr. Ford:—

"There can be no doubt that religious intolerance was not a part of Washington's character. In 1775, when the New England troops intended to celebrate Guy Fawkes' Day, as usual, the General Orders declared that 'as the Commander-in-Chief has been appraised of a design, formed for the observance of that ridiculous and childish custom of burning the effigy of the Pope, he cannot help expressing his surprise that there should be officers and soldiers in this army so void of common sense as not to see the impropriety of such a step.'

"When trying to secure some servants, too, he wrote that 'if they are good workmen, they may be from Asia, Africa, or Europe; they may be Mahometans, Jews, or Christians, of any sect, or they may be Atheists.' When the bill taxing all the people of Virginia to support the Episcopal Church (his own) was under discussion, he threw his weight against it as far as concerned the taxing of other sectaries, but adding:—

"'Although no man's sentiments are more opposed to any kind of restraint upon religious principles than mine are, yet I must confess that I am not among the number of those who are so much alarmed at the thoughts of making people pay towards the support of that which they profess, if of the denominations of Christians, or to declare themselves Jews, Mahometans; or otherwise, and thereby obtain proper relief.

"'As the matter now stands I wish an assessment had never been agitated, and as it has gone so far, that the bill could die an easy death; because I think it will be productive of more quiet to the State, than by enacting it into a law, which in my opinion would be impolitic, admitting there is a decided majority for it, to the disquiet of a respectable minority. In the former case, the matter will soon subside; in the latter it will rankle and perhaps convulse the State.'

"Again in a letter he says:—

"'Of all the animosities which have existed among mankind those which are caused by difference of sentiment in religion appear to be the most inveterate and distressing, and ought most to be deprecated. I was in hopes that the enlightened and liberal policy which has marked the present age would at least have reconciled Christians of every denomination so far that we should never again see their religious disputes carried to such a pitch as to endanger the peace of society.'

"And to Lafayette, alluding to the proceedings of the Assembly of Notables, he wrote:—

"'I am not less ardent in my wish that you may succeed in your plan of toleration in religious matters. Being no bigot myself, I am disposed to indulge the professors of Christianity in the Church with that road to heaven which to them shall seem the most direct, plainest easiest, and least liable to exception.'"

If the people of America to-day would only entertain the same liberal, kindly sentiments toward their fellow-citizens, there would be no religious persecution, no demand for a "Christian Amendment" to the Constitution, and no movement for union of Church and State.
