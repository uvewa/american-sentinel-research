# A Dangerous Combination.

In 1829 the United States Senate said:—

> “Extensive religious combinations for political purposes are always dangerous.”

Now it is the literal truth that there has never before been such an extensive religious combination for any purpose, in this country, as there is now for the purpose of securing the enactment and enforcement of stringent Sunday laws. The National Reform Association, the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, all the leading Protestant churches, and the Roman Catholic Church, are all actively in favor of it, and the combination is daily growing more solid, and all these are doing their utmost to draw every other power into the combination. Here then there is fast drawing together the most extensive religious combination that there could possibly be in this Nation.

Now is it for a political purpose? Let one of their most active representatives answer. Dr. Wilbur F. Crafts, in his address to the United States Senate Committee on Education and Labor, said:—

> “Whatever is going to be law must first be *politics.* Therefore petitions to the National Conventions of *all political parties* asking that in their platforms National Sabbath Reform, as well as other reforms, may be favored, are in order. Do you say, ‘Keep the Sabbath out of politics’? It is already in. Its enemies have attacked it on the field of politics. If we do not defend it *on the same field,* our Sabbath laws will be destroyed. . . . This issue is a good one with which to settle these two supreme questions of *party politics.”*

By their own statements, then, this extensive religious combination is for a political purpose. Therefore, as extensive religious combinations for a political purpose are always dangerous; this most extensive religious combination for the political purpose of securing the enactment and enforcement of Sunday-laws *is most dangerous.*

Will the people see the danger in time to escape it? We give the warning, and shall continue to give it. Will the people heed the warning?
