# The Annual Convention of the National Reform Association.

The largest, and in many respects the most important, convention of representative National Reformers ever held in this country, was the recent annual meeting, in “Association Hall,” Fifteenth and Chestnut Streets, Philadelphia, on the 24th, 25th, and 26th days of April last, the result of what was denominated the “Call for a National Conference on the Christian Principles of Civil Government.” All those present seemed to so regard it, although it was represented as being designed only as a prelude to a much larger and far more important assembly, to be convened in some more central city of the Union at no distant day.

The program appeared to have been gotten up for the purpose of discussing from their point of view the entire range of subjects embraced in National Reform. In fact, fears were expressed in the response to the address of welcome, that the audience might be bewildered by the “wonderful scope of the program.” In their various phases, were discussed the School Question, Religion or Christianity as Related to Politics and Politicians, Christ’s Kingship, Woman’s Work for Christ, the Temperance Question, the Chinese [46] Question, the Indian Question, the Sabbath (Sunday) Question, the Proposed Christian Amendment, Marriage and Divorce, and the Press as Related to Christian Civilization, all of which they are wont to include in the phrase, “The Christian Principles of Civil Government.”

With a peculiar zest and an apparently unbounded confidence, they quote their watchword, “The world for the world’s Redeemer,” just as though the whole world, now so full of iniquity, were to be converted fully to Christ through the principles which they advocate. Really, they seem to be able to perceive few but good omens for the future; and they are laying more extensive plans for enlarging their work. In the words of the report presented by the Executive Committee: “There are some clouds in the air, but the sky is full of stars, and above all sits the reigning Lord. Let us with accumulated faith plan the work for the coming year.” And again: “The field is white to the harvest, and the laborers are anxious to enter in. It is the hour of the world’s need. Thoughtful men are everywhere forecasting the future with anxious fears. . . . The kingdoms of the earth will not know peace until they find it under the scepter of him who is the Prince of peace. The principles of this association are world-wide in their application.”

The sentiment of the South in regard to this movement was represented as being very favorable, although the fact has been but little known until recently; and they think that this will form the link of union between the two sections of the country. Mr. Alexander, the first vice-president of the National Reform Association, and the presiding officer of this convention, represented a Baptist minister of Atlanta, Georgia, as answering his expression of astonishment at there being no necessity for the discussion of these questions there, by saying, “My dear sir, these are the principles that I have been preaching for twenty years.” Mr. Alexander continued: “There is no particular opposition with them; . . . and I am confident, brethren, from what I have seen in the South, that we shall have less controversy upon these great subjects, much less discussion, in the South than in the North.” On Wednesday afternoon of the convention, after an address on “The Kingly Office of Christ,” by W. R. Terrett, of Saratoga Springs, and another on “American Politics and Christianity,” by W. M. Grier, of South Carolina, O. P. Fitzgerald, of Tennessee, speaking of the two addresses, said: “The two sections have met and kissed each other. They have clasped hands upon the platform of the Bible. I hereby announce the bans. And we are hereby going to stand on this platform of Christian citizenship,—anti stand together, and pray together, and fight this battle together, and vote together, and preserve the institutions of Christian civilization as long as the winter snows lie white on your Northern hills, or the mellow breezes of the tropics stir the magnolia blooms of the South.” The same speaker, in his address on “The Nation as a Sabbath Breaker,” said: “I think the South will lead in this reform. It would be a shame to the South if it did not.”

On the subject of Sunday legislation, these leaders are simply uncompromising in their statements. The idea of exempting dissenters from the penalties of the law is to them simply ridiculous, and entirely out of the question. One speaker, after referring to the fact that some conscientiously observed the seventh day of the week, asked, “Shall the State governments and the general Government modify these laws to satisfy the consciences of individuals, however honest or earnest they may be?” And answered in these words, “Why, it would be considered the supremest folly, and criminality as well.” He illustrated by reference to the Quakers, saying that they could not be exempted from paying taxes for the support of the War Department, simply because they do not believe in war. Another person, referring to the same subject, said that observers of the seventh day ought to consider it a great blessing that they could have two days in the week in which to rest, and to worship God. There is only one consistent explanation of this statement, and that is that such ought to consider it a great favor on the part of the Government to grant them the privilege of resting on the seventh day of the week. Otherwise the National Reformers ought to advocate the observance of two consecutive days in the week instead of only one for all Christian people. In this connection it should be borne in mind that these are the expressions of representative National Reformers, and to an audience of sympathizing representative listeners.

A casual notice is sufficient to discover that one of the main objects is to enlist in their ranks all the talent and influence which can be secured for the advancement of their cause. This was made strikingly apparent by the way in which they increased their already long list of vice-presidents. The motion was made and supported that all those citizens of Philadelphia whose names were attached to the call for the convention, should be made vice-presidents of the association, when, without discussion, it was put and unanimously carried. By this simple act, and without the consent of the persons concerned, seventy-eight new officers were elected. One cannot but be impressed, too, by the titles of, dignity and honor showered upon those who came upon the platform; impressed, too, by the contrast between this spirit and the spirit manifested by the meek and lowly Jesus; and this of itself, in my mind, is sufficient to show that the Spirit of God is not leading them in their work. Their desire is for the praise of men, and surely they have their reward. Their introductions, I imagine, are not such as the apostle Paul would have given of Barnabas, or Barnabas of Paul. Notwithstanding all this, one can hardly breathe in the atmosphere of only a few days’ convention without feeling that this movement will finally succeed— not, surely, in the achievement of their object of bringing the Nation to Christ, but in plunging it into the evils of a religious despotism.
