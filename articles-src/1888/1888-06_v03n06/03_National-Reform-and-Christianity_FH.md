# National Reform and Christianity.

National Reformers talk of enforcing their religious belief upon all that come among them. But how does that compare with Christianity? If they force a man to practice religious duties against his will, they so far destroy his liberty; but if they destroy liberty in an intelligent being, they to that extent destroy his moral responsibility, that is, they destroy his free moral agency. Consequently they would destroy the doctrine of grace, which is the infusion of divine aid to help man do that which he is convinced is right. But the doctrine of grace is the very foundation of Christianity, and if they destroy that, every other doctrine goes with it. Thus National Reform is subversive of Christianity.

God leaves man perfectly at liberty to serve him or not. Says he, "Choose you this day whom ye will serve," and even when a man chooses not to serve him, but to make his whole life a life of sin and iniquity, God does not take from him the power necessary to do that, But these Reformers would compel a man to serve God in spite of God's witness against it. Love is the link that binds God to man. Can love be forced? Can men be brought to Christ by threatening them with the rack or the stake? Compulsion would make man hate God even worse, and only those who were impelled by fear or by policy would obey, and all such obedience is an abomination to God. The Spirit of Christ is, "Come unto me." The spirit of the National Reformers is, "If you don't we'll make you." The contrast is rather striking. Had Noah undertaken to drive those timid birds into the ark he would have made sorry work, but these Reformers will even do worse when they try to enforce the laws of their idea of Christian morality upon all who come among them.
