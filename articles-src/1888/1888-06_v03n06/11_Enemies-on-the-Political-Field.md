Doctor Crafts says of the Sunday in politics:—

> "Its enemies have already attacked it on the field of politics."

But "its enemies" never attacked it on the field of politics until its friends attempted to sustain it on the field of politics. The first advances into the field of politics were by the Sunday-law forces, the guantlet was by them first thrown down upon the political field, and if "its enemies" accepted the challenge, its friends have but themselves to blame.
