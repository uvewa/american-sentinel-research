# Woman and the Advent.

We used to think that the ballot in the hands of women would be the "handwriting on the wall" for the saloons of our land. But when we learned that there are in the city of Philadelphia alone 6,000 women *engaged in the liquor business,* that fact gave the prospect a somewhat different complexion. Whether or not there are in Philadelphia 6,000 well-bred, pure, and noble women who, if women could vote, would arm themselves with the ballot and go to the polls in behalf of law, sobriety, and home, may be something of a question; but if the privilege of suffrage was theirs, it is pretty certain that 6,000 ballots in that city would go from the hands of a certain class of women solid for rum. There are vicious women as well as vicious men; and the ballot in the hands of these would offset as many in the hands of the good and true.

But while the prospect in this direction appears less hopeful, evidence is more and more frequently appearing to show that women are as susceptible, at least as men, to fanaticism, and would be in danger of using the power of the ballot under the influence of prejudice and blind impulse, as often, perhaps, as under the guidance of intelligence and reason. That this is no uncharitable judgment, we offer as evidence the following paragraph from the "Prospectus of Evangelistic Board of the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union for 1888," as published in the *Christian Statesman,* of April 26, 1888:—

> "As Christ came first by Mary alone in the stable at Bethlehem, so shall he *come the second time,* to reign King and Lord, by *this confederation of the women* of the whole world, exalted to the high place which is hers under the gospel; not only as the mother and educator of lawmakers and rulers, but set free from the domination of mere animal force, herself co-ruler and legislator in the State as well as in the home, according to God's evident plan that the world should not always be left *comfortless."*

In this quotation the italics are ours, with the exception of this last word, which we give as we find it. Allusion is evidently made to John 14:18, where Christ assures his sorrowing disciples, to comfort them in view of his departure to Heaven, that he will return again: "I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you."

Does the language of the extract quoted above mean that this "confederation of the women" is to *be* the second coming of Christ? that *through them* he is to reign King and Lord over the earth? Or does it mean that his second personal coming is dependent on this "confederation of the women"? With either view the position is unscriptural and fanatical enough to suit an Ignatius Loyola. It is easy to see how women who are ready to entertain such views, could be induced, under the subtle deceptions of the National Reform Association, to embark in favor of an oppressive Sunday law, which would ride rough-shod over the most sacred rights of conscience, and the dearest liberties of mankind. *—Review and Herald. *[88]
