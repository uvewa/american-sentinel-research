# Rome’s Work.

At the late Conference of the Evangelical Alliance, Bishop A. C. Coxe, of New York, gave an address on “Ultramontanism,” in which he spoke of the relationship of Roman Catholics to our Constitution and laws, and showed the danger to our institutions from the evil workings of Rome. We present the following extract as containing points of special interest to American citizens just now, especially as the National Reform Association is commissioned to secure “if possible” the co-operation of Rome, in its designs upon our Constitution, and our public schools.

> “Happily, the spirit of the Gallican maxims has its equivalents in our American Constitution, and it is actually imbedded in the naturalization laws. Let me quote them, in brief, as follows:—

“‘1. The alien seeking to be naturalized must make oath two years beforehand of his *bona-fide* intention to become a citizen of the United States, and to *renounce forever all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, State, or sovereignty;* in particular that to which he has been subject.

“‘ 2. When he applies for naturalization after the two years thus provided for, he must prove that he has resided in the United States live years at least; that during that time he has behaved as a man of good moral character, attached to the principles of the Constitution, and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the same.

“‘ 3. If he has borne any hereditary title, or been of any of the orders of nobility in the kingdom or State from which he came, he shall in addition to the above requisites make an express renunciation of his title or order of nobility.

“‘ 4. Finally, he shall at the time of his application make oath that he will support the Constitution of the United States, and that he *absolutely and entirely renounces and abjures all allegiance and fidelity* to every foreign prince, potentate, State, or sovereignty, particularly the State or sovereignty of which he has been a subject.’ ”—*Revised Statutes of the United States. Title XXX, page 380. Washington. 1875.*

> “In brief, then, our Constitution, as interpreted by legislation, asserts Home Rule for Americans. It assumes that no foreign potentate whatever shall be permitted to dictate to us in matters of politics, of society, of legislation, of jurisprudence, of education, or of government in any of its forms. No American citizen shall be subject to any foreign court, so that he may be summoned to a foreign country to answer for his political conduct, or for anything affecting his rights as a citizen. Our country is competent to manage its own affairs; to settle the delicate relations between labor and capital, and to regulate associations and organizations among the people, without inquiring of a foreign court, ignorant of our conditions, our wants, and the spirit of our laws, what Americans may lawfully do.

> “Take, for example, the case of a Roman Catholic citizen who happens to be an ecclesiastic, and who assumes a political position, which some regard as in conflict with his vocation; let his local superiors settle the ecclesiastical question here among themselves and give him just judgment, where, if they rob him of his profession and means of livelihood unjustly, they can be punished by the laws. As an American, he cannot lawfully be summoned beyond seas, to be judged by an Italian court. For look, if he can be thus dealt with for a wrong position, he may, also, be cited abroad and punished for a right one. If they may call him to account in Italy for his conduct in America when he votes for an agrarian, so, also, when it comes to sustaining our common-school system, he may be cited to Rome and stripped of his profession, because he votes to uphold and to perpetuate it.
> “If this can be done in one case, so in a thousand; and by terrorism, a thousand ecclesiastics may be forced to vote as an Italian dictates (an Antonelli, perhaps, or another Borgia), and every such ecclesiastic will control a thousand lay voters by like terrorism. What then? The Government itself may be turned into a dependency of the Court of Rome. The balance of power may enable a minority to usurp the functions of government under color of law, and lo! we are transformed into a Mexico, with no choice but to bow our necks to a foreign domination, or to involve ourselves in religious wars for the preservation of freedom. See how wise are our laws in their unconscious Gallicanism; intolerant of all foreign interference, and, as I said, asserting Home Rule for Americans. We choose to be governed by ourselves, as were our Anglo-Saxon forefathers by themselves, in the darkest days of Papal domination. It was then that they said to the Italians: *‘Nolumus leges Angliæ mutari?* We say just as emphatically of our American laws and constitutions: We will not suffer them to be altered by any foreign dictation whatever.
> “But what is our actual concern with these [23] principles just now? Are we threatened with alien interference and with a foreign power to influence and overawe our elections? I leave it to your own burning sense of recent events to frame the proper reply. The proposal to introduce a Papal nuncio into the Republic; the residence among us of a cardinal, who is a foreign prince, and bound to a foreign court by obligations which no American has any right to assume; the goings to and fro of ecclesiastics to consult an alien potentate as to our domestic questions of labor and labor associations, and to prescribe to our citizens what they may do or not do in such issues; and the proposed establishment, in this capital, of a university under the authority of a pontiff who, whatever the virtues of his private character, has been forced to re-invest the Jesuits with unlimited powers, and with functions against which every Roman Catholic Government in Europe has protested, not only in words, but by banishing the Jesuits as public enemies and confiscating their estates; I ask, Are not these tokens of peril to be resisted here and now and for all time to come? Are they not the prelude to an open assault upon our common schools, and their subversion through political subserviency?
> “Archbishop Lynch, of Toronto, in a letter to Lord Randolph Churchill, reminds him that he and his confraternity hold the *balance of power* in Canada, and through it have controlled the elections there; and he goes on to assert that by a similar use of the *balance of power, *presidential elections will be decided in this Republic.
> “In California, certain ultramontane dignitaries have insulted American social ties of the most sacred character, by reflecting on the marriages of the vast majority of our countrymen as mere concubinage.
> “Our school system is denounced in terms the most flagrant, and a counter-system is set up in which the un-American ideas of the Syllabus are to be imposed on thousands of our future voters. I hold in my hand a book issued by the ‘Catholic Publication Society’ in New York, and by affiliated publishers in Baltimore and Cincinnati. It is printed in Baltimore, under license of its late Archbishop (Bailey) and the certificate of his official censor, that it is unobjectionable—‘n*ihil obstat.’* It is a book of instruction for children. Its motto is (quoted from Benedict XIV.), ‘We affirm that the greatest part of the damned are in hell, because they did not know those mysteries of faith which Christians must know and believe.’ What are these mysteries? Let us read this authorized ultramontane school-book.
> “I quote (pp. 97-104) as follows:—
*“’Question.* Have Protestants any faith in Christ?

*“‘Answer.* They never had.

*“‘Q.* Why not?

*“‘A.* Because there never lived such a Christ as they imagine and believe in.

*“‘Q.* In what kind of a Christ do they believe?

*“‘A.* In such an one of whom they can make a liar, with impunity, whose doctrine they can interpret as they please, and who does not care what a man believes, provided he be an honest man before the public.

*“‘Q.* Will such a faith in such a Christ save Protestants?

“‘*A.* No sensible man will assert such an absurdity.

“‘Q. What will Christ say to them on the day of Judgment?

*“‘A.* I know you not, because you never knew me. . . .

*“‘Q.* Are Protestants willing to confess their sins to a Catholic bishop or priest, who alone has power from Christ to forgive sins? “Whose sins you shall forgive they are forgiven them.”

*“’A.* No; for they generally have an utter aversion to confession, and therefore their sins will not be forgiven them throughout all eternity.

*“‘Q.* What follows from this?

“‘A That they die in their sins and are damned.’ ”

And these are the people with whom the National Reform Association “will gladly join hands,” as soon as the Catholics will consent. And these are the ones into whose hands the National Reformers will willingly put the public schools whenever the Catholics are in the majority. The wicked scheme!

We believe that moral reforms must be wrought by moral agencies. Christians must do Christian work by Christian methods, and in the spirit of Christ. Men are to be saved not by wholesale but one at a time. The gospel must be preached to every creature; it is the personal message of a personal salvation. All this we firmly hold, and have no disposition to substitute other agencies or methods. But can it be wondered at that Christian zeal and endeavor are paralyzed in view of the fact that the whisky saloon, the fountain and fortress of vice, is intrenched behind the law, and that the statutes against the social evil are a dead letter? The law of the land itself becomes the minister of evil, and the officer of the law the protector rather than the terror of evil-doers. The Christianity that thus crystallizes itself into heathen practices cannot be wholly genuine; it is a sham Christianity in so far as it supports or compromises with these evils.—*Nashville Christian Advocate. *[24]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some friend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

The American Sentinel is, as everybody can see, only an eight-page paper, and is issued only once a month. It is evident, therefore, that we cannot publish everything, nor can we print in one number everything that comes within our province. When people send us communications, or extracts from papers, they must have patience if they do not appear at once. “All things come’round to him who will but wait.”

> “Friend, please stop the American Sentinel,” was the word that came post haste from Kansas a few days ago. We have not the slightest doubt but that there are many who would like to have us stop the Sentinel, but we cannot gratify them, because there are so very many who write of the Sentinel in a strain similar to the following from a prominent judge in a Southern State: “I read each number that comes, and I think with increasing interest.” The Sentinel will not stop.

We would call the attention of the friends of the Sentinel to our bound volumes. Volume 2 of the American Sentinel neatly bound in manilla, with index, is now ready. Price, 60 cents. Better still are volumes 1 and 2 bound in one cloth volume, with index of each volume. Price, $1.75 post-paid. Those who are studying the subject of National Reform, will find the two volumes bound in one just the thing for them. Nobody could do a better thing than to buy a copy to present to some friend.

The Sentinel has not space to waste in personalities. It is opposed not to National Reformers, but to National Reform. Our friend N. R. Johnston enters a grevious complaint against us in the last number of the *Statesman,* because a certain article of his was not published in the Sentinel. As he says, we have published one or two articles from him. We went so far as to agree to publish them, before we saw them, because we felt sure that he would confine himself to the main points. So when he again asked for space, we again assented; but when we found that the most of one of the articles needed no reply, and was not really upon National Reform, we informed him that we had not space for it. We would have published one; but as he insisted that it must be both or none, we returned both. At the same time we informed him that whenever he would furnish us with straight National Reform matter, we would publish it. This he does not tell the readers of the *Statesman.*

We make this note of explanation simply that all may know that the Sentinel does not intend to shut out free and fair discussion of National Reform principles from its columns. Nothing would please us better than to receive for every number, from any representative National Reformer, short, pithy articles on National Reform, telling our readers just what National Reform is, and what it wants. This doesn’t mean, though, that we propose to resign the editorial management of the Sentinel into the hands of the National Reformers.

Truth never demands a vote. It refuses to go to the poll or to acknowledge majorities. It presents its evidence and claims submission. To attempt to gather truth out of a multitude of errors, by setting them to neutralize each other, is to revive the vain alchemy of the middle ages to turn iron into gold, or to imitate the folly of an old student of prophecy, who gathered some scores of conflicting prophetic dates together, and struck the mean among them in order to reach the true year. *—Horatius Bonar, D. D.*

The November (1887) number of the Sentinel contained some of the questions and answers given at the Lakeside National Reform Convention. Among them was one by Dr. McAllister, in which he was reported as saying, in answer to the question if the success of National Reform would not result in persecution: “False religion will be persecuted, and the State will be the persecutor.” Mr. McAllister says that what he did say was that “a false religion *will persecute.”* We very gladly make the correction, for we have no design to misrepresent anybody. The truth about the National Reform Association is more damaging to it than any erroneous statement could be. When we have more space than we have in this number, we shall notice Mr. McAllister’s statement more at length.

> “District” Secretary, Rev. M. A. Gault, in a report in the *Christian Statesman* of August 11, tells of his attendance at a Prohibition convention at Lake Side Rink, Racine, Wis., at which he “had the privilege of presenting the cause of God in Government here on the same platform with Colonel Bain, and Governor St John.” Speaking further of Colonel Bain he says:—

> “He shook my hand warmly as I left the platform, saying how much he sympathized with the National Reform movement. He said he had received a letter some time ago from the editor of the American Sentinel in California, telling him how much mischief there was in our movement, and asking him to write some articles for the Sentinel.”
We are most happy to inform Mr. Bain that he is most prodigiously mistaken. We know that Mr. Bain never received a letter from the editor of the American Sentinel, because we happen to know that the editor of the Sentinel never sent him a letter. Nor did the editor of the American Sentinel, nor any person authorized by the editor of the Sentinel, ever ask Colonel Bain to write a single article, much less “s*ome articles* for the Sentinel.” We would suggest that the excellent Colonel read his letters a little more carefully.

Further Mr. Gault says of him:—

> “He wrote in reply [to the letter that he didn’t get from the editor of the Sentinel] that our country had been drifting devilward long enough, and he was disposed to sympathize with any movement to help it Godward.”

Mr. Bain may have written such a letter to somebody; he may have written it to the editor of the Sentinel; but that no such letter was ever received by us is certain. If we had received it we might have said to him that it is true enough that our country has been, and is, “drifting devilward,” but whereas now it is only “drifting,” the effect of National Reform will be but to set it *full-sail* in that direction.

Hitherto the Sentinel has used the phrase “union of Church and State” in calling attention to the rapid encroachments of the ecclesiastical upon the civil power in this country and in making known our opposition to it. But those who are zealously working for the union of Church and State here, constantly seek to dodge, and to deaden as far as possible, the force of the Sentinel’s arguments, by the sophistical plea that they are “all thoroughly opposed to any union of Church and State,” while at the same time they are all just as thoroughly in favor of a union of Religion and the State. “Church and State,” say they, “is always an unmixed evil. But Religion and State is another thing. That is a good tiling,—and that is what we aim to make a feature of our institutions, and we are going to have it.”

Now the Sentinel does not propose to work at cross purposes, neither does it intend to spend any time in drawing hair-splitting distinctions between terms, therefore let it be forever understood that the American Sentinel is uncompromisingly opposed to any union of Religion and the State. For such a union can end only in the worst of all tyrannies—the tyranny of a religious despotism. In reality there is no difference, of course, between a union of Church and State and a union of Religion and the State, but as those who favor the wicked thing, endeavor to disguise it under the apparently mellow term “Religion and State,” we, likewise, in exposing it, shall hereafter use that term rather than the phrase “Church and State.” This, not because we admit for a moment that there is any difference at all, but solely to prevent them from dodging our arguments. But let it be understood that our opposition to so-called Religion and the State, is due solely to our love for true religion and the individual. [25]
