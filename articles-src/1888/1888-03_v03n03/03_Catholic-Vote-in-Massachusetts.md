Lovers of our American institutions must learn to vote independently on matters that pertain to public schools. Parties as such cannot be trusted. Says an evening paper: "In Massachusetts they tried to raise an issue against the Roman Catholics on the school question, and yet the Republican speaker of the last House, who is to be re-elected, living in a district where there is a large Catholic vote, based his appeal to the voters on his having aided in obtaining State subsidies for a Catholic institution, and obtained hundreds of votes in this way. Moreover, Governor Ames somewhat ostentatiously made a large gift to a Catholic college a few months ago, and since the election he ridicules the idea that the public-school issue had any effect upon the result." *—New York Observer.*
