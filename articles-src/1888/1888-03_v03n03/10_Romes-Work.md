At the late Conference of the Evangelical Alliance, Bishop A. C. Coxe, of New York, gave an address on "Ultramontanism," in which he spoke of the relationship of Roman Catholics to our Constitution and laws, and showed the danger to our institutions from the evil workings of Rome. We present the following extract as containing points of special interest to American citizens just now, especially as the National Reform Association is commissioned to secure "if possible" the co-operation of Rome, in its designs upon our Constitution, and our public schools.

> "Happily, the spirit of the Gallican maxims has its equivalents in our American Constitution, and it is actually imbedded in the naturalization laws. Let me quote them, in brief, as follows:—

"'1. The alien seeking to be naturalized must make oath two years beforehand of his *bona-fide* intention to become a citizen of the United States, and to *renounce forever all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, State, or sovereignty;* in particular that to which he has been subject.

"' 2. When he applies for naturalization after the two years thus provided for, he must prove that he has resided in the United States five years at least; that during that time he has behaved as a man of good moral character, attached to the principles of the Constitution, and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the same.

"' 3. If he has borne any hereditary title, or been of any of the orders of nobility in the kingdom or State from which he came, he shall in addition to the above requisites make an express renunciation of his title or order of nobility.

"' 4. Finally, he shall at the time of his application make oath that he will support the Constitution of the United States, and that he *absolutely and entirely renounces and abjures all allegiance and fidelity* to every foreign prince, potentate, State, or sovereignty, particularly the State or sovereignty of which he has been a subject.' "—*Revised Statutes of the United States. Title XXX, page 380. Washington. 1875.*

> "In brief, then, our Constitution, as interpreted by legislation, asserts Home Rule for Americans. It assumes that no foreign potentate whatever shall be permitted to dictate to us in matters of politics, of society, of legislation, of jurisprudence, of education, or of government in any of its forms. No American citizen shall be subject to any foreign court, so that he may be summoned to a foreign country to answer for his political conduct, or for anything affecting his rights as a citizen. Our country is competent to manage its own affairs; to settle the delicate relations between labor and capital, and to regulate associations and organizations among the people, without inquiring of a foreign court, ignorant of our conditions, our wants, and the spirit of our laws, what Americans may lawfully do.

> "Take, for example, the case of a Roman Catholic citizen who happens to be an ecclesiastic, and who assumes a political position, which some regard as in conflict with his vocation; let his local superiors settle the ecclesiastical question here among themselves and give him just judgment, where, if they rob him of his profession and means of livelihood unjustly, they can be punished by the laws. As an American, he cannot lawfully be summoned beyond seas, to be judged by an Italian court. For look, if he can be thus dealt with for a wrong position, he may, also, be cited abroad and punished for a right one. If they may call him to account in Italy for his conduct in America when he votes for an agrarian, so, also, when it comes to sustaining our common-school system, he may be cited to Rome and stripped of his profession, because he votes to uphold and to perpetuate it.
> "If this can be done in one case, so in a thousand; and by terrorism, a thousand ecclesiastics may be forced to vote as an Italian dictates (an Antonelli, perhaps, or another Borgia), and every such ecclesiastic will control a thousand lay voters by like terrorism. What then? The Government itself may be turned into a dependency of the Court of Rome. The balance of power may enable a minority to usurp the functions of government under color of law, and lo! we are transformed into a Mexico, with no choice but to bow our necks to a foreign domination, or to involve ourselves in religious wars for the preservation of freedom. See how wise are our laws in their unconscious Gallicanism; intolerant of all foreign interference, and, as I said, asserting Home Rule for Americans. We choose to be governed by ourselves, as were our Anglo-Saxon forefathers by themselves, in the darkest days of Papal domination. It was then that they said to the Italians: *'Nolumus leges Angliæ mutari?* We say just as emphatically of our American laws and constitutions: We will not suffer them to be altered by any foreign dictation whatever.
> "But what is our actual concern with these [23] principles just now? Are we threatened with alien interference and with a foreign power to influence and overawe our elections? I leave it to your own burning sense of recent events to frame the proper reply. The proposal to introduce a Papal nuncio into the Republic; the residence among us of a cardinal, who is a foreign prince, and bound to a foreign court by obligations which no American has any right to assume; the goings to and fro of ecclesiastics to consult an alien potentate as to our domestic questions of labor and labor associations, and to prescribe to our citizens what they may do or not do in such issues; and the proposed establishment, in this capital, of a university under the authority of a pontiff who, whatever the virtues of his private character, has been forced to re-invest the Jesuits with unlimited powers, and with functions against which every Roman Catholic Government in Europe has protested, not only in words, but by banishing the Jesuits as public enemies and confiscating their estates; I ask, Are not these tokens of peril to be resisted here and now and for all time to come? Are they not the prelude to an open assault upon our common schools, and their subversion through political subserviency?
> "Archbishop Lynch, of Toronto, in a letter to Lord Randolph Churchill, reminds him that he and his confraternity hold the *balance of power* in Canada, and through it have controlled the elections there; and he goes on to assert that by a similar use of the *balance of power, *presidential elections will be decided in this Republic.
> "In California, certain ultramontane dignitaries have insulted American social ties of the most sacred character, by reflecting on the marriages of the vast majority of our countrymen as mere concubinage.
> "Our school system is denounced in terms the most flagrant, and a counter-system is set up in which the un-American ideas of the Syllabus are to be imposed on thousands of our future voters. I hold in my hand a book issued by the 'Catholic Publication Society' in New York, and by affiliated publishers in Baltimore and Cincinnati. It is printed in Baltimore, under license of its late Archbishop (Bailey) and the certificate of his official censor, that it is unobjectionable—'n*ihil obstat.'* It is a book of instruction for children. Its motto is (quoted from Benedict XIV.), 'We affirm that the greatest part of the damned are in hell, because they did not know those mysteries of faith which Christians must know and believe.' What are these mysteries? Let us read this authorized ultramontane school-book.
> "I quote (pp. 97-104) as follows:—
*"'Question.* Have Protestants any faith in Christ?

*"'Answer.* They never had.

*"'Q.* Why not?

*"'A.* Because there never lived such a Christ as they imagine and believe in.

*"'Q.* In what kind of a Christ do they believe?

*"'A.* In such an one of whom they can make a liar, with impunity, whose doctrine they can interpret as they please, and who does not care what a man believes, provided he be an honest man before the public.

*"'Q.* Will such a faith in such a Christ save Protestants?

"'*A.* No sensible man will assert such an absurdity.

"'Q. What will Christ say to them on the day of Judgment?

*"'A.* I know you not, because you never knew me. . . .

*"'Q.* Are Protestants willing to confess their sins to a Catholic bishop or priest, who alone has power from Christ to forgive sins? "Whose sins you shall forgive they are forgiven them."

*"'A.* No; for they generally have an utter aversion to confession, and therefore their sins will not be forgiven them throughout all eternity.

*"'Q.* What follows from this?

"'A That they die in their sins and are damned.' "

And these are the people with whom the National Reform Association "will gladly join hands," as soon as the Catholics will consent. And these are the ones into whose hands the National Reformers will willingly put the public schools whenever the Catholics are in the majority. The wicked scheme!
