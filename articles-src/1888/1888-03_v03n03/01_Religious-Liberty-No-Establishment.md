It is the glory of our country that we have no church establishment, and that ecclesiastical differences are not settled by State enactment. Each sect here is allowed to stand upon an equal footing under the law; to enjoy equal privileges before the people; and to prove by its merits its adaptation to popular needs. In the end, that one will be accepted by the largest number which shall prove itself most useful. This, and this alone, is religious liberty.—*Selected.*
