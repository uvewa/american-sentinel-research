We believe that moral reforms must be wrought by moral agencies. Christians must do Christian work by Christian methods, and in the spirit of Christ. Men are to be saved not by wholesale but one at a time. The gospel must be preached to every creature; it is the personal message of a personal salvation. All this we firmly hold, and have no disposition to substitute other agencies or methods. But can it be wondered at that Christian zeal and endeavor are paralyzed in view of the fact that the whisky saloon, the fountain and fortress of vice, is intrenched behind the law, and that the statutes against the social evil are a dead letter? The law of the land itself becomes the minister of evil, and the officer of the law the protector rather than the terror of evil-doers. The Christianity that thus crystallizes itself into heathen practices cannot be wholly genuine; it is a sham Christianity in so far as it supports or compromises with these evils.—*Nashville Christian Advocate. *[24]
