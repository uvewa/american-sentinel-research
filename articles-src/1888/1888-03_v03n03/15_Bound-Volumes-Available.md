We would call the attention of the friends of the Sentinel to our bound volumes. Volume 2 of the American Sentinel neatly bound in manilla, with index, is now ready. Price, 60 cents. Better still are volumes 1 and 2 bound in one cloth volume, with index of each volume. Price, $1.75 post-paid. Those who are studying the subject of National Reform, will find the two volumes bound in one just the thing for them. Nobody could do a better thing than to buy a copy to present to some friend.
