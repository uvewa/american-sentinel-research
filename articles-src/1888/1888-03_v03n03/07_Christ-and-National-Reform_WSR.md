This plan of extending Christ's kingdom through political agitation discloses great moral degeneracy. It will, I think, be easily seen when we consider that love to God is the only return we can make to him for his wondrous love to us. Hence the Scripture says that "love is the fulfilling of the law." The absurdity of the National Reform movement is the supposition that men can be made to love God by compulsion, or restrained from not loving him.

Christ said, "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me"—evidently by the drawing power of that unexampled love shown in thus voluntarily suffering an awful death. Yet the spirit of the present day seems to perceive that the drawing power of Jesus' love is inadequate, and with *shame* let it be said, proposes to institute civil measures to draw men unto God. The apostle says, "We love him because he first loved us," but these men, evidently knowing nothing of the nature of that love, say we will have men to love God because it is popular to do so, or because the law of the land constrains them. If men are not touched in their hearts by the dying love of Christ, it is the height of absurdity to try to compel them. Anyone ought to be able to see that a law to the effect that men should have their hearts melted in view of Christ's love to them would be nonsense, if not worse.

In opposition to this, stand the words of the apostle, "The love of Christ constraineth us." Oh, if poor, neglected Jesus wept over callous-hearted Jerusalem, because love was rejected, how would he weep over this movement to supplant the Holy Spirit of love by machinery of unhallowed invention.

Do not angels say, "They know not what love is? " and will not hell enlarge herself without measure? God help us in the last great apostasy.W. S. Ritchie.
