The church is not a substitute for the family, nor for civil society, nor for the State. It cannot realize to fullness its divine mission except through and by means of these institutions organized in perfect freedom and selfcontrol. If these institutions are organized on the basis of another religion—a heathen religion—as, say, the family system of Utah, or the civil society of Hindostan, with its system of castes, or, finally, the despotic state of the Turkish Empire—thus organized, Christianity antagonizes them and tends to remove them. But if by any mistake the church attempts to exercise the functions of the State, and secure the adoption of its dogmas by the aid of the sword, then it fails in its mission and does not extend pure religion, but only its counterfeit.—*W. T. Harris.*
