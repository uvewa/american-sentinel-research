> "District" Secretary, Rev. M. A. Gault, in a report in the *Christian Statesman* of August 11, tells of his attendance at a Prohibition convention at Lake Side Rink, Racine, Wis., at which he "had the privilege of presenting the cause of God in Government here on the same platform with Colonel Bain, and Governor St John." Speaking further of Colonel Bain he says:—

> "He shook my hand warmly as I left the platform, saying how much he sympathized with the National Reform movement. He said he had received a letter some time ago from the editor of the American Sentinel in California, telling him how much mischief there was in our movement, and asking him to write some articles for the Sentinel."
We are most happy to inform Mr. Bain that he is most prodigiously mistaken. We know that Mr. Bain never received a letter from the editor of the American Sentinel, because we happen to know that the editor of the Sentinel never sent him a letter. Nor did the editor of the American Sentinel, nor any person authorized by the editor of the Sentinel, ever ask Colonel Bain to write a single article, much less "s*ome articles* for the Sentinel." We would suggest that the excellent Colonel read his letters a little more carefully.

Further Mr. Gault says of him:—

> "He wrote in reply [to the letter that he didn't get from the editor of the Sentinel] that our country had been drifting devilward long enough, and he was disposed to sympathize with any movement to help it Godward."

Mr. Bain may have written such a letter to somebody; he may have written it to the editor of the Sentinel; but that no such letter was ever received by us is certain. If we had received it we might have said to him that it is true enough that our country has been, and is, "drifting devilward," but whereas now it is only "drifting," the effect of National Reform will be but to set it *full-sail* in that direction.
