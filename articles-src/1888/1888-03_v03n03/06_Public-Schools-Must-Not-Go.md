Two battles are now being fought, the issues of which are vital to the welfare of this republic. Saloons must go and public schools must not. If the Roman Catholic authorities fought saloons, as they do the schools, the country would feel easier. They are now fighting the schools with a vigor and ingenuity worthy of the darkest ages. In this region they seek to break up our system by merely asking for a portion of the public money to use in educating children in their own way. They would kindly permit other religionists to do the same, and thus destroy all common education by making it sectarian. This sacrifice is demanded in order to keep the children from growing up to be infidel and irreligious. They declare that Protestants ought to join with them in this demand, for the sake of protecting their own religious interests.

We cannot for one moment yield to the timid judgment of those Protestants who favor this policy. Roman Catholics mean by "infidelity and irreligion," just what Protestants mean by "religious freedom of opinion and worship." All this sort of thing is called "infidelity" by Romanism and lamented as souldestroying. They hate our public schools just because this common education tends to break down religious distinctions, and ecclesiastical exclusiveness, and all spiritual despotism of every kind whatever. They stigmatize the schools as godless, but their real, practical grievance is that any education which is not positively and persistently Romanist, tends to lessen the moral and spiritual domination of the Roman Church. It is entirely natural and inevitable that they should do all in their power to break down this system of general education, to get a share of the public money to use for their own benefit, as the only way to maintain themselves in this atmosphere of general intelligence and religious freedom.

Is there any reason or justice or expediency why the people should yield to this demand? Are the people of these United States to blame if our system of public education, prepared on the broadest possible principles, working harmoniously with the most heterogeneous of populations, proves to be unfavorable to a foreign religion, whose infallible head, up to the last hour of his authority, ruled with absolute proscription of all religious liberty?

This body of religionists, that never professes respect for others where it dares to reveal its sentiments, comes here to say that our common education is distasteful, that it makes its own progress difficult, that it develops insubordination even among its priests, and that consequently the Government must change its methods, educate its children according to the various religions that prevail in the community, and thus make peace by making Romanists, Spiritualists, Presbyterians, and many other varieties of worshipers.

This is sheer impudence with no element of justice in it. They inform our Government that, representing 200,000,000 of people in Spain, South America, Italy, and other -countries, they do not like our American way of teaching the young. In that it is not Roman teaching, it is irreligious. "Let us teach our children in our own way." In reply, the Government, which is our people, says: "You are at liberty to teach your children just how and when and where you wish. But you cannot have a share of the public money; you cannot use our public buildings; you cannot break up our system; you cannot destroy the power of this Government to give all children born under it a foundation of general teaching which it knows and controls, and which it believes to be most productive of general enlightenment and genuine civil and religious liberty. This system is splendidly adapted to the wants of sixty millions, and it is your misfortune if you have a faith that cannot endure the strain of such an instrument. It is simply monstrous that you should demand in the name of justice and liberty that this Government assist you in bringing up your children in a way that you consider more desirable than theirs." . . .

Our citizens... do not realize how the Romanists who drive *their children out of the schools,* at the same time strain every nerve to get *their teachers into them.* Read the names of the teachers in the public schools of New York, and it is a revelation. If they are indeed "irreligious," then Romanists must be very "irreligious" teachers. When we roused the spirit of the people of this State to such an extent that John Morrisey, the gamblinghouse proprietor and ex-prize-fighter in the assembly, was very glad to withdraw the "Gray Nun" Bill, it was the victory of the people over a Romanist attack on our Normal School.

This bill made a Roman Catholic establishment [20] equal to the Normal School in power to give certificates of qualification as teachers. It not only made the Normal School useless for Romanists, but gave them power to furnish any number of their own candidates for positions. Thus they designed to capture the schools they could not destroy, just as in Pittsburg, Father Tighe became principal of the school his church denounces as "immoral and godless." "Rule or ruin" is the policy now pursued without the slightest attempt at concealment. Their numerical and political strength has increased so vastly that they can afford to scorn secrecy. Politicians of both parties will be rivals for the favor of this mighty machine, which is everywhere quite as much a political power as it is religious. If the masses of our people are not united and alert, before they know it the public-school system will be impaired and crippled. This is one of the great evils now threatening us with the recent vast influx of foreigners. Our schools have been the mills in which the human material of the Nation has been prepared and moulded for American citizenship. Our disorderly, rebellious criminal class are mainly recruited from other sources than our public schools. We are not yet ready to give them up at the dictation of the Papal power. *—N. Y.
