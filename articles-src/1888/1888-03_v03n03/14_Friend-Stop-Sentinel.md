> "Friend, please stop the American Sentinel," was the word that came post haste from Kansas a few days ago. We have not the slightest doubt but that there are many who would like to have us stop the Sentinel, but we cannot gratify them, because there are so very many who write of the Sentinel in a strain similar to the following from a prominent judge in a Southern State: "I read each number that comes, and I think with increasing interest." The Sentinel will not stop.
