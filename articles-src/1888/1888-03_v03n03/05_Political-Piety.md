Mr. Froude tells us that in the age of Julius Caesar, "public men spoke conventionally of Providence, that they might throw on their opponents the odium of impiety." Among the many things in our own day which show a tendency to the same results that followed the age of Caesar, this is not an exception. It is becoming common now for aspiring politicians to make capital for themselves by pretending that their opponents do not show proper respect to God, when they themselves have no more respect for him than has any other worshiper of mammon. A mass-meeting was held lately in San Francisco to work up legislation for the further restriction of Chinese immigration. State Senator T. J. Clunie made the principal speech, and one of his grand arguments against the Chinese being admitted to this country, was, that "they don't worship our God." But they have an excellent reason for that; and that is, *They can't vote.* If only the Chinese could vote we have not the least doubt that many of them would be just as ardent worshipers of the god of the San Francisco politicians as is Mr. Clunie himself.

Another instance is that in which United States Senator John Sherman, in antagonizing President Cleveland's opinions on the tariff, endeavored to throw upon the President "the odium of impiety," by stating that in his annual message to Congress he was so anxious to display his view of the tariff question, that he not only departed from the uniform custom of giving a view of the state of the country and its relations with foreign powers, but even failed to "make any mention of the Supreme Being." We have yet to learn that Senator Sherman's respect for the Supreme Being is any more particularly conspicuous than is President Cleveland's. And we are quite certain that President Cleveland's act in sending a State paper to Congress without any mention of the Supreme Being, is just as compatible with respect for Him, as is Mr. Sherman's effort to make of it political capital with which to influence votes.
