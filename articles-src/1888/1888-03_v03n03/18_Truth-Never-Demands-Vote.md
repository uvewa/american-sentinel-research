Truth never demands a vote. It refuses to go to the poll or to acknowledge majorities. It presents its evidence and claims submission. To attempt to gather truth out of a multitude of errors, by setting them to neutralize each other, is to revive the vain alchemy of the middle ages to turn iron into gold, or to imitate the folly of an old student of prophecy, who gathered some scores of conflicting prophetic dates together, and struck the mean among them in order to reach the true year. *—Horatius Bonar, D. D.*
