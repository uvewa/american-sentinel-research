Not long ago the religious journals of New York were very active in working for the Saturday half-holiday. Now the bank superintendent of the State, in his report to the Legislature, has recommended that the law be so amended as to be limited in its operations to July and August, during which months business in the cities is usually suspended on Saturday afternoons; and the *Independent *says that "a better recommendation would have been a total repeal of the law altogether." It truthfully adds:—

> "The truth is, that the law is really of no service to anybody. The design of the Legislature in passing it was simply to *humbug *the working people, by *seeming* to do something for them, when in fact doing nothing except to their injury."

And that is just the case with all Sunday legislation. If the workingmen allow the Sunday-law advocates to humbug them into thinking that the object of Sunday laws is to benefit them, they will find out the contrary to their sorrow when it is too late to remedy the matter.
