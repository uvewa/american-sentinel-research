Since the Elgin Sunday-law Convention, the Illinois preachers have been enlarging their field of operations. They have issued four petitions: One to the United States Senate, one to the House of Representatives, one each to the railroad and the telegraph companies in the United States, asking for their co-operation. One of their circulars says:—

> "God's trumpet-call to every minister of the gospel, to every Christian and patriotic man and woman, and the public press in these United States, is that they 'advance along the line' against this giant sin of Sabbath [Sunday] desecration, which is sapping the foundations of our republican institutions."

If there is anything in this world that is sapping the foundations of our republican institutions more than is this movement of the churches to wield the power of the State, then we wish somebody would name it. There ought to be a million copies of the March Sentinel distributed at once in Illinois, and ten millions throughout the country besides; it shows what these Illinois preachers are up to, and what will come of it.
