It is not the province of the State to teach religious tenets. Its teaching should be limited to such instruction as will tend to good citizenship, and to fit its wards for the duties of the secular sphere. Clearly it has no right to provide for or allow more than this. For it to *provide* more would be to invade the province of the church. For it to *allow* more would be to open its institutions as an arena for sectarian strife.—*Selected,*
