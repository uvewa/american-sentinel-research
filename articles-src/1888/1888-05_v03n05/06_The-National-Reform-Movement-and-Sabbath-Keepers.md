The editor of *The Outlook and Sabbath Quarterly,* a Seventh-day Baptist journal published at Alfred Center, N. Y., was present at the Ocean Grove National Reform meeting last July, and listened to a paper by Professor Rittenhouse, entitled "Christ and the Sabbath." Being impressed with the soundness of the argument in favor of the Sabbath, the editor of the *Outlook* asked Professor Rittenhouse to make "a statement of the attitude which the National Reform Association assumes, theoretically, toward those who observe the Sabbath, and not the Sunday." Accordingly Mr. Rittenhouse wrote the communication which we present below, followed by the *Outlook's* comments thereon:—-

> "Dickson College, Carlisle, Pa.,  Sept. 10, 1887.

> "Rev. A. H. Lewis, D. D.—*My Dear Sir and Brother: *Your letter of the 8th inst. came duly to hand, containing a request to state the views of the National Reform Association 'concerning the future of Sabbath observance,' 'the theory and purpose of the Association concerning the Sabbath,' and 'the attitude of the Association concerning the duty of the State with reference to the Sunday laws, and their enforcement on different classes.'
> "I am not sure that I am able to represent correctly the views of the Association on these points, and I will therefore only endeavor to state very briefly my own views on the general subject indicated in your letter.
> "The Sabbath as a civil institution rests upon the law of nature as well as the positive law of revelation, and the laws enacted by the State for its maintenance are binding upon the conscience of the Christian citizen, independent of the authority of the decalogue. 'It seems,' says Fairbairn,'as if God, in the appointment of this (Sabbath) law, had taken special precaution against the attempts which he foresaw would be made to get free of the institution, and that on this account he laid its foundation deep in the original famework and constitution of nature.' *—Schaff, the Anglo-American Sabbath.*
> "The Sabbath is at the same time an institution of the State and of the church, but civil government maintains it, not for the sake of the church, but for its own sake; not to secure the specific spiritual ends contemplated by the church, but to secure the legitimate political ends, whether moral or material, contemplated by civil government. The citizen has a right to the civil Sabbath, as Hopkins has shown, 'on the same grounds that he has a right to property, or to anything else,' and 'it belongs to legislation to secure him in the enjoyment of those rights.' *—Law of Love, p. 319.*
> "With reference to the enforcement of the Sunday laws on different classes, it is undoubtedly the right and duty of the State to enforce such laws on all classes, even upon those who hold that another day of the week than Sunday is the Sabbath day according to the Scriptures. There can be only one Sabbath day in the week, and 'the privilege of rest for each is conditioned upon a law of rest for all.' Government, therefore, must decide upon the day, so far as the civil Sabbath is concerned. If the first day is chosen, the religious scruples of the Jews and others who hold sacred the seventh day will have to be disregarded and offended; and if the seventh is made the legal rest day, then the religious scruples of those who hold to the first day will have to be disregarded. There are very many Christians, however, who believe that the Sabbath law as such does not enjoin a particular day of the week; that it requires the observance not of the seventh day, but of every seventh day; that what the Sabbath law does enjoin is the consecration of one-seventh of the time to rest and worship, in a regular alternation of six days of labor, and one day of rest. It is right for the State to recognize the authority of the divine law as at the foundation of the Sabbath law, and, as far as possible, to make the civil Sabbath coincide as to the day with the sacred Sabbath. But the State cannot be expected to achieve the impossible. If the State does not respect the religious scruples of all its citizens, as to the particular day, it is simply because it is not possible to do so where there is a diversity of sentiment on this point. There will always be diversity of sentiment, not only on this, but on all, or nearly all, other questions, political, as well as religious, and Government is bound to come to some decision and to adopt some policy on all matters coming within the political sphere, notwithstanding the religious or political scruples that may be offended thereby. As already stated, the Sabbath is a civil as well as a religious institution, and the right and duty of civil government to maintain the Sabbath rest cannot be questioned. Civil government is not free to decide the question whether or not there shall be a Sabbath; that has been decided by the divine authority, to which States as well as individuals are subject.
> "If the Sabbath is well calculated to secure spiritual ends, and to build up Christian character, at the same time that it secures temporal ends, and promotes good citizenship, this fact furnishes an additional argument in favor of civil Sabbath laws. Government cannot compel a religious observance of the Sabbath, but it can and ought to compel a secular observance of the day, by forbidding all work, so as to secure the privilege of secular rest to all citizens, and the opportunity of spiritual rest to as many as choose to observe the day for worship. To this extent, and in this sense, the civil Sabbath, strictly maintained, becomes a shelter for the holy Sabbath. Those who agree with the State on the particular day will of course have an advantage over those who feel bound to observe some other day; but the State, meanwhile, cannot abandon the civil Sabbath because of this inequality growing out of a diversity of sentiment.
> "The Seventh-day Sabbatarians suffer loss, because they are forced to rest two days in the week; but other citizens are compelled to submit to similar disabilities on account of their religious scruples. Take, for example, that most excellent class of citizens, the Friends, or Quakers. They religiously hold what are known as peace principles; and so long as armies are maintained, and conscriptions are enforced, and war taxes are levied by the Government, the Friends are forced to suffer, not only in mind and conscience, but also in property and political privilege; for they can never aspire to the chief magistracy of the nation, or wear the honors of the army and navy, or enjoy any of the emoluments of the military service of the Government.
> "But I am not aware that the Friends are disposed to charge the Government with intolerance because the laws are impartially enforced, or because they are left to the normal consequences of their religious scruples. They suffer patiently, and in the spirit of true martyrdom they "witness" in favor of their principles. Under a Christian Government that bears the sword in the name of the divine authority, the Friends offer a passive resistance in the name of conscience.
> "Of a like character, although of less degree, are the hardships which the enforcement of the Sunday law imposes upon those who believe in the seventh-day Sabbath. They are compelled by the State to rest on the first day, and conscience compels them to rest on the seventh. The State certainly cannot yield, for the civil Sabbath must not be abandoned; and all that the seventh-day Sabbatarians can do is to stand by their religious convictions, to suffer for conscience' sake, to maintain and advocate the truth as it has been given them to see the truth, and to wait for the time when the Government may change the day so as to conform to their views. But if the day should not be changed, they cannot justly complain that the Government is guilty of intolerance in enforcing the Sunday laws.
> "Such, in brief, are the views I hold on this question, and which I believe to be in substantial accord with at least a considerable number of those who are in sympathy with the National Reform Association. I may add that the State should maintain Christian institutions, not merely because they are Christian, but because they are serviceable to society, and preeminently adapted to secure the great ends for which Governments exist. Yours very truly,
"A. Rittenhouse."

> "Professor Rittenhouse claims that the State must establish a 'civil Sabbath;' that this should coincide, so far as possible, with the 'sacred Sabbath,' and that the authority for establishing a 'civil Sabbath' is the divine law concerning the 'sacred Sabbath.' He further states that since there must be differences of opinion on all questions, the State cannot recognize 'the religious scruples of all its citizens as to the particular day,' [36] but nevertheless it must compel the observance of the 'civil Sabbath.' All these propositions are self-contradictory when applied to Sunday. If the State ought to enforce the observance of the Sabbath according to the divine law, it must enforce the observance of the seventh day of the week. It is further asserted: 'There can be only one Sabbath day in the week, and the privilege of rest for each is conditioned upon a law of rest for all. Government, therefore, must decide upon the day, so far as the civil Sabbath is concerned.' Here the doctrine that any one day in seven meets the demands of the law, is ignored, and the proposition is put forth that the Government having chosen a day—for whatever reason *—that day and that only* must be recognized and enforced by the civil law. It has been frequently said within the last few years that 'the privilege of rest for each is conditioned upon a law of rest for all.' This statement is disproved every week. The existing Sunday laws are but slightly enforced, and while, in a certain sense, rest from labor is general, Sabbath-keeping in any religious sense is by no means general; nevertheless, the few who desire to rest religiously on Sunday, do so with but slight if any interruption or disturbance. This proposition is farther disproved by the fact that Sabbath-keeping Christians and Sabbath-keeping Jews have been compelled by the practice of the majority for centuries to rest in the midst of the great tide of worldly business and amusement. Yet, in spite of all this, their rest has been quite as nearly complete and as truly religious as that of those who observe the first day. They not only rest without the authority of the [civil] law, but surrounded by all the disabilities which come from being ignored by the law, and from being compelled, by the same law, to rest upon the first day of the week.

> "Here comes the crucial point in Mr. Rittenhouse's position, which, being analyzed, is seen to be opposed to the fundamental doctrines of Christianity, of republicanism, and of freedom of conscience. According to Mr. Rittenhouse, the State must legislate upon Sunday-observance in accordance with the opinion of the majority, and must wholly ignore the minority. If, as now, the civil rest day be fixed upon the first day of the week, Jews and Sabbath-keeping Christians must suffer. If by any turn in the wheel, the civil law should fix upon the seventh day, then all who observe the first day must suffer. The fundamental error in this theory is, that the civil and religious rights of the minority are not to be respected. Being in the minority, they must patiently suffer for conscience' sake. This is the same doctrine which drove Baptists and Quakers from New England, which burned dissenters at Smithfield, which butchered the Waldenses, and so backward along the line of religious proscription and persecution, until we reach the fountain of this theory, where it springs from the genius of the pagan State. Professor Rittenhouse's proposition is only an indirect way of punishing those who hold to an *illegal* religion.
> "The weakness of Mr. Rittenhouse's position, as well as its injustice, is further evinced in the repetition of the popular fallacy, that there is, or can be, a 'civil Sabbath.' The State may rightfully establish holidays, upon which cessation from labor is permitted—possibly in great emergencies when the interests of the commonwealth are clearly at stake it might compel such cessation as 'a war measure.' But to assume that the State has the right to compel a weekly cessation from legitimate business upon mere hygienic grounds, is, to say the least, a point settled neither by experience nor by the deductions of science. If it be claimed that the fourth commandment indicates this necessity, we agree heartily; but it is begging the question to say that therefore the State has a right to compel this rest. The blessings which the fourth commandment implies come through obedience *from religious* motives—conscience toward God. They cannot rise from physical rest unassociated with the religious element. There are thousands of evils which obedience to the law of God would prevent in individual life, and in the State, which can be prevented only by the enthronement of the divine law in the hearts of individuals, and thus in the Nation. Cessation from business at the behest of civil law has never risen above holidayism. In the matter of Sabbath-keeping, as upon every other religious questions, the only province of the civil law is the protection of conscience. Every man should be protected equally with every other man, on whatever day he may feel it his duty to rest, that he may sabbatize. If unavoidable difficulties come to him because he is in the minority, he must bear them; but the State has no right to impose still greater difficulties, by compelling him, against his conscience, to cease from legitimate labor on another day. It is practically true under the operation of the laws of the State of New Jersey that a large share of the business men of the church of which the writer is pastor, are compelled to lose one-seventh of their time from legitimate business.
> "We do not believe that Professor Rittenhouse, nor those associated with him in the opinions he expresses, have fully considered the position they have taken, either as to its logical results, or as to its intrinsic injustice. They see Sunday observance not only endangered, but being destroyed. Deluded by the hope that the civil law can prevent this, their proposition is to compel all classes to express at least an outward regard by cessation from labor.
> "The attempted comparison of the position of the Friends as non-combatants, and Sabbath-keepers, is not a just one. Necessary defense of the nation against foreign foes or internal disruption, constitutes an emergency to which the Sabbath law yields, upon the ground of self-defense. Such an emergency— we trust it may never arise again in the history of our nation—bears no just analogy to a religious practice connected with every week of life; and it is scarcely less than ludicrous to speak of the voluntary refusal to seek the emoluments of the army and navy as a misfortune, or to call this a disability under the law.
> "We do not question the Christian spirit and purpose of those men represented by Professor Rittenhouse and his theory. We impute neither conscious injustice nor unkindness to them. Having adopted the false theory that the State must compel obedience in religious matters, and being unconsciously blinded by that sense of power which the majority always feels, they propose to trample upon the conscientious rights of the minority, because they can. The great mass of those who violate the Sunday laws are not Sabbathkeepers. Many of them are defiantly irreligious. They do not disregard Sunday because they have a religious regard for the Sabbath, but because they have no religious regard for anything. The wickedness which they seek to do on Sunday as a holiday, should be restrained by civil law—notably, liquor-selling and the resultant rioting. [And so they should be on every other day as well.] But if, as Mr. Rittenhouse claims, the civil law ought to accord with the divine law of the sacred Sabbath —which divine law cannot apply to Sunday— there is no shadow of pretense for forbidding legitimate business on Sunday. If any logical basis can be found for legislation against legitimate business on Sunday, it must be based upon scientific deductions relative to the welfare of the State, without regard to religious considerations.
> "Mr. Rittenhouse is consistent with the facts of history when he insists upon the enforcement of Sunday laws on religious grounds. All Sunday legislation has sprung from the religious sentiment. The pagans 'venerated' the day as a religious duty owed to the god of the sun. In the Middle Ages, the ruling authorities claimed the right to enforce religious regard for Sunday, and many other days, because similar regard for the Sabbath had been required under the Jewish theocracy. The Puritan theory, which formed the basis of the special legislation in our own country, claimed religious regard for Sunday, both as commemorating the resurrection of Christ, and by the transfer of the authority of the fourth commandment to the first day of the week. There would have been no Sunday legislation in the past had it not sprung from religious sentiment. Hence it is correct to insist upon the enforcement of the Sunday laws, if at all, upon religious grounds. It is this fact which makes Mr. Rittenhouse's positions illiberal and destructive to freedom of conscience. His propositions are more elegantly expressed than were the earlier colonial laws which empowered the civil officers to break into any house where they suspected 'pestiferous Quakers,' and Baptists, or other *ungodly* assemblies, to be in worship, and to arrest and punish all found thus doing. The civilization of our time forbids the repetition of such legislation, but the exact spirit which prompted those enactments lurks in the proposition of Mr. Rittenhouse to compel the minority to obey the Sunday laws with reference to legitimate business, without regard to their conscientious regard for the Sabbath. If the [37] majority may compel observance to the Sunday laws as a religious duty, they may with equal propriety compel obedience to every outward requirement of religion represented by the majority. This would carry all Protestants back to the bosom of the mother church, obliterate all outward schisms, and usher in the millennium, *according to civil law.*
> "We are glad to protest against the injustice which the view presented by Professor Rittenhouse would do the Sabbath-keepers— Jews and Christians. It is quite enough that custom and the influence of the majority lay unavoidable burdens upon them. It is consonant with neither Christianity nor republicanism to formulate enactments which legalize these disabilities, or add to them. Sabbath-keepers do not hold to the Sabbath as a matter of convenience, as many avowedly hold to Sunday; much less is it a 'whim of sectarianism.' They seek to obey the law of God without modification or evasion. The civil regulations and ceremonial excesses which were peculiar to Judaism are discarded by Sabbath-keeping Christians, in accordance with the example and teaching of Christ, the Lord of the Sabbath.
> "Thus standing, we cannot cease to assert our right to full recognition before the civil law, and doubly so when it is claimed that civil enactments should coincide with the law of God. Freedom of conscience is not the exclusive right of the majority, and it is but the dust of sophistry and of special pleading to say that this is not assailed when the civil law prohibits a man from legitimate business on a day when God commands him to labor, under the plea that the majority must not be disturbed in the observance of a legalized but unscriptural institution. Men may say, patronizingly, that 'religious proscription is not intended,' but the fact remains that it is established and defended by several of the existing Sunday laws; and if the theory of Professor Rittenhouse is the theory of the National Reform movement, it is none too soon to call a halt along that line."
