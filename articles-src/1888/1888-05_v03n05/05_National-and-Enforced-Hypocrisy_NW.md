Article 6 of the constitution of the National Reform Association, says of their proposed religious amendment to the Constitution of the United States:—

> "It is necessary to maintain our present Christian institutions against the assaults of secularism and infidelity."

Upon this point Dr. Crosby says (June, 1887) : "If the State is to furnish religious instruction, there is another thing that it will have to furnish, and that is the inquisition. That will be the legitimate outcome of religious instruction by the State. If it is going to teach religion, it will have to compel the people to receive that religion, and in order to do that it will have to have the strong arm of the inquisition. But not only that, in our attempt to find out what sort of religion you are going to have taught in your schools, and what kind of teachers you are to get to instruct, you have got to deny and destroy the foundation of American independence. The foundation of it all before God is individual, independent, and mutual equality. And no mere majority clothes any man in that majority with power to say, 'You must be taught my religion.' Of all forms of wrong which men have suffered from each other, none have been less reasonable, or more merciless and unrelenting, than those of religious zeal armed with civil power. There is no darker chapter in the history of governments than that which chronicles their misdeeds in the attempt to administer and propagate religion. The attempt is a horrid human tyranny begun, and every step of the process is that tyranny continued."

No one man ever injured the cause of Christ as did Constantine, by incorporating Christianity into his Government as a political factor. Dr. Dowling says: "Many of the errors, indeed of several centuries, the fruit of vain philosophy, paved the way for the events which followed; but the hindrance was not effectually removed until Constantine, the emperor, on professing himself a Christian, undertook to convert the kingdom of Christ into a kingdom of this world, by exalting the teachers of Christianity to the state of affluence, grandeur, and influence, in the empire, as had been enjoyed by pagan priests and secular officers of the State. Professed ministers of Jesus having now a wide field opened to them for gratifying their lust of power, and wealth, and dignity, the connection between the Christian faith and the cross was at an end." *—History of Romanism, p. 29.*

The National Reform Association would fain secure a similar state of things in the United States.

In their Article 4 they say:—

The amendment "is necessary in order to secure a standard and guaranty of moral qualification in civil rulers, which is now wanting in our constitution."

They imagine that by incorporating Christianity into the constitution, so that all must profess it in taking the oath of office, they will then be known to be Christians. But what more will it do than bring to the front a horde of hypocrites? Will unprincipled politicians and office-seekers hesitate to profess Christianity for the sake of office? If we *must* have infidels in office, who would not prefer an honest, outspoken one, to a sheepskin-covered hypocrite?

Rev. Mr. Sommerville, in the *Christian Nation* (July 14, 1886), says:—

> "Civil rulers owe it to their supreme Lord and to society to encourage and to stimulate the church in its work of faith and labor of love, and, when it may be necessary, to give pecuniary aid to its ministers, that the gospel may be preached in every part of their dominion and to all classes, without respect of persons, and to take public money to teach principles, enforce laws, and introduce customs to which many members of the community are conscientiously opposed."

All the real success Christianity ever had was without the aid of civil government, and it has shone brightest and purest, even when worldly governments were arrayed against it. Then God's protecting care and power were most manifest. Its history has been, that in proportion as human governments have made it a political factor, it has been corrupted by designing men professing it as a stepping-stone to ambitious attainments. Nothing could injure the cause so much as to make it popular in such a worldly sense. Has Christianity [35] lost its inherent power to compete with sin? Has Satan gained such a victory over Christ that he must now accept the offer made him by the devil on the mountain, in order to save his cause from destruction? This would be to enthrone Satan as king of the nation instead of Christ.

In a pamphlet entitled "Aims and Operations of the National Reform Association," we read: "The object of this society shall be to maintain existing Christian features in the American Government and to secure such an amendment to the Constitution of the United States as will indicate that this is a Christian nation, and place all the Christian laws, institutions, and usages of our Government on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land."

A very small minority of the inhabitants of the United States are true Christians. Will voting Christianity into the Constitution make them such? If so, then all we have to do is to show our hands in the affirmative, and the whole nation is converted! Christians are not made that way; but hypocrites may be. If the Constitution be so changed, then all who swear allegiance to it will profess Christianity, and only such can hold office under it. Thus a premium will be offered for the commission of moral perjury.

If all the "Christian institutions and usages" are incorporated into the Constitution and laws, they must be enforced by penalties, even to the shedding of blood. What will this be but compelling people by police clubs, handcuffs, incarcerations, etc., to *pretend* to be Christians; even those who hate the name? Again, who are to decide what kind of "institutions and usages" are to be enforced? Of course those who take the lead in bringing this change about will expect to have that matter in charge. Perhaps they will, and perhaps not. There is another party whose cooperation they are seeking, which will not rest till they get the control in their hands; and then these so-called reformers may not fare any better than the rest of us.

Political matters are in the hands of politicians, and no amendments or oaths will prevent those who itch for office from putting themselves in an attitude to get it, and they will manage affairs to suit the wishes of the class which will have most influence at the polls. Whatever political party is in power will be the one to decide what the Bible teaches. When these things come to exist, what else will it be but Church and State, or Christianity and State, which is virtually the same thing? What essential difference will there be whether *one* denomination is thus united with the Government, or half a dozen? Those outside this circle will not fare any better for being ruled by an *aristocracy* of churches instead of one. Then, perpetual strife will be sure to follow among these dominant churches as to which shall have the pre-eminence. Besides, they will not be satisfied with merely what they now contend for. These changes will suggest and necessitate many others. The W. C. T. U. started with one reform in view, and forty more have been added as growing out of this one. Our forefathers were wise in adding that "first amendment" to the Constitution, and it should, by all means, be sustained, if Christian liberty is to be preserved in our Nation.—*N. Wardner, D. D.*
