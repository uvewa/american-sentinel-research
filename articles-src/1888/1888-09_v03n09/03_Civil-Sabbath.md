# Civil Sabbath

The *Christian Statesman* has sent us a circular giving reasons why that paper is to be commended. One of these reasons is:—

> "Because it advocates a *civil* as well as a church Sabbath."

But there is no such thing as a civil Sabbath. The original, supreme, and only Sabbath law—the fourth commandment—says explicitly of the Sabbath, that it is "the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." It is not the Sabbath of any civil government, it is the Sabbath of the Lord. He calls it, "M*y* holy day." Christ has commanded us to render to God that which is God's, while we render to Cesar that which is Cesar's. The Sabbath being the Lord's day, it is to be rendered to him and not to Cesar. Civil government can never of right have anything to do with directing the observance of the Sabbath. Whenever it undertakes to do so, it puts itself in the place of God, and usurps the authority of God, both in such legislation, and by invading the sacred precincts of the conscience. The Lord alone "is the Author and Lord of conscience, and no power on earth has a right to stand between God and the conscience. A violation of this divine law written in the heart is an assault upon the majesty of God and the image of God in man."
