# What Constitutes a Catholic School?

The question is, What do Catholics include in the doctrine of faith and morals? And we are at no difficulty to answer that that church teaches, among other things, that Church and State are not to be separated, and that the church is rightfully superior to the government of all States. This is one department of Catholic faith, as expounded by an infallible church. It is not to be supposed that all the minutiæ of faith are imparted to children in the parochial schools, but let them be fully indoctrinated with the idea of the infallibility of the church in their youth, and then let the application of the doctrine to their conduct as citizens be made at some later period of life, and there can be no doubt that, if they are good Catholics, they will decide that their first allegiance is due to the Catholic Church rather than to their country.

There is no difficulty about a good Catholic being also a good patriot so long as no question of the supremacy of the Church or State is involved; but let that question arise, let the issue be fairly made whether in these United States the Government shall control the Catholic Church or the Catholic Church shall control the Government, and every good Catholic is bound to do his best to bring the Government under the control of the church. These and similar consequences flow logically and irresistibly from the doctrine of the infallibility of the church, in connection with the Catholic theory of "faith and morals," and we must understand that a Catholic school is an institution where the seed is sown that will infallibly produce this fruit.

It becomes a matter of interest to us to have a clear understanding of these matters, in view of the fact that the demand is persistently made for the maintenance of these schools by the public, and the public have a right to the fullest information on this point, that they may intelligently determine whether they wish to pay taxes for the support of such instructions.—*J. Rockwell, in Christian Union.*
