# The Political Value of Religion.

Judge Hagans, of the Supreme Court of Cincinnati, in delivering his opinion in the case of Minor and others *vs.* the Board of Education of Cincinnati and others, said: "In a word, it is the *political value* of religion, morality, and knowledge which the State proposes to secure for its varied purposes, and that only." This utterance was preceded by an extended quotation from an article by Dr. Seelye, which appeared in the *Bibliotheca Sacra, *Vol. XIII, No. 52. In this article Dr. Seelye says that "the State has its own end," and that it "uses religion as a means to this end; but religion itself is never an end with the State. Everything relating to the moral and religious life of its subjects is of interest to the State only so far as the State can use it to its own ends." Again he says: "With the State religion is a means." He says again: "There are temporal and earthly interests for the individual, and it is to subserve these that there is a State, a community, among men. These interests are undoubtedly more perfectly secured through the agency of some religion, and hence the proper and necessary connection of religion with the State. But in this connection religion is ever the servant, never the sovereign. It is to be used to secure some end"—namely, some temporal end, that comes within the province of the State. On this ground we understand Dr. Seelye to hold to a legitimate "connection of the State with religion, and the duty of the State to maintain its religion," while he disclaims any right on its part to resort to persecution.

The substance of this theory, as adopted by Judge Hagans, and more fully explained by Dr. Seelye, seems to be this: The State may and should incorporate religion into its own being as a part of its public law; not as an end, or on account of what religion is in itself, considered as a spiritual system, but solely on account of what the State can do with it as the means of promoting the civilization, improvement, and good earthly order of the body politic. The State can make use of it as a "servant," and hence, in this character, should maintain it. Its "political value" brings it within the purview of civil government.

This theory is as old as the efforts of human thought to vindicate the establishment and maintenance of religion by the civil power. There is nothing in it which limits it to Christianity in either the Catholic or the Protestant form, and it has not been so limited. It applies to any religious system, whether pagan or Christian, true or false. Any such system, which, in the judgment of the State, can be made useful for the attainment of its temporal ends, may, as the means thereof, be legalized, adopted, and supported by the State. Almost any religion is, in its social effects, better than blank atheism; and, hence, it might be used by the State as a means, rather than have a nation of pure atheists, especially as no religion has ever been so bad as not to contain at least some rays of truth. Of course, it would be better for the State to adopt the true system; but, in its absence, it will be better to put its stamp on any system, and use it for State purposes, rather than be wholly without religion.

Now, in order to give this theory the benefit of the most favorable application, let us understand the term religion to mean Christianity. The case will then stand thus: The State may and should establish a connection between itself and Christianity; not because Christianity is true, not because it is a divine system in its authority, not on account of its relation to the spiritual duties and immortal interests of men, but solely on the ground of its *temporal* utility. Being an existing system known to the people, it is good for this purpose—just as revenue laws, currency laws, laws of debt and credit, patent laws, commercial laws, police regulations, courts of justice, State prisons, and, indeed, all the ordinary appliances of civil government, are good to secure the material and social prosperity of the people. The State may, hence, maintain and use it as one of the wheels in its complex machinery, on the same principle that it maintains and uses other wheels to run its own system. Not what Christianity is, but what the State can get out of it for temporal purposes, is the single thing to be considered.

It is hardly necessary to say that Christ and his apostles did not preach the gospel upon any such theory. They made no mention of it as the "servant" of the State. They presented it as God's supernatural interposition for the salvation of individual sinners. What the State should gain or lose by it was not their question. Salvation, and not State utility, was their grand idea. They did not concern themselves with the relations of the gospel to Cesar, but rather with its relations to God and sinners against his law. They preached repentance toward God and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and warned men to flee from the wrath to come. There is a vast distance between the conception of Christianity as preached by its Author and his apostles and the conception of it as a piece of State machinery, sanctioned and sustained by the State on account of its "political value," or as the means of attaining a purely temporal end.

Let the State frankly enunciate the theory, and, hence, say that it uses Christianity as a mere instrument for State ends; and let the people, including the children in the public school, both understand and accept the theory, and who believes that the system would then have any power to gain these ends? No one ever was and no one ever will be made a Christian on the ground of State utility. No man ever made a prayer to God as the means of turning himself into a good citizen. A truly pious man will be a good citizen; but the motives that make him pious rise infinitely above the range of citizenship. The State can successfully work the theory of "political value" only by being a hypocrite, pretending one thing while seeking another.

If a general should hold morning and evening prayers with his army, or have religious lectures delivered to his soldiers, simply to make them better *fighters* in the day of battle, they would only need to understand the *sham *to treat the whole thing with contempt. Religion cannot be brought down to the level of State strategy or fighting strategy, and yet retain its power as religion. At this level it has no value for either purpose. The moment we make it the means of an end immeasurably less than itself, and so regard it, we destroy its power as religion. The man who is religious for the sake of making money is not religious at all; and so the State that uses the Christian religion simply for its "political value" adopts a theory that cannot survive its own exposure. Let the State by all means put the theory among the *esoteric *doctrines which are not to be known. Statesmen may perhaps be admitted into the secret; but it will not do to give it to the common people, and especially it will not do to tell the children in the public school that they are trained in religion and its duties in order to promote the temporal ends for which the State exists.

The theory, moreover, involves all the perils to religious liberty which ally themselves with the system that makes the regulation of religious belief and practice one of the *ends* of civil government. The distinction between the two theories may be very nicely worked out in an essay; yet, if the State may establish a connection between itself and religion as a means to State ends, then it may equally decide what religion it will so use—whether Christianity or some other system—and, having settled this point, then it is equally privileged to determine upon the methods by which it will sustain and apply the chosen system. The power to use Christianity as a means implies the power of employing all the means of using it. Whether, then, the State will simply teach the religion it uses for temporal ends, or enforce it by pains and penalties, how far it will tolerate other religions, to what extent it will tax the people for the support of its own system, and by what rules it will regulate the administration thereof—these and the like questions will be answered according to the bigotry or liberality of those who enact and apply the laws. [71] The fatal step is taken by conceding that the State has any jurisdiction in the premises, whether religion be viewed as a means or an end.

The voice of history is that all such deposits of power with civil government, whether as a means or otherwise, are exceedingly dangerous to the liberties of the people. No small part of the oppressions which have cursed mankind may be traced, directly or indirectly, to the administration or regulation of religion by State authority. Their justification has been State necessity or church necessity, or both put together. Even Christianity has never been able to enter into any alliance with the civil power without receiving damage and doing damage. Many pages of its history are stained with the blood of martyrs slain in order to maintain its authority and put down heresy. The framers of our national Government were eminently wise in making all organic connection between religion and that Government, upon any theory or for any purpose, and, hence, all disabilities, proscriptions, or persecutions on religious grounds, constitutionally impossible. There are no consequences in the way of evil attaching themselves to this doctrine in practice that in the magnitude of the evil will at all compare with the consequences of the opposite doctrine.

Christianity is a divinely-given system of religion, and, hence, authoritative over the individual conscience; yet there does not exist on all the face of the earth any civil Government that has the right for any purpose to administer this authority. The assumption of the right is an act of tyranny, and every exercise thereof is simply the continuance of that tyranny. When Massachusetts, as was the fact prior to 1833, made every citizen taxable for the support of the *Protestant* religion, whether he was a Protestant or not, her constitution in this respect bore the distinctive mark of religious despotism. When, as was the fact prior to 1821, no person in Massachusetts was eligible to the office of governor, lieutenant-governor, or counselor, or senator, or representative in the legislature, unless he upon oath declared his belief in the religion adopted and sanctioned by the State, then the same feature marked her constitution. Such provisions are virtually persecuting, no matter upon what theory they are defended.

Those who talk about the "political value" of religion as a reason why the State should maintain and teach it, would do well to remember that Christianity has uniformly made its largest contribution to the State when left to depend upon the *voluntary* efforts of its friends, unconstrained and unregulated except by the law of Christ. Its brightest pages are the ones written when such has been the fact, and its darkest pages are those written when the reverse has been true. What the State really wants for its own good is the elevating and purifying power of Christianity in the hearts of the people; and all history shows that in reference to this end the State can do nothing so wise for itself as *simply to do nothing* and leave the work of maintenance and propagation to other and more appropriate agencies. It has always proved itself to be a poor preacher of the gospel, and quite often a worse theologian. It never did the work well, and it never can, because it is not well adapted to the work.

The Bible speaks of Christians, and not of the State, as the visible kingdom of God, and as the habitation of God through the Spirit. To the former, and not the latter, Christ gave the preaching and propagating commission, and never said a word implying that the civil power, as such, was to be called into his service. The simple truth is that the church, composed of His friends and inspired with holy zeal in His cause, holding in her hands the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, and, without any State battalions or State tax-gatherers, assailing the citadels of sin and error—yes, the church, unlicensed and unpatronized by the State, yet strong in argument, patient in effort, persuasive in love, and, above all, having the assurance of divine help—constitutes the effective soldiery in this warfare. It can make more converts than the State can, and make better ones. Christianity, in itself, in its own appointments, in the inspirations which it imparts and the laws which it prescribes, contains all the necessary instrumentalities for its own diffusion; and the State can add nothing thereto with any advantage.

Granting, then, as we most cheerfully do, the great "political value" of the Christian religion as the means of producing good government, we come to a conclusion entirely different from that drawn by Judge Hagans and substantially drawn by Dr. Seelye. The surest way to realize this value is to leave the spiritual agencies of Christianity entirely to the voluntary, the self-imposed, and self-directed efforts of its friends. Let them build their own churches, choose and support their own ministers, and, subject to the rules of good public order, manage their affairs according to their own discretion. Let them replenish their own money-chest and disburse their own free-will-offerings. Let them organize as many religious schools as they choose, and in those schools teach what seems to them good, whether on the Sabbath or the week day, and then let them pay the expenses thereof. Let the State afford to them impartial protection, and stop there. This gives Christian truth, and its friends a fair and open field, without patronage and without State resistance. More would be bad policy, even if we concede that the State has a right to do more. By doing more it would lose rather than gain.—*Samuel T. Spear, D. D., in Religion and the State.*
