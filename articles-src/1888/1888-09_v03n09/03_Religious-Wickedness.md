# Religious Wickedness.

While so many professed Protestants are courting the favor of the Catholic Church, it is timely to consider the logical conclusion to be drawn from such a course, and the true nature of National religion, as represented by the Papacy, and advocated by the National Reformers of the United States.

One of two things is truth, beyond the possibility of contradiction, namely: Either the Roman Church is a great apostasy from genuine Christianity, and utterly antichristian, or, otherwise, the Reformation under Luther, Melancthon, Zwingle, Calvin, etc., was a schism, an apostasy from the true church, and entirely inexcusable. To advance the idea that the Catholic Church is a truly Christian body, is to openly condemn the work of Luther and his co-laborers.

The words of a certain Christian writer of Switzerland, recently uttered, are true: “Protestants there are, but Protestantism is dead.” As a system, representing a distinct profession of faith, and represented by nations or large religious bodies, Protestantism has passed away. Fifty years ago Protestants could not have been persuaded that such a change in the religious world could possibly take place in a single generation. But the change has come, and those peoples who have been most determined in their Protestantism, are now most forward to show their zeal in defending the standing of the Pope and *his church.*

The motto of the Sentinel is: “Corrupted freemen are the worst of slaves.” Akin to this sentiment we may declare the following: “Perverted Christianity is the worst form of error.” The fact has often been noticed that religious wars are the most cruel and sanguinary; religious persecution is the most bitter and relentless. If we trace the history of the Romish Church, its Inquisition, its *auto da fe, *its ingenuity of tortures, we shall find a parallel to its barbarities only amongst the savages of the forests. Rome, in its purely civil form, was marked by its cruelty and thirst for human blood; but under its nationalized Christian form it was still more iron-hearted.

But it is not our purpose at present to trace the history of the Papacy, or to repeat the indictment presented by Luther and others of his time. We only call attention to the fact, and ask all to candidly examine [67] it, that either the Papal system is a gross apostasy, or the Reformation of the sixteenth century was an inexcusable schism. We are compelled to affirm the first part of the proposition; they who are petting the Papacy, as the leading men of the large denominations in America are doing to-day, are in effect denouncing the work of Luther and Melancthon.

But we do not indict the individuals composing that church as being, in the aggregate, sinners above the rest of mankind. The indictment lies against the system under which they acted. Under a similar system, others have followed their example; and under like circumstances others would yet do the same.

National Christianity is a perversion of Christianity, and as such it carries in its bosom, inherent in its nature, all the evils that have cropped out in the history of the Papacy. The principle was incorporated into the early religious systems of New England, and the cruelties of Salem were the result. The complacency with which religious bigots look upon and speak of the sufferings of those who hold a belief differing from their own, is enough to shock the sensibilities of the heathen.

A book published in London, in 1661, entitled “Heresiography,” furnishes a notable example. It was written by “Ephraim Pagitt, late minister of St. Edmonds, Lombard Street.” What must be the heart of a professed minister of the gospel who can write in the following strain?

OF ANABAPTISTS.

“7. *How Christian princes have suppressed these sectaries, and especially how they have been punished in England.*

> “As you have heard of their detestable and blasphemous errors, so I propose to speak a word or two of the severe punishments inflicted upon those wicked sectaries.

> “Anabaptism continued in Germany in its vigor, not much above ten years, they were destroyed and suppressed by the Christian magistrates; at Frankbus there were slain about five thousand of them, and three hundred executed with Muncer; at Nuremburg also a great number was slain; at Zurick they drowned them that were rebaptized; at Vienne they did the like; at Passow many were burned and drowned; in the Low Countries at Amsterdam, Leyden, Harlem, and in all other places else, they were severely punished. Pontanus writeth of the destruction of 150,000 persons.
> “The Christian princes and magistrates never left off burning, drowning, and destroying them, till their remainder was contemptible. A remnant of them came to England in two ships, where they have been lurking. They came hither about the year 1535. In the year 1538 we read of them in our Chronicles, viz., upon the 24 day of Novem., in the said year, four Dutch Anabaptists bare fagots at Paul’s Cross, and again of the burning of two Dutch Anabaptists in Smithfield the 27 of November.
> “Again of two Dutch Anabaptists burnt, in the highway beyond Southwark, leading to Newington, Anno 1539. Again upon Easter day, 1575, of a congregation of Dutch Anabaptists discovered in a house, without the bars at Algate, of whom twenty-seven were taken of them, four recanted at Paul’s Cross, the 25 day of May, in form following:—
> “Whereas, I, T. R. H., being seduced by the devil, the spirit of error, and by false teachers, have fallen into most damnable and detestable errors, namely, “1. That Christ took not flesh of the substance of the Virgin Mary.
> “2. That the infants of the faithful ought not to be baptized.
> “ 3. That a Christian man may not be a magistrate, or bear the sword or office of authority.
> “4. That it is not lawful for a Christian man to take an oath?’
Here follows the form of recantation, and the profession they were compelled to make, and the record continues:—

> “Anno 1575, in the seventeenth year of Queen Elizabeth, of blessed memory, one man and ten women, Dutch Anabaptists, were in the consistory of Paul’s, condemned to be burnt in Smithfield, but after great pains taken with them, only one woman was converted, and the other banished the land.

> “The 22 of July in the same year, two Dutchmen, Anabaptists, were burnt in Smithfield, who died in great horror, crying and roaring: this was the entertainment that these sectaries had in times past.”
Go where you will, look through all history, and you will find that this spirit always accompanies the enforcement of religion. And we need not wait for a National religion to be set up to have this spirit generated; it is the presence of this spirit that calls for and establishes National religion. Where the Spirit of Christ is; where the meek and tender spirit of genuine Christianity exists; where men pity the erring, and strive to fulfill the divine requirement to love their neighbors as themselves, there can be no enforcement of religion, no lording it over the consciences of others.

This spirit of persecution for differences of religious belief is strongly manifesting itself in the utterances of the self-styled National Reformers. Already they complacently declare what shall be the fate of those who “interfere with my faith,” or dare to have a faith and practice not in all things consistent with their views of State religion. They talk of disfranchising non-conformists, with all the coolness of inquisitors who already had their victims in their power. And, strange to say, but few of the people take the alarm, though they can see the spirit of persecution spreading, and the idea of a State-enforced religion everywhere being received with favor.

Mr. Robert Robinson, the able Baptist historian, of Cambridge, England, in his “Ecclesiastical Researches,” speaking of the action of Leo III., and of the Papacy as a system, said:—

> “Dominion over conscience’ is antichrist anywhere. At Rome antichrist is of age, a sovereign, and wears a crown; at the meanest meeting-house if the same kind of tyranny be, antichrist is a beggar’s baby at the breast, but as conscience everywhere is a throne of God, so an usurper of his throne is antichrist anywhere.”—*Pp. 172, 173.*

And again he used the following most truthful and forcible language:—

> “Religion neither is, nor can be, forced; and there is no danger in allowing it to be free. Happy are the States which provide for a free exercise of religion! Happier still are they that confine the civil magistrate to civil affairs, and let religion wholly alone.”— *P. 176.*

But a little over a century ago there was a terrible struggle in North America to establish civil liberty. The struggle for religious liberty in the United States is yet before us. People imagine that it was established with civil liberty; but signs and events are proving that it yet stands on a very slender footing.J. H. W.
