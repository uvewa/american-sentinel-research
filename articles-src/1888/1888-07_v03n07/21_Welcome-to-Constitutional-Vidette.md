We heartily welcome to our table the *American Constitutional Vidette,* published monthly by the Mississippi Valley Publishing Company, Beauregard, Miss. We all the more heartily welcome it because it works in the same line as does the American Sentinel— "the defense of the Constitution as it is, and to battle earnestly for civil and religious liberty." It also is "uncompromisingly opposed to anything tending toward a union of Church and State, either in name or in fact, let it come from whatever source it may." Here is our neighbor, we are not a bit jealous; would to God they were all prophets.
