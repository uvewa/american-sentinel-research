In 1829 the United States Senate told the Sunday-law petitioners that they then already enjoyed "all that Christians ought to ask at the hands of any Government—protection from all molestation in the exercise of their religious sentiments." This is just as true now as it was then. It is also true of these, and now, as it was of those political bishops of the fourth century, that they seek "not protection for themselves, but power against their opponents."
