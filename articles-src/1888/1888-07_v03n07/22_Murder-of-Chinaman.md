Charles Carey, who, at Chicago, on the 24th of May, pleaded guilty to the deliberate, wanton murder of a Chinaman, has been sentenced to fifty years' imprisonment. He ought to have gone to the gallows, and he would have gone to the gallows had it not been for the brutal influence of the political demagogues of both parties, who yell, "The Chinese must go," and palliate the crime of those who eject a Chinaman by taking his life. The defense of the self-confessed murderer, "I've only killed a Chinaman," reveals the horrid state of public opinion which demagogues have created at the heart of a so-called Christian civilization. Suppose a Chinaman in Canton or Amoy should stab an American missionary or merchant to the heart, and say that he "had only killed an American," what would the United States do and say about it?—*Oregonian.*
