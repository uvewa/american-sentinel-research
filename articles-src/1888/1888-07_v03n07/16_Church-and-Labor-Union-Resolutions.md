The Chicago *Advance* says that churches and labor organizations East and West are adopting the following resolution:—

> *"Resolved,* That we indorse the petition to Congress, asking it to stop Sunday work in its mail and military service, and in interstate commerce."

The *Advance* says that the latest indorsements to this resolution are those of "the Central Labor Union and the Carriers' Association of New York City, the Knights of Labor Council of Chicago and vicinity, the Presbyterian General Assembly, and the State Sunday-school Associations of Missouri and Kansas." "The Congregational ministers' meeting of Chicago has recommended that all Congregational Churches take action in this matter either by resolution or petition." What are the friends of freedom of conscience doing to offset this pressure that is being brought to bear upon Congress? If there are any such who don't know what to do, we will tell them: Give the American Sentinel a tenfold larger circulation.
