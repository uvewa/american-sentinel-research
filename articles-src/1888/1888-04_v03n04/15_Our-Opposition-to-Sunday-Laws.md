In the February Sentinel, it will be remembered that we asked Mr. W. T. McConnell "to show any commandment of God for keeping Sunday." We do not intend for a moment to convey the idea that we would not be opposed to civil laws enforcing its observance, even though it were commanded by the law of God. This was simply an *argumentum ad hominem.* We would be just as much opposed to civil laws enforcing the observance of Sunday, or any other day, even though it were commanded by the law of God, as we are as it is. Our opposition to Sunday laws is from *principle* and not from *partisanship.* The principle is that the civil power has no right to enforce the observance of any religious institution, of any kind whatever; nor to enforce any duty *as a commandment of God.* Yet, as against this principle, the Sunday institution is doubly weak: First it is wholly an ecclesiastical institution, and secondly, there is no commandment of God for it. And as the National Reformers propose to enforce the keeping of Sunday as a commandment of God, of course it is perfectly in order for us to call for the commandment, while at the same time we would oppose civil laws enforcing it, even though there were a commandment of God for it.
