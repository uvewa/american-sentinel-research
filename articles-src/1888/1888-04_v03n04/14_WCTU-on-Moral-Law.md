The Woman's Christian Temperance Union of Marion County, Missouri, in convention assembled at Palmyra, in that State, "resolved" that,—

> "We believe the very same condemnation and punishment should be visited upon man as upon woman for violation of the moral law."

So do we, and more than that, we know that it *will* be, for the Author of the moral law has said that "there is no respect of persons with God." What could have led these excellent Christian women to think that the same condemnation and punishment might *not* be visited upon man as upon woman for violation of the moral law, when the word of God is so plain on the subject? Do they suppose the Lord is going to prove recreant, and that it is therefore necessary for them to remind him of his duty? We suspect, however, that they have fallen into the dangerous error of believing that it is within the province of *civil* government to punish violation of the *moral* law, and they are contemplating the taking of God's work into their own hands.
