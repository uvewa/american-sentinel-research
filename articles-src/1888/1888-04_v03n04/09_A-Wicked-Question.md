# A Wicked Question.

A certain “W. J. C.” wrote to the *Interior *lately, from Gravel Hill, North Carolina, as follows:—

> “Dear Interior: I would like very much to have your views upon the legality of allowing heathen temples to be erected in this country, as I see they have such things in some places, and hear of no efforts being put forth to prevent them. Is our Constitution so flexible that it can be made to bend to suit every shade of invention of the devil? There is a vast difference between religious worship and idolatry. I do not think the Lord is well pleased with it, and are we not encouraging it by allowing it, and becoming therefore a party to the crime? Ought not the attention of the Government to be called to it, with a view to its suppression?”

And some people seem to think the spirit of the Inquisition is dead! Mr. “W. J. C.” ought to be told that however flexible our Constitution may be it cannot yet be bent to suit that worst of all the “inventions of the devil,”—religious persecution, and the despotism of religious bigotry which is so hard for “W. J. C.” and his kind even now to restrain. We are glad to see that the *Interior* has the right view of the matter. It answers the question thus:—

> “Undoubtedly every man in this country has a constitutional right to worship God, or any god, or no god, as he pleases; so long as he does so in an orderly way. Freedom of worship cannot be legally denied.”

It is not every religious paper in the land that sees the matter so clearly.

The reign of Constantine bears witness that the State which seeks to advance Christianity by the worldly means at its command, may be the occasion of more injury to this holy cause than the earthly power which opposes it with whatever virulence.—*Neander. *[33]
