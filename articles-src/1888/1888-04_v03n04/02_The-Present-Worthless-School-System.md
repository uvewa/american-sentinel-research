The New York *Independent* notes and comments as follows:—

> "'The present worthless school system,' is what the *Freeman's Journal* calls our scheme of public education. If the Roman Catholics insist on destroying this system, they will have to destroy the Nation to succeed."

Oh, no, they will not! All they will have to do to succeed is to wait a little while till the National Reform Association shall have gained the support and the influence of a few more Protestant leaders, and then to accept the persistently proffered alliance of the Association, and the work will be done; the system will then soon and easily be destroyed. But then, having succeeded, the Nation will soon be destroyed. The *Independent* is right as to results; it had only misplaced the items. They will not have to destroy the Nation to succeed in destroying our public-school system. But having succeeded in destroying our publicschool system, the destruction of the Nation will soon follow.
