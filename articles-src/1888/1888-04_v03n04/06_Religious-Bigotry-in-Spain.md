# Religious Bigotry in Spain.

The land of the Inquisition, of somber cathedrals and bloody bull-rings, is more intensely Roman Catholic than Italy, and owing to its comparative isolation is less influenced by modern ideas of progress. Under the reign of Queen Isabel II., Matamoras, Carasco, and their friends, converted Biblereaders at Malaga, were thrown into prison and condemned to the galleys for professing Protestantism and assembling for religious devotion; in consequence of a strong protest of an international deputation of the Evangelical Alliance, the sentence of penal servitude was changed into exile (1863). The misgovernment and immorality of the queen resulted in her expulsion from the throne (1868), and in a succession of civil wars.

The Constitution of 1869 declares, in Art. XXI, the Catholic Apostolic Roman Religion to be the religion of the State, and imposes upon the Nation the obligation of maintaining its worship and its ministers. This is old Spanish. The second clause grants, for the first time, toleration to non-Catholics in these words: “No person shall be molested in the territory of Spain for his religious’ opinions, nor for the exercise of his particular religious worship, saving the respect due to Christian morality.” Very good as far as it goes. But during the reaction under Alfonso XII., the Constitution was modified June 30, 1876, and the concession of toleration virtually nullified by the addition: “Nevertheless, no other ceremonies, nor manifestations in public will be permitted than those of the religion of State.” Thus the Constitution of 1876 restricts the liberty of non-Catholic worship to private houses. No church or chapel looking like a house of God, no tower, no bell, no procession, no public announcement is suffered by law, and Protestant preachers and evangelists depend altogether upon the tender mercies of the local magistrate, priests and people. Notwithstanding, the Protestants continue to labor, under these disadvantages, in about fifty humble places of worship in Madrid, Barcelona, Seville, San Sebastian and other cities where more liberality prevails than in ignorant and bigoted country districts. At the census of 1877 it was found that sixty per cent, of the population could not read.

On the other hand the Spanish Government has greatly diminished the material resources of the State Church. By two decrees of the Cortes, passed July 23, 1835, and March 9, 1836, all monastic establishments were suppressed, and their property confiscated for the benefit of the Nation.

Portugal knows and tolerates no other religion besides the Roman Catholic, except among foreign residents, who may worship privately in their houses, but not in a church. *—Dr. Philip Schaff, in Independent.*
