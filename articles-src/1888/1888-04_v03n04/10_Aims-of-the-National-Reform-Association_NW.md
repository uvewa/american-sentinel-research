"My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now is my kingdom not from hence." John 18:36.

The Jews expected the Messiah to establish a kingdom and enforce his teachings by laws and penalties of a worldly nature; and when they drew from him the confession that he was the Christ, and still disappointed their expectations, they brought him before Pilate with the charge of treason against the Roman Government. When Pilate asked him concerning it, he confessed, in the language of the text, and added, "To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth." Evidently, *this* truth. . Pilate was convinced that Christ's kingdom was of a nature that would not interfere with human governments, and said to the Jews, "I find no fault in him at all." He could not have said this, had he understood that his kingdom was of a worldly nature, secured and maintained by political strife and physical force.

When the soldiers went to take Jesus, Peter expected he would resort to force to deliver himself, and drew his sword to that end. But Jesus said, "Put up again thy sword into his place; for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? But how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be? " Matt. 26:52-54. He thus taught his disciples that turning to human power to advance his cause, was turning from him who said, "Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the Lord." Jer. 17:5.

Neither Christ nor his apostles ever appealed to such power or authority to propagate their doctrines, or ever sought redress from that source. Christ said to his disciples, "Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them. But it shall not be so among you; but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; and whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant." Matt. 20:25-27. There were to be no lords nor subordinates among them, but all were to be on equality under him.

True religion is voluntary. Enforced religion is a mockery. Paul says, "Though we walk *in* the flesh, we do not war *after* the flesh; for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds." 2 Cor. 10:3, 4. In Eph. 6:11, 12, he says, "Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil; for we wrestle not against *flesh and blood,"* hence no need of carnal weapons. The only weapon furnished in the Christian armory is "the sword of the Spirit," "the word of God." This is the only one used, or authorized to be used, by Christ and his apostles, in propagating or defending Christianity. The cause would doubtless have been far in advance of what it is to-day, if no appeal had ever been made to human force for its promotion, but had it been treated as entirely above worldly wisdom, power, or policy.

By what method and spirit do the National Reformers propose to accomplish their end? They shall speak for themselves. I give them credit for being conscientious. Saul of Tarsus was also conscientious in trying to propagate his faith by legal and forcible means, and overthrow what he thought opposed it. And, like him, the National Reform Association are evidently doing what is "c*ontrary to Jesus of Nazareth."*

Rev. M. A. Gault says, in the *Christian Statesman:—*

> "Our remedy for all these malefic influences is to have the Government simply set up the moral law, and recognize God's authority behind it, and *lay its hand on any religion that does not conform to it."*

Suppose the Pope of Rome should be the one to interpret what the moral law enjoins, would Mr. Gault be satisfied? But, of course, the National Reform Association expect to have that prerogative.—*Perhaps.*—Well, let us see what they intend to do. In their Article V, declaring reasons for amending the United States Constitution so as to make it a standard and guaranty of morality, Mr. Gault says:—

> "We need it to correct our most unfortunate attitude under the first amendment, which restrains Congress from prohibiting the free exercise [31] of any false religion, such as Mormonism, Oneidaism, pagan idolatry, etc."

This "etc." of course includes any religious beliefs and practices which *they* deem erroneous. The first amendment referred to reads thus: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." Freedom to worship God according to one's own judgment and conscience, they think, should not be tolerated, except as *their* judgment and conscience dictate to be proper. This change, they teach, is to be accomplished peaceably, *if all acquiesce, *and otherwise by force.

Mr. Gault says:—

> "Whether the Constitution will be set right on the question of the moral supremacy of God's law in the Government without a bloody revolution, will depend entirely upon the strength and resistance of the forces of antichrist."

What anarchist makes bloodier threats than this? It smacks strongly of the spirit of Roman Catholicism. "Cardinal Manning insists that it is a sin, and even an 'insanity' to hold that men have an inalienable right to liberty of conscience and of worship; or to deny that Rome has the right to repress, by force, all religious observances save her own, or to teach that Protestants in a Catholic country should be allowed the exercise of their religion."— *Grattan Guinness, in Christian Herald and Signs of our Times.*

Rev. W. J. Coleman at Lake Side, 0., last August said:—

> "There ought to be a mighty army ready to pour out treasure and blood, if need be, to vindicate the authority of Christ. The Bible should be adopted as a standard to decide questions of political life, to decide between right and wrong. The idea of a divine law and a divine Christ should be forced into politics. There is now no religion in the Constitution of the United States. Our aim is to bring this Nation to Christ, and to place it under the divine law. Our fundamental principles are, Christ is king of the Nation, and the Bible is the rule of action."

At the same convention Dr. McAllister said:

> "Those who oppose this work now will discover, when the religious amendment is made to the Constitution, that if they do not see fit to fall in with the majority, they must abide the consequences, or seek some more congenial clime."

The Roman Catholics will doubtless indorse this sentiment with the understanding that they shall be the ones to interpret, and the National Reform Association have already appealed to them to join with them in bringing this about. In an editorial of the *Christian Statesman,* December 11, 1884, is the following:—

> "Whenever they [Roman Catholics] are ready to co-operate in resisting the progress of political atheism, we will gladly join hands with them."

Yes, even to shedding the blood of their Protestant brethren, who conscientiously differ with them in such measures. Here is an appeal, virtually, to the Pope in Rome to aid them in changing the Constitution and government of the United States.

The following from the encyclical letter of Pope Leo XIII. (a. d. 1885) shows that the Roman Catholics are striving for the same power as are the National Reformers:—

> "We exhort all Catholics who would devote careful attention to public matters, to take an active part in all municipal affairs and elections, and to further the principles of the church in all public services, meetings, and gatherings. All Catholics must make themselves felt as active elements in daily political life in the countries where they live. They must penetrate wherever possible into the administration of civil affairs, must constantly exert the utmost vigilance and energy to prevent the usage of liberty from going beyond the limits fixed by God's law. All Catholics should do all in their power to cause the Constitutions of States and legislation to be moulded to the principles of the true church. All Catholic writers and journalists should never lose, for an instant, from view the above principles. All Catholics should redouble their submission to authority, and unite their whole heart and soul and mind in defense of the church and Christian wisdom."

Compare this with a speech of Rev. Jonathan Edwards, D. D., LL.D., Vice-president of the National Reform Association, in which he denounces Seventh-day Baptists as atheists. Speaking of atheists, deists and Jews, he said:—

> "The Seventh-day Baptists believe in God and Christianity, and are joined with other members of the class by the accident of differing with the mass of Christians upon the question of what particular day of the week should be observed as holy. These all are, for the occasion, so far as our amendment is concerned, one class. They use the same arguments and the same tactics against us. They must be treated, as for this question, as one party. Tolerate atheism, sir? There is nothing out of hell that I would not tolerate as soon."

What else does this mean, than that those who oppose this measure, however sincere and godly, are no more to be tolerated than the worst thing out of hell? Does this language breathe the love and charity exhibited and taught by Christ? *"If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his."* Rom. 8:9. "If they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry? " Luke 23:31. *—Rev. N. Wardner, D. D. *[32]
