More than once we have noticed, in the reports of the lecturers of the National Reformers, that they were opposed by Baptist ministers. This we should expect from our knowledge of Baptist principles. And sometimes they report that Baptist ministers heartily indorse their movement. This we should expect only where the Baptist ministers are regardless of the foundation principles of their faith; or where they have never inquired into the real object and intention of National Reform.

It is a truth that national religion, call it Church and State, or Religion and State, or what you will, cannot flourish where church membership is made to depend on conversion and personal piety. And no church can maintain the vitality and spirituality of religion, where national religion exists. The professed Reformers understand this to be so, however much they may plead for the necessity of national religion for the sake of upholding the church. Before they expect us to coincide with their movement, they ought to be able to point us to a single instance where national religion has preserved the spirituality of Christianity, and the purity of the church. The experiment has been made often enough, under very varied circumstances; but always with the same result. Religion has become a mere formality, whenever the State became its patron.

The following paragraph I copy from a National Reform paper. The editor gave his indorsement of the article in the strongest terms:—

> "Little ones are as much under the covenant as their fathers. They are an essential element in the Nation, and are to be taught, and by their presence to teach others, that the obligation to serve the Lord does not originate in personal engagement. Antipedobaptists are all opposed to national Christianity. They have sufficient perspicacity to see that from the claims of a national bond, children cannot be exempted; and the absurdity of excluding such as are under bond, from the church, because they are incapable of a personal consent to the ecclesiastical covenant, would be too glaring."

People with more consistency than the National Reformers possess, who fully believed the above sentiment, would never ask, or at least expect, Baptists of any class to join in their crusade for national religion, with its necessary accompaniment of national and unconverted church membership. It certainly takes a great deal of what is modernly called "cheek," for the self-styled Reformers to accuse the Baptists of being recreant to their principles in refusing to aid them in their efforts to establish national religion, with such an avowal as the above before the world.

We will notice a few points which present themselves in the above declaration.

1. These little ones who are born under the national system of religion, are members of the church. And such they must continue to be, without regard to the characters they form when they grow up, as long as they are citizens, or belong to the Nation. For, it would be absurd to exclude from the church those who are "under national bond," the "ecclesiastical covenant" being a national covenant. This leads naturally and unavoidably to an unconverted church membership. And this has been the result whenever national religion has been established.

2. This declaration shows the fallacy of the claim of the National Reformers, that their object is not to establish a national church, but national religion without a church. According to their own avowal, they who are under national bond, or under a national ecclesiastical covenant, are necessarily church members. They say that to suppose the contrary is absurd. But the fact that they are necessarily church-members does not necessarily make them Christians, or religious. In their system church membership comes before religion. They are church-members by virtue of the national covenant under which they are born, without any regard to "personal engagement." The national covenant may make them church-members, but it cannot make them Christians, or religious. It may deceive them, and settle them down in a false hope, by leading them to believe they are Christians by virtue of their church membership, which is by virtue of the national bond or covenant under which they were born. It may enable them to successfully practice hypocrisy for social or political reasons, but it never will have a tendency to arouse their religious convictions; or to lead them to trust in [27] "personal engagement" alone as the foundation of their religious hope, as it really is. All history attests that national religion has never had such a tendency, in a single instance. It has no such tendency to-day, even in this age of Bible privileges.

The system is radically wrong, and can be advocated only by those who have not studied its principles, or those who have a favorite church hobby to ride, and who are so self-complacent that they think they are doing God service by compelling uniformity to their particular belief.

That their object is Church and State, or a national established church, is clearly evident from their uniform teachings, notwithstanding their persistent denials. And we are compelled to believe that their denials are not made in perfect sincerity. We cannot give them credit for such a large degree of blindness or ignorance that they cannot understand the obvious intent of their oft-repeated declarations. Thus, in the same article from which we have quoted, bearing the strong indorsement of the editor, are found the following words:—

> It is the duty of civil rulers, in subordination to Christ, to recognize the church, its ordinances, and laws. It is not merely that the existence of such an organization is owned and tolerated, but a statutory arrangement, confessing the divine origin of the church, and the divine obligation resting on the nation to accept its doctrine and order, and engaging to regulate their administration in conformity with its constitution and object."

The avowed object is not that the State should acknowledge religion, and regulate its administration in harmony therewith, but it should, by statutory arrangement, confess the divine origin and organization of the church, and regulate its administration in conformity with the constitution and object, not merely of religion, but of the church. And this is not Church and State! oh, no. How we do wonder at the blindness of those who cannot see a plain distinction between Church and State and church and religion in such an arrangement as this! Alas for the church that is led by such leaders as the National Reformers; and alas for the nation when it is made subservient to such a church as they represent.

Ask anybody to point to the beginning of Church and State, and they will turn to Constantine the Great as the author of the system; the system which proved so disastrous to the purity of the church, and to the cause of vital Christianity. But our model Reformers do not want such a system as he established. No, they do not; for with such a system their ambition would never be satisfied. We will point out the difference between his system and that for which they ask.

Constantine established the church after the model of the empire, making the church and the empire as nearly identical as was possible, and retain the supremacy of the civil power. But the supremacy of the civil power was maintained during his reign, and for several centuries after his time. The church became the creature and servant of the empire; and the church rulers were willing to accord to the emperor the general supervision of the church, for the sake of the advantages which they derived, and the honor conferred upon the church, by the alliance. But our Reformers will not abide any such arrangement. They demand that the church shall be the controlling power, and the State exist to serve the interest of the church. The State must acknowledge the authority of the church, and the Government must be administered in conformity with the constitution of the church. Constantine made the church subservient to the State; but these modern Reformers intend to make the State altogether subservient to the church. And yet they have the effrontery to deny that they seek any arrangement that can be called a union of Church and State. We wonder that they deny their object, while their statements of the object are published in their periodicals, and circulated broadcast through the land. But our wonder is still greater that people give ready credence to their pretenses, and shut their eyes to those many avowals of their intention to have the State administered in subserviency to their church system.

Shall the sad history of the church repeat itself in the United States? In a future article we shall point out the change that came over the administration of the Government when the supremacy of the State was lost, and the church occupied the position that our Reformers want it to occupy in Protestant America. It really appears to us that nothing but personal ambition could lead men to be so blind as to the results of their efforts, as these seem to be.J. H. W.
