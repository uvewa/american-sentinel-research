# Mr. Gault Speaks.

In the Sentinel of December, 1887, in answer to the Christian Statesman’s inquiry, we wrote this:—

> “The Sentinel espouses the Christian theory of government; the theory enunciated by Christ, that men shall render to Cesar the things that are Cesar’s, and to God the things which are God’s; the theory that so far as man or civil government is concerned, the heathen, or the infidel, or the atheist, has just as much right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, as the Christian has.”

With this Mr. M. A. Gault makes his voice to clash after this sort:—

> “There are two difficulties about the Sentinel’s theory of government, one is its readers don’t understand it, and the other is it don’t understand itself. If it would only reason a moment it might discover that in our Government Cesar represents the people, and among the things we must render to Cesar is one day’s rest in seven, and the security of the family relation, the security of life, liberty and property.”

The great trouble with Mr. Gault is that he measures other people’s understanding by his own; and because he doesn’t understand a thing, he at once decides that nobody else [30] does. The gentleman greatly mistakes; the readers of the Sentinel do understand it, and the Sentinel thoroughly understands itself. As for Mr. Gault the Sentinel can only repeat to him the answer that Dr. Johnson once gave to one who said that he “didn’t understand: ” “I give you *reasons,* sir; I cannot give you an *understanding,* sir.”

Then he informs us that if we should reason a moment we might discover that “among the things we must render to Cesar is one day’s rest in seven.” Well, let us reason a moment. Christ commanded: “Render to Cesar the things which are Cesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s.” Now how did Cesar ever come into possession of one day’s rest in seven? The truth is he never came into possession of such a thing at all. The word of God says, “The seventh day is the Sabbath [rest] of the Lord thy God.” The Sabbath is God’s. He called it *“My* holy day.” It is *“the Lord’s* day.” And the Lord has never resigned to Cesar the possession of this day. Now as we are to render to Cesar only that which is Cesar’s, and as the Sabbath is wholly the Lord’s, therefore there never can be any obligation upon any soul to render to Cesar any such thing as the Sabbath or one day’s rest in seven. Cesar has no proprietorship whatever in the Sabbath, and he has no right to any. And whenever he attempts to assert any such thing, he obtrudes himself upon the rights and prerogatives of God; puts himself in the place of God; and demands the obedience which is due to God alone. And *that* is the principle of all Sabbath laws, and of Sunday laws, enforced by the civil power. And the Sentinel is going to tell the people so.
