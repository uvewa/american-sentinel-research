In his revival services in Kansas City, last January, "Sam" Jones said one day:—

> "One reason why I favor woman suffrage is because we would have more Christian voters if the women were allowed to vote."

True enough, but would we not have more un-Christian voters too? If not, why not? Not all of the women in the United States are Christians, by any means. The truth is, that there are a great many more women in the United States who are not Christians, than there are who are Christians. And although it is true that to give women the ballot, will give more Christian voters, it is equally true that there will be more unChristian voters also, and in the end the matter would not be helped at all. History does not present women-politicians in any better light then it does men-politicians.
