In a sermon at Kansas City, January 22, "Sam" Small, in speaking of our country said:—

> "From Maine and Massachusetts, to Georgia, all along the coast, the characters of the settlements gave it as one of their objects to glorify God, and forward his kingdom. . . . Then the heresy of hell took hold of a handful of people, and they made a Constitution, and left God entirely out of it."

We had thought to make some comments on this, but to brand as "the heresy of hell," the action of George Washington, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and the other noble makers of the United States Constitution, is sufficient of itself to render infamous the whole complaint which the speaker makes against the Constitution. Mr. Small is an evangelist and a great revivalist; now here is a conundrum: If the religion which he inculcates is compatible with such defamation as the above, then how much better off would this Nation be, if such religion should become National? We give it up.
