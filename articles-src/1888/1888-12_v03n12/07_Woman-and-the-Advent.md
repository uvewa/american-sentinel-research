# Woman and the Advent.

We used to think that the ballot in the hands of women would be the “handwriting on the wall” for the saloons of our land. But when we learned that there are in the city of Philadelphia alone 6,000 women *engaged in the liquor business,* that fact gave the prospect a somewhat different complexion. Whether or not there are in Philadelphia 6,000 well-bred, pure, and noble women who, if women could vote, would arm themselves with the ballot and go to the polls in behalf of law, sobriety, and home, may be something of a question; but if the privilege of suffrage was theirs, it is pretty certain that 6,000 ballots in that city would go from the hands of a certain class of women solid for rum. There are vicious women as well as vicious men; and the ballot in the hands of these would offset as many in the hands of the good and true.

But while the prospect in this direction appears less hopeful, evidence is more and more frequently appearing to show that women are as susceptible, at least as men, to fanaticism, and would be in danger of using the power of the ballot under the influence of prejudice and blind impulse, as often, perhaps, as under the guidance of intelligence and reason. That this is no uncharitable judgment, we offer as evidence the following paragraph from the “Prospectus of Evangelistic Board of the Nationel Woman’s Christian Temperance Union for 1888,” as published in the *Christian Statesman,* of April 26, 1888:—

> “As Christ came first by Mary alone in the stable at Bethlehem, so shall he *come the second time,* to reign King and Lord, by *this confederation of the women* of the whole world, exalted to the high place which is hers under the gospel; not only as the mother and educator of lawmakers and rulers, but set free from the domination of mere animal force, herself co-ruler and legislator in the State as well as in the home, according to God’s evident plan that the world should not always be left *comfortless.”*

In this quotation the italics are ours, with the exception of this last word, which we give as we find it. Allusion is evidently made to John 14:18, where Christ assures his sorrowing disciples, to comfort them in view of his departure to Heaven, that he will return again: “I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.”

Does the language of the extract quoted above mean that this “confederation of the women” is to *be* the second coming of Christ? that *through them* he is to reign King and Lord over the earth? Or does it mean that his second personal coming is dependent on this “confederation of the women”? With either view the position is unscriptural and fanatical enough to suit an Ignatius Loyola. It is easy to see how women who are ready to entertain such views, could be induced, under the subtle deceptions of the National Reform Association, to embark in favor of an oppressive Sunday law, which would ride rough-shod over the most sacred rights of conscience, and the dearest liberties of mankind. *—Review and Herald. *[88]

Note.—No papers are sent by the publishers of the American Sentinel to people who have not subscribed for it. If the Sentinel comes to one who has not subscribed for it, he may know that it is sent him by some riend, and that he will not be called upon by the publishers to pay for the same.

The *Christian Statesman* says:—

> “The American Sentinel is gradually defining its position, and American Christians will know exactly where to find it.”

Yes, we intend that “American Christians” and everybody else shall know exactly where to find the Sentinel.

National Reform petitions in favor of Senator Blair’s constitutional amendment, are being circulated for signatures. They will be presented to you before long, and when they are, you want to bear in mind that that amendment provides for the establishment of a National religion, and a consequent religious despotism.

The Executive Committee of the National Reform Association held a meeting in Pittsburgh September 14; and one of its recommendations is this:—

> “That Secretary Weir be appointed especially to press the cause of National Reform upon the attention of political parties, during the next four years, and to enlist, as far as possible, in this endeavor the influence of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union.”

In 1596, when James VI. of Scotland (I. of England), was attempting to force Episcopacy upon Scotland, a number of the Scottish clergy had an interview with the king, and when his Majesty accused them of holding seditious meetings (for so he characterized the meetings of the church for its own purposes), and of alarming the country without reason, one of them, Andrew Melville, thus answered him:—

> “Sir, as divers times before I have told you, so now again I must tell you, there are two kings and two kingdoms in Scotland: there is King James, the head of this commonwealth, and there is Christ Jesus, the king of the church, whose subject James the Sixth is, and of whose kingdom he is not a king, nor a lord, nor a head, but a member. . . . We will yield to you your place, and give you all due obedience; but again I say, You are not the head of the church; you cannot give us that eternal life which we seek for even in this world, and you cannot deprive us of it. Permit us then freely to meet in the name of Christ, and to attend to the interests of that church of which you are the chief member.”

Which was equivalent to saying that they recognized the king’s authority in civil matters, but that in matters of religion they acknowledged no sovereign but Christ. And that is just what the Lord himself taught when he said: “Render therefore unto Cesar the things that are Cesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s.” It is to be regretted that all men have not as clear views of the true relation of Church and State as were expressed by Andrew Melville to King James.

In the *Christian Statesman* of September 6, M. A. Gault says:—

> “I had a long talk with Hon. T. C. Richmond, leader of the Prohibition party in Wisconsin. He is a popular speaker and a logical reasoner. He is almost constantly in the field addressing large audiences, endeavoring to convince the people that the Prohibition party should drop every other issue but Prohibition.”

Mr. Richmond’s idea is correct. If Prohibition is what the Prohibitionists want, why are they not willing to work for that alone? If Prohibition is what they want, why are they not willing to secure the help of every element that can be enlisted in favor of Prohibition? The very fact that the so-called Prohibition party will not work for Prohibition alone, is proof that the religio-political managers of that party are only using the Prohibition issue as a stepping-stone to the establishment of their power, and the subordination of the civil to the ecclesiastical power.

A short time ago a preacher in Selma, Cal., delivered a sermon on Temperance, Prohibition, etc., in which he said:—

> “We have laws to punish the man who steals our property; but we have no law to prevent people from working on Sunday. It is right that the thief be punished; but I have more sympathy for that man than I have for him that works on that day.”

This is directly in the line of things promised by the Prohibition party. Whenever any party sets itself up as the protector of the Lord, and legislates upon things pertaining to God, then offenses, or supposed offenses, against God take precedence of all things else. Heresy becomes the highest crime. Then the thief will be let run, and receive sympathy, while the man who quietly works at his lawful and honest calling is prosecuted, fined, and imprisoned. And Senator Blair’s proposed amendment and Sunday law open the way for such men as this to carry their views into effect, by the civil power.

The *Tribune* of this city thinks that we are needlessly alarmed about the Blair Sunday Bill. The *Tribune* evidently does not understand the situation. The bill in question may fail to become a law, but that does not prove by any means that the serious consideration of such a measure is not a menace to religious liberty in this country.

The systematic and persistent efforts which are being made by hundreds of thousands of people banded together in various churches, associations, and societies throughout our land to secure religious legislation in this country, should arouse every liberty-loving citizen to a sense of danger, and set him to work to enlighten others in regard to National Reform designs and practices.

Senator Blair may be, as the *Tribune* intimates, a harmless “crank,” but there are many thousands afflicted with the same religious-legislation mania, and there is a dangerous method in their madness. We cannot afford to settle down in fancied security when such measures are being seriously proposed in the Senate of the United States.

The California *Christian Advocate* some weeks ago gravely informed its readers that “Congressman Plumb, of Kansas, has offered an amendment to the Sunday Civil Bill providing an appropriation for the building of a public drinking fountain in the Capitol.” Of course the bill to which the Kansas Congressman has offered an amendment is the Sundry Civil Appropriation Bill; but in these days of proposed Sunday legislation it is perhaps not strange that the friends of Sunday laws fail to discern what to them seems so small a difference. The time may come, however, when even the Sundry Appropriation Bill may contain clauses relative to Sunday, and then it will indeed be literally the “Sunday Civil Bill.”

Not long since a Prohibition Convention was held in Visalia, Cal. The preachers were very active and enthusiastic in it; and they succeeded in arousing a good deal of enthusiasm in the body of the convention. After the convention had dispersed the following question was put to two of the preachers: “I suppose the object of this is, in the long run, to work it into a Sunday law? ” And the answer was this:—

> “That is what it is; but we are not saying anything about that now, till we get the thing in running order—then we will bring that in.”

That is precisely the scheme which the preachers are working through the third-party-Prohibition movement, and that is just the way that they are working it. Under cover of Prohibition and temperance legislation they are working for the establishment of a religious depotism.

In a speech in Boston on “The Prospects of Catholicism in the United States,” Dr. Daniel Dorchester (Methodist) said:—

> “Some people have been very anxious lest the Pope should come to this country. But I say, Let him come; it is the best thing that could be done. And I really think I would attempt to raise money to buy 10,000 acres of the best land in the United States, and make him a present of it for the seat of his Government. But when he comes here, he will be a great deal less of a man than he is at Rome.”

No, he would not. If the Pope should come here, with the politicians, and the Protestant ecclesiastics ambitious of civil power, he would soon be the head of the Nation in all matters of advice and arbitration— he would virtually soon be the dictator. See the influence of Cardinal Gibbons. But if it is thus with only a Cardinal, what would it not be with the Pope? No, indeed; let not the Pope ever set foot in the United States. [89]
