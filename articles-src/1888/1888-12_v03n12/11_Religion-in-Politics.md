The following account we reprint from the Minneapolis *Tribune* of October 16, 1888. It not only shows how things are being worked in that city, but it shows that the effort of the churches to secure control of the civil power is as widespread as the churches themselves. This evil spirit seems to be in the very air, yet the mass of the people seem to be totally unconscious of it. Nor do the papers have a word to say against it, or to expose its subtle encroachments. Although the *Tribune* printed this as it is, not a word did it say in any way to call attention to the fact that it means nothing but the establishment of a religious despotism. When the churches can control legislation and "make" people attend churches, we should like to know how much further they would have to go before their actions would be parallel with those of the Papacy. The principle is now identical with that of the Papacy, and when they secure the power, their actions will be identical.

> "Last spring Dr. Strong, the secretary of the Evangelical Alliance of the United States, visited Minneapolis, and met with a committee of pastors who had been appointed to confer with him as to the advisability of organizing a branch of the Alliance here. Dr. Strong and the pastors held several conferences, but in view of the summer vacation being near at hand, definite action was deferred until fall. Meanwhile Rev. D. D. MacLauren, of the Church of Immanuel, was charged with much of the arrangement of the plans. Yesterday he reported partially at the ministers' meeting in the Young Men's Christian Association parlors. Next Monday, however, the matter will be the order of the day at this meeting, and will then take an active form.

> "One interesting feature of the proposed Alliance will be its *prominent participation in State and municipal politics and government. This means that it will watch closely all State and city legislation.* In its name and upon its recommendation bills will be introduced in the Legislature, and such legislation as will increase the penalties for violation of the Sunday laws of Minneapolis will be especially favored and pushed. For example, it is the opinion of the orthodox ministers of the city that the theaters should be closed on Sunday, and this, in particular, will be warmly fought by them. Not long ago they succeeded, by uniting, in killing Sunday baseball playing, and they are determined to do the same with Sunday theater going. At the bottom of the Evangelical Alliance is the spiritual object, which is expressed in the following words:—
> "'To manifest and strengthen Christian unity, to promote Christian fellowship and cooperation, to study social problems and to apply to their solution principles of the gospel, and especially to reach with Christian influence the entire community without interfering with the methods and polity of any of the denominations.'
> "To accomplish this object a comprehensive plan of organization has been proposed. Under the direction of the central Alliance, which will be governed by an executive committee and a paid secretary, ward Alliances will be organized as auxiliaries. These ward Alliances will embrace churches of the locality of all denominations, and under their direction a thorough house-to-house canvass will be made in order to ascertain the condition and needs of people, and *if possible to make them attend churches.* Charity will also be dispensed where it does not conflict with aid given by the regular charitable organizations of the city. After such a canvass has been made, it is proposed to appoint voluntary visitors. To each visitor ten families will be assigned, and he or she is to call on those families once a month regularly. For example, the system that will be pursued is similar to one now in operation in the Church of Immanuel. Visitors from that church go from house to house in the neighborhood, and report back on printed slips to the supervisor the number of families included, the number actually visited, the number who are members or not members of churches, how many Bibles have been supplied, the number of sick and needy, etc. The supervisor in turn reports to the Advisory Committee the aggregate of the visitor's reports. This will be the plan of the ward auxiliaries of the Evangelical Alliance, but with the complete obliteration of religious denominations. Catholics, Lutherans, and all are especially invited to unite in the work. No proselyting except for Christians is meant to be attempted.
> "In view of the fact that the opinion of the Catholic clergy on the subject is not definitely known, Father Henry McGolrick was seen last evening. He said:—
"'The Catholic clergy, I think, will gladly unite in this work as much as they possibly can. We have always labored quietly for the morality of the community, and we would be the last to be backward now. We are interested in making people better by every means in our power.'

> "Rev. D. D. MacLauren, who has had most of the preparation of the scheme of the Alliance to do, said last evening:—

> "'There is no organization yet in the city of Minneapolis through which Christianity as a unit can speak. The ministers of the city believe that Christian unity is strong enough now to make itself felt in ways that churches separately have little influence. The Evangelical Alliance movement is a great success in Oswego, N. Y., in Brooklyn, in Baltimore, and other cities. In Minneapolis all the clergy seem to be in favor of the plan proposed. The Scandinavians, I can assure you, will do their part well. In a Sunday or two it is expected that nearly all the ministers of the city will announce the plan of work of the Alliance in detail from their pulpits.'"
