The fundamental cord which binds and preserves American liberties is the common-school system. It is only by educating the masses of the people to a full understanding of the responsibilities of citizenship, that we can hope for a conservation of American ideas and a continuation of American liberty. By its unqualified opposition to the public-school system of the United States, the Catholic Church becomes an enemy of American liberty, and must be considered, not as a spiritual organization maintaining its right to religious supremacy, but as a secular foe attacking an educational system which is so closely allied to the progress and preservation of our republic as to be inseparable from the temporal interests of the community.

According to American principles, the Church and State are entirely divorced, each retaining unqualified control over matters spiritual and temporal, respectively. No religion can be recognized as exercising any political power, and all are alike free to worship, each according to its creed. This is the result of political evolution, and marks the birth of free thought and free speech. It is the paramount exponent of liberty, and as such must be maintained. . . .

The Roman Church in America has grown from a few mission schools in the last century to an enormous organization comprising over 7,000,000 followers, with vast properties situated in every State, county, and township of the Union. . . . But it must be remembered that this army of clergy and laymen are sworn to obey the temporal as well as the spiritual power of the Pope; they believe in Ultramontanism, and have stealthily obeyed the church's commands and worked for her interests until to-day the Roman Church controls an enormous amount of untaxable property, and is a power in the land, too little recognized by Americans.

The late campaign, in which the famed three R's played so important a part, is evidence that the Roman Catholic vote is a factor to be considered in politics. The press of the country know that if it would have the support of Catholics it must not criticise acts of the church, nor condemn its methods; the consequence is that no expostulation goes forth editorially against any act of aggression on the part of the church, and Romanists are truckled to like other factions. . . .

At different periods of our history opposition to Catholicism has assumed alarming proportions, as in the Know-nothing riots in the East, when churches were burnt and lives lost. Such outward violence is but unreasonable bigotry and impedes the advancement of American ideas. It is not by force but by the ballot and the equitable administration of the laws that the encroachments of the church must be met. To oppose any religion, for its doctrines, and to permit such opposition to assume violent proportions, is unjust and un-American; but to prevent the encroachments of the church upon the State by equitable means, is to defend American freedom. . .

The Roman Church (and in many instances the Lutheran) opposes the system of public education, because it maintains its exclusive right to religious instruction, and considers that it cannot confine itself to the task of merely imparting religious knowledge, but must have control of general education as a part of the spiritual prerogative. Republicanism demands that the people be educated at the public expense. The two conflict, and as the church cannot recognize the secular power of the Government, it will not relinquish its rights. From the beginning, this one question of educational control has called forth the continual animosity of the Church of Rome against republicanism, and how bitter this feeling is may be judged by a recent utterance of the *Freeman's Journal,* a Catholic organ, which says that "the common school system should go back where it came from— hell." No loyal American, whether Catholic or dissenter, can deny that such words savor of disgraceful bigotry and are aimed at a system which is co-existent with freedom. The late Cardinal Archbishop of New York, as quoted by M. Bouland, said that Catholics in this republic are as strongly devoted to the sustenance and maintenance of the temporal power of the holy Father as Catholics in any other part of the world; and if it should be necessary to prove it by acts, they are ready to do so. The *Catholic Review* states that "Protestantism of every form has not, and never can have, any right where Catholicity is triumphant." Any attempt to expostulate against the policy of a church is apt to be condemned as inconsistent with liberality, but the right of criticism is co-etaneous with the privilege of free speech, and no loyal American, whether Catholic or otherwise, can defend such words as consistent with American ideas.

*America* believes, as did Bluntschli, that "Christianity is not only the basis but the living element of our civilization; yet the legal foundation of the State does not by any means rest upon Christianity. The State has not grown out of the church, nor upon the church, but is completely independent of the latter and of her dogmas." No true American should oppose the Roman or any other church for its doctrines, so long as it remains strictly within the precincts of spiritual power; but when it attempts in the slightest degree to intermeddle in the affairs of State, or to oppose education and enlightenment, it becomes the enemy of liberty and civilization, and as such must be fought by every friend of freedom.—*America. *[96]
