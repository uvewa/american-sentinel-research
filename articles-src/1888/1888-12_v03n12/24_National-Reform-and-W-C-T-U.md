In his report to the *Christian Statesman* of November 15, Secretary Weir says:—

> "It was my privilege to speak, October 9, to the R. P. Presbytery of Pittsburg, on their invitation. The subject treated was the latest development of the National Reform movement, viz., in the line of practical politics, pressing its principles upon the various political parties for adoption."

> "October 11 the Pennsylvania W. C. T. U. gave opportunity to briefly speak on the same phase of the movement, and to ask their help. It was one of the experiences indeed to speak before a thousand Christian women. They unanimously adopted a resolution affirming National Reform principles as applicable to civil and political affairs, asking the women of their Unions to urge them on the various political parties.
> "To give effect to this, and to forward our principles in general, they created a new department—that of National Reform. This of course means a State superintendent for it, and county and local officers, just as in other departments. What opportunities will this give for mutual co-operation, distributing our literature, arranging for lectures or sermons, conventions, etc., as well as carrying the discussion of our principles just where it is so grievously needed, before the political parties."
Facts speak for themselves. It does not need a prophet to tell just what the W. C. T. U. of Pennsylvania, at least, is running into.
