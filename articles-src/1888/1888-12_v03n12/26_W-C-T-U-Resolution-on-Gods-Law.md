The *Christian Statesman* doubtless rejoices to be able to print the following:—

> "The Eighth District Woman's Christian Temperance Union Convention, at Augusta, Wis., October 2, 3, and 4, passed this resolution:—

> "Whereas, God would have all men honor the Son, even as they honor the Father; and,
Whereas, The civil law which Christ gave from Sinai is the only perfect law that will secure the rights of all classes; therefore,

> *"Resolved,* That civil government should recognize Christ as the moral Governor, and his law as the standard of legislation."

Comment seems almost unnecessary, and all we will say at this time is that the above is of the low view of the law of God that is held, and must of necessity be held, by National Reformers. The law given from Sinai was not a civil law. If it were a civil law, why would it require to be administered by a moral governor? If the law of God could be the standard in civil legislation, then it would cease to be the wonderful law that it is. But the thing which we wish to have remembered is the adoption of National Reform principles by the W. C. T. U.
