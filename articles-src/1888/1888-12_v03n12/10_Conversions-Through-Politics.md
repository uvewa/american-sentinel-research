In the time of the Woman's Temperance Crusade, through the prayers and Christian fortitude of these brave, devout women, there were reported scores of genuine conversions to Christ. We should like very much to see a report of the number of conversions effected through the *political* workings of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. [94]
