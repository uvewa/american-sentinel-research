The National Woman's Christian Temperance Union proposes to make Christ "this world's king; yea, verily this world's king in its realm of cause and effect; king of its courts, its camps, its commerce; king of its colleges and cloisters; king of its customs and its constitutions." But Christ himself declared, "My kingdom is not of this world." Therefore it follows that the kingdom which the Woman's Christian Temperance Union proposes to establish in this world is not the kingdom of Christ at all, but if established will be but a counterfeit of it, and that will be only a likeness of the Papacy. Christ says, "My kingdom is not of this world; " the Woman's Christian Temperance Union says, "Christ shall be this world's king; " therefore the word of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union is flatly against the word of Christ, and therefore *that part* of the work of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, is antichristian.
