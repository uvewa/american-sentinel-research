# Shall American Children Receive Their Educational Instruction from Rome?

The American people who are so quick to resent an insult to one of their fellow-citizens when abroad, seem slow to resent the insults and indignities heaped upon them by those same foreigners here in America.

It is well known by every citizen of this country that the Catholic Church has declared war against our public schools and proposed by every means within her power to wreck them, and to place her parochial schools upon their ruins.

The attack which was at first so secret and insidious is now made openly and boldly. The assumed humble mien has given place to open attack, and it behooves the American citizens to at once assert their rights or bend their knees and bow their heads and declare their recognition of but one law, one power, that of the Roman Catholic Pope

Where is the pride of the American people? Is it not enough that your politics are dietated [86] and controlled by the Pope at Rome? that you must permit your children to be educated by that church? Is it not enough to have flung at you, as Father Schaner, representing the Roman Catholic Church, flings,— “The public schools have produced nothing but a godless generation of thieves and blackguards,”—without their further taking their children from them and educating them in the belief that not alone were you raising generations of thieves and blackguards when alive, but that when dead you have gone to *hades, *never to be seen by them more?

Our dictionaries, our encyclopedias, our histories, give definitions of inquisitions and indulgencies, but all those dictionaries, encyclopedias, and histories must be laid aside for those made by Roman Catholics, and the process has already commenced in Boston, and the teacher who dares to give the generally-acknowledged definition of these two words, those given in dictionaries, the statements of encyclopedias, and the recitals of history, is removed.

And so it is that the glorious day that the Catholic *Telegram* talks about, when our publicschool system shall be shivered to pieces, is approaching.

You have heard a good deal of talk about the Travis case in Boston, where a teacher was removed from his school at the request of the Roman Catholics, for teaching the history as it was given to him; and yet this is not the only instance of Roman rule in Boston. A teacher there who had been marking some Roman Catholic children for coming late to school, was warned by the Catholic priest that he would make trouble for her if she continued to do that, which meant a dismissal, and she knew it and ceased.

The fact is the Catholics feel justified in insulting our public schools in any way they can; by every act they say, as the *Freeman’s Journal* says: “Let the public-school system go to where it came from—the devil.”

All this they mean, and more too; they have played their cards shrewdly; they have seen to it to get a sufficient number of Catholics on the school board, and in no instance where they had the power has a Protestant teacher been put in the public schools when a Catholic teacher could be obtained. And all this is allowed to be done for fear of losing the Irish vote; and so it is that, while they are but a small minority, they are actually ruling the majority.

We defy contradiction when we state that there is no country under the sun but what more freedom and tolerance is permitted than in this boasted land of freedom and liberty. You have more freedom of expression, and less danger in criticising the Roman Catholic Church, under the shadow of the Vatican in Rome than you have under the shadow of the old State House or Faneuil Hall in Boston. The teachers and scholars of the schools in Ireland are in less danger of insult and obloquy from the Irish people under English reign than the teachers and scholars here in America under alleged American reign. What a burlesque it is to talk about freedom and home rule for Ireland when our school-teachers dare not utter a word that may be construed as reflecting upon the Roman Catholic Church here in alleged free America!—*Peabody (Mass.)
