# Religion and Politics.

In the ancient world religion and politics were blended. Among the Jews religion ruled the State, which was a theocracy. Among the heathen the State ruled religion; the Roman emperor was the supreme pontiff *(pontifex maximus),* the gods were national, and the priests were servants of the State.

Christianity had at first no official connection with the State.

Christ directs us to render unto God the things that are God’s, and unto Cesar the things that are Cesar’s. Matt. 22:21. He paid the tribute money to the Jewish temple and obeyed the laws of Rome, but he refused to be a judge and divider of the inheritance of two brothers, as lying outside of the sphere of religion. Luke 12:14. He declared before Pilate that his kingdom is not of this world (John 18:36), and rebuked Peter for drawing the sword, even in defense of his Master. John 18:11. When the evil one tempted him with the possession of all the kingdoms of this world, he said unto him: “Get thee hence, Satan.” Matt. 4:10. Secular power has proved a Satanic gift to the church, and ecclesiastical power has proved an engine of tyranny in the hands of the State. The apostles used only the spiritual weapons of truth and love in spreading the gospel of salvation. They enjoined obedience to the civil power, even under Nero (Rom. 13:1, 7), but they would rather suffer imprisonment and death than obey even their own Jewish magistrate against the dictates of their conscience. Acts 4:29.

If men had always acted on this principle and example, history would have been spared the horrors of persecution and religious wars.

For three hundred years the Christian church kept aloof from politics, and, while obeying the civil laws and paying Tribute, maintained at the same time the higher law of conscience in refusing to comply with idolatrous customs, and in professing the faith in the face of death.—*Philip Schaff.*
