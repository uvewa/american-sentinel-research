# The Abiding Sabbath and the Lord's Day.

A review by Alonzo T. Jones, Oakland, Cal., Pacific Press Publishing House; 173 pp. ; price, 20 cents, post-paid.

This pamphlet is devoted to a critical review of two prize essays: One, "The Perpetual Obligation of the Lord's Day," by Rev. George Elliot, of West Union, Iowa, which was awarded a prize of $500 by the trustees of Dartmouth College, in 1883; the other, "The Lord's Day; Its Universal and Perpetual Obligation," by A. E. Waffle, M. A., formerly Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature in the University of Lewisburg, Pa., in 1884, which was awarded a prize of $1,000. To those who have a taste for theological controversy, this little work will prove interesting reading. Those not familiar with arguments adduced from Scripture and history in behalf of the seventh-day Sabbath will find many of them here concisely and pointedly set forth.— *True Educator. *[64]
