# The Church and State.

Whence has come about in modern history the great doctrine of the separation of the Church and State, for the purification of religion and the security of civil freedom?

This is the central question before us, and we are prepared to consider the relation of the church toward the realm of secularity as embodied in the institutions of the family, the school, the civil community, and the State. We must first inquire for the characteristic distinctions of the church and the State. The final object of the church is holiness, the assumption by man of the form of the Divine; the final object of the State is the production of justice, the form of freedom. The negative of justice is defined as crime; the negative of holiness is defined as sin.

Sin and crime furnish the two categories which these institutions, the church and the State, respectively deal with. Let us note the consequences of confounding them. If the State undertakes to preform the functions of the church, it will deal with crimes in their character of sin as well as in their character of injustice. If the church, on the other hand, usurps the functions of the State, it will attempt to carry sin over into the category of crime and punish it by temporal penalties. For the church or the State to attempt to perform one another’s functions is to destroy both functions. A crime or breach of justice is a deed of the individual which the State by its judicial acts returns on the individual. The State furnishes a measure for crime and punishes each criminal according to his deserts. The judicial mind is a measuring mind, a retributive mind, because trained in the forms of justice which sees to it that every man’s deed shall be returned to him to bless him or to curse him with pain. Now, a sin is a breach of the law of holiness, a lapse out of the likeness to the divine form, and as such it utterly refuses to be measured. It is infinite death to lapse out of the form of the Divine. A sin cannot be atoned for by any finite punishment, but only (as Revelation teaches) by a divine act of sacrifice. The church cannot decree a finite measure of penance for sin; therefore it can only pronounce eternal doom on the sinner unless he repents. Religion says that the sinner must repent and return to holiness, and then his sin has been forgiven. The church meets sincere repentance with unreserved forgiveness.

It would destroy the State to attempt to treat crimes as sins and to forgive them in case of repentance. It would impose on the judiciary the business of going behind the overt act to the disposition or frame of mind within the depths of personality. But so long as the deed is not uttered in the act, it does not belong to society, but only to the individual and to God. No human institution can go behind the overt act and attempt to deal absolutely with the substance of man’s spiritual freedom.

If the church attempts to administer civil functions, it falls into the habit of weighing sin in finite scales, and by and by it comes to indulging mortal sin for the sake of mere secular penances and even for money paid in advance. If a noble ecclesiastic attempts to reform the civil magistracy under a theocracy, he is apt to fall into the use of the severe code of Draco, who punished all crimes with death, or else, in the careful weighing of the deed in order to award just penalties, the church official comes to lose his sense of the enormity of sin.

Sin and crime must not be confounded, nor must the same deed be treated as crime and sin by the same authority. Look at it as crime, and it is capable of measured retribution. The law does not pursue the murderer beyond the gallows. He has expiated his crime with his life. But the slightest sin, even if it is no crime at all, as for example the anger of a man against his brother, an anger which does not utter itself in the form of violent deeds, but is pent up in the heart—such non-criminal sin will banish the soul forever from Heaven, unless it is made naught by sincere repentance.

The divine and secular must be separately organized as institutions; but this does not imply that they may be organized in antagonism. It is of the nature of Christianity to encourage independence of church control on the part of all other institutions when they are once in harmony with its divine ideal. For it is the principle of Christianity in its innermost essence to teach the nature of God as one of infinite grace—a God who sacrifices himself in order that imperfection may have the opportunity to put on the divine form of holiness and enjoy independent personality forever, always growing from more to more in intellect and will. The form of holiness is simply the form in which the individual may grow in personality without ever contradicting and annulling his true being.

What we here see in these general terms to be the relation of the church to the State is also the relation of the church to the secular, specifically, in all details.— *W. T. Harris, *[16]

A man is not always known by the company he keeps. He may have bad fellowship in a good cause. Nevertheless it is a fact worth a thought or two on the part of those Protestants who insist upon introducing religious teaching in the public schools,—that the Roman hierarchy are with them in emphasizing this demand, from the humblest priest to the Pope in the Vatican.—*Christian at Work,*

About two months ago we made the statement and proved it that the National Reform Association is running in its list of Vice-Presidents the names of men who are dead and who have been dead for years. Since writing that we have received additional evidence in proof of this statement. We have these proofs in writing and signed by disinterested and authoritative persons. But, anything at all to win, is the principle upon which these National “Reformers” work.

It is with pain that the *Congregationalist* notices an increasing tendency to disregard the sanctity of Sunday. It cites “for example” an account of “a great train load of the Grand Army which drew out of one of the Chicago stations on a Sunday morning, on its way to St Louis;” and then says:—

> “Doubtless there was a considerable sprinkling of church members among these Sunday travelers, whose consciences were not quite at ease over what they were doing.”

Yes, “doubtless” that is so. Therefore, by all means, let the civil authority of the Nation come to the rescue, and entirely ease the consciences of these Sunday Christians by the enforcement of a rigid, uncompromising Sunday law, that shall compel these church members to do, as church members, what they have not conscience enough to do otherwise. Only let the civil law supply the place of conscience in all these people, then they will all serve the Lord.

Let it be understood that it is not the man who talks the most about honoring Christ, who really does honor him. Said Jesus, to some who were profuse in their professions, “Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?” A humble life of selfdenial, patterned after the divine model, and filled, like his, with good deeds, is the only way that Christ can be honored. When Christ was on earth, he resisted every attempt to bestow upon him political honors; and he is “the same yesterday, and to-day, and forever.” Those who loudly proclaim their loyalty to Christ, and long for power to cut off those who do not acknowledge him, are in the same condition that Peter was on the night when he cut off the ear of the high priest’s servant, or of the two disciples who wished to call down fire from Heaven upon the Samaritans. Our desire for them is that, like those disciples, thay may see the manner of spirit that they are of, and may become true followers of Jesus.

Speaking of that political preachers’ committee that was lately appointed in New York, the *Christian Nation* says that “Archbishop Corrigan will be invited to serve on it.” We can inform the *Christian Nation* now and even at this distance that Archbishop Corrigan will not “serve” on the committee. Catholic Archbishops don’t serve Protestants in any capacity whatever. In fact they don’t serve anything or anybody but the Cardinals and the Pope. They may get Archbishop Corrigan to *rule* on the committee, but it is a settled thing that he will never *serve* there. There is another reason for this too. No Catholic Archbishop in Christendom would ever consent to receive, from Protestant preachers, instruction or guidance in political workings; and this for the simple reason that there is not one of them who does not know more on that subject than all the Protestant preachers together ever knew. There is not a Catholic priest in New York City who could not at a moment’s notice give those preachers more “pointers” in their political scheme than they ever dreamed of. The Archbishop may consent to help them along, but it is certain that he will never do it in the form of a servant.
