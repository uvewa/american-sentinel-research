Whence has come about in modern history the great doctrine of the separation of the Church and State, for the purification of religion and the security of civil freedom?

This is the central question before us, and we are prepared to consider the relation of the church toward the realm of secularity as embodied in the institutions of the family, the school, the civil community, and the State. We must first inquire for the characteristic distinctions of the church and the State. The final object of the church is holiness, the assumption by man of the form of the Divine; the final object of the State is the production of justice, the form of freedom. The negative of justice is defined as crime; the negative of holiness is defined as sin.

Sin and crime furnish the two categories which these institutions, the church and the State, respectively deal with. Let us note the consequences of confounding them. If the State undertakes to preform the functions of the church, it will deal with crimes in their character of sin as well as in their character of injustice. If the church, on the other hand, usurps the functions of the State, it will attempt to carry sin over into the category of crime and punish it by temporal penalties. For the church or the State to attempt to perform one another's functions is to destroy both functions. A crime or breach of justice is a deed of the individual which the State by its judicial acts returns on the individual. The State furnishes a measure for crime and punishes each criminal according to his deserts. The judicial mind is a measuring mind, a retributive mind, because trained in the forms of justice which sees to it that every man's deed shall be returned to him to bless him or to curse him with pain. Now, a sin is a breach of the law of holiness, a lapse out of the likeness to the divine form, and as such it utterly refuses to be measured. It is infinite death to lapse out of the form of the Divine. A sin cannot be atoned for by any finite punishment, but only (as Revelation teaches) by a divine act of sacrifice. The church cannot decree a finite measure of penance for sin; therefore it can only pronounce eternal doom on the sinner unless he repents. Religion says that the sinner must repent and return to holiness, and then his sin has been forgiven. The church meets sincere repentance with unreserved forgiveness.

It would destroy the State to attempt to treat crimes as sins and to forgive them in case of repentance. It would impose on the judiciary the business of going behind the overt act to the disposition or frame of mind within the depths of personality. But so long as the deed is not uttered in the act, it does not belong to society, but only to the individual and to God. No human institution can go behind the overt act and attempt to deal absolutely with the substance of man's spiritual freedom.

If the church attempts to administer civil functions, it falls into the habit of weighing sin in finite scales, and by and by it comes to indulging mortal sin for the sake of mere secular penances and even for money paid in advance. If a noble ecclesiastic attempts to reform the civil magistracy under a theocracy, he is apt to fall into the use of the severe code of Draco, who punished all crimes with death, or else, in the careful weighing of the deed in order to award just penalties, the church official comes to lose his sense of the enormity of sin.

Sin and crime must not be confounded, nor must the same deed be treated as crime and sin by the same authority. Look at it as crime, and it is capable of measured retribution. The law does not pursue the murderer beyond the gallows. He has expiated his crime with his life. But the slightest sin, even if it is no crime at all, as for example the anger of a man against his brother, an anger which does not utter itself in the form of violent deeds, but is pent up in the heart—such non-criminal sin will banish the soul forever from Heaven, unless it is made naught by sincere repentance.

The divine and secular must be separately organized as institutions; but this does not imply that they may be organized in antagonism. It is of the nature of Christianity to encourage independence of church control on the part of all other institutions when they are once in harmony with its divine ideal. For it is the principle of Christianity in its innermost essence to teach the nature of God as one of infinite grace—a God who sacrifices himself in order that imperfection may have the opportunity to put on the divine form of holiness and enjoy independent personality forever, always growing from more to more in intellect and will. The form of holiness is simply the form in which the individual may grow in personality without ever contradicting and annulling his true being.

What we here see in these general terms to be the relation of the church to the State is also the relation of the church to the secular, specifically, in all details.— *W. T. Harris, *[16]
