Liberty of conscience means non-interference by the State with private convictions. It means that so far as the State is concerned the individual has the right to his own private judgment in religious affairs. It means that neither shall preference be shown, nor punishment inflicted, by State authority, because of individual religious belief. It does not mean classification and preservation of the wards of the State for purposes of indoctrination by the Roman Catholic or any other church.

Religious worship is not a civil ordinance, any more than religious profession is a civil qualification. The obvious intent of the language of the Constitution is that the State shall be impartial, colorless, and unconscious in all that relates to individual religious opinions.

The moment the State, by legislative act, takes official cognizance of the distinctive claims of any sect,—the moment it admits, no matter how indirectly, as a civil incident, the fact of religious differences of opinion, that moment the spirit of our fundamental law is violated, and we cannot escape the danger of sectarian discrimination, preference, and consequent injustice, with the certainty that such distinction will also be applied to our public schools.

Any classification whatever on religious grounds, by State authority, will inevitably lead to bitter and acrimonious sectarian controversies, to social disorder, and would seriously imperil the peace of the community. *—Selected.*
