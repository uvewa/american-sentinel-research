A recent Monday issue of the New York *Herald* contained the following report:—

The Rev. Dr. Armitage, pastor of the Fifth Avenue Baptist Church, preached to a large congregation yesterday morning upon "Divine Dealings with our Country." He reviewed the formation of the Constitution and congratulated his hearers that the members of the convention had been divinely led to omit from the Constitution any reference to God, and instead to make one of its clauses read, "No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States." But even this language, explicit as it is, did not seem to the Baptists of Virginia in 1788 a sufficient guarantee of religious liberty. They feared that, in spite of it, a State religion might be established by Congress, and they wrote to Washington complaining that the convention had not taken a more decided stand. Washington replied that he deeply regretted that the Baptists, whose courageous patriotism had been shown in many a battle during the Revolution, should have grounds for any such fears, and that he would recommend that Congress should consider the matter. This led to the first amendment to the Constitution: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free use thereof," which settled the question of religious liberty in this country for all time to come.

It was ridiculous for anyone to say that the fathers of the Constitution had any idea of establishing an atheistic nation. Almost all of them were professing Christians, but they felt that their business was to construct a civil government—a republic, not a theocracy. To have introduced the name of God into the Constitution as the head of the Nation and then to have left his relations and his honors undefined, nor provisions made for his worship and his support on the part of the Nation, would have introduced a subject of perpetual contention into the body politic, because it would have stood as an anomaly in the great instrument. The logical sequence must have been the establishment of a State religion of some sort as a legacy of perpetual strife.
