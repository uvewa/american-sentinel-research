Speaking of that political preachers' committee that was lately appointed in New York, the *Christian Nation* says that "Archbishop Corrigan will be invited to serve on it." We can inform the *Christian Nation* now and even at this distance that Archbishop Corrigan will not "serve" on the committee. Catholic Archbishops don't serve Protestants in any capacity whatever. In fact they don't serve anything or anybody but the Cardinals and the Pope. They may get Archbishop Corrigan to *rule* on the committee, but it is a settled thing that he will never *serve* there. There is another reason for this too. No Catholic Archbishop in Christendom would ever consent to receive, from Protestant preachers, instruction or guidance in political workings; and this for the simple reason that there is not one of them who does not know more on that subject than all the Protestant preachers together ever knew. There is not a Catholic priest in New York City who could not at a moment's notice give those preachers more "pointers" in their political scheme than they ever dreamed of. The Archbishop may consent to help them along, but it is certain that he will never do it in the form of a servant.
