# Religious Instruction in the Public Schools.

In a recent paper read before the St. Louis Pedagogical Society, the president of the Illinois State Normal School took the position that not morality only, but religion as well— not sectarianism—should be daily taught in the public schools. And we are told “by far the greater number present assented to the principles enumerated by the speaker.” No doubt underlying this view is a strong feeling of the necessity of religious instruction; we have schools where the three R’s and the more advanced secular studies are pursued; why should not religion, which above everything else must concern man’s present and future happiness, be also inculcated? Touching this matter we have a few words to say.

In the first place it should be brought to mind that teachers are not selected with reference to their qualifications as religious instructors. Many of our teachers, especially many women teachers, are admirably qualified for such work, which they so efficiently carry on in Sunday-schools. On the other hand, many teachers, we regret to know, are agnostics pure and simple. They claim not to know if there be any immortality; least of all do they consent to any need of salvation through Jesus Christ. Then in many places —not only in the city—the teachers in our schools are Roman Catholics. They do not teach religion now, for they are not allowed to. But were they to do this, what sort of religion would they teach? Obviously there is but one religion that the Romanist can teach, or would be allowed by his church to teach, and that is Roman Catholic sectarianism. Between this and Protestantism and Judaism no compromise seems possible; so that if religion is to be taught, we must have distinctively Protestant schools, Roman Catholic schools, Jewish schools—and why not Unitarian schools? Where shall we stop?

Again, we need to recall the fact that religion is not a catechism—a thing of question and answer. It is a matter of life and of love; it must be preached by example, and the religious teacher must get at the heart of his pupils, as is often, not always, the case in the Sunday-school, where the relationship of teacher and pupil is one of affection, with no particle of compulsion. Teach the Bible as you teach arithmetic, and the result would rather be hatred than love of the Bible. The proposition made by the Normal School principal noted above to teach “not sectarianism, but a sense of responsibility to God,”—this is ethics of a somewhat uncertain kind; but an eviscerated, unsectarian doctrine, with no personal love to the Saviour awakened, would be a very poor substitute for a throbbing, personal religion; it would rest the young soul in a dead formalism, and would leave the last state of that soul worse than the first. One of our correspondents sees no objection to reading a part of the Scriptures in the school. But this is far from carrying religious instruction with it. The Bible is read in our city schools, but the whole New Testament is expurgated out of deference to our Jewish friends; how much religion is secured to the children in this way? A little inquiry made of the teachers in our schools would elicit the answer which we have heard them repeatedly make,—none at all.

But there is another and even more dangerous point to be pressed home, and it is this. This matter of religious instruction in the public schools is the one which is most strongly emphasized by the Roman Catholics. Why? Simply because they are determined, if they can, to make the State supply Roman Catholic instruction to the thousands of nondescript waifs and poor children of Catholic Churches, and so save to the church the expense of the religious instruction of their children. There is not a Roman Catholic prelate in the country who will have anything else than distinctively Roman Catholic doctrine declared to the children of Roman Catholics; and this instruction must be inculcated by a priest—this is the Roman Catholic position all through.

Disestablish the non-sectarian school, and it is not difficult to forecast the result: we shall have Trinitarian and Unitarian, Protestant and Jewish teachers inculcating their respective doctrines, just as the three R’s are now taught. Small will be the gain in that quarter, but great will be the loss where the loss has already fallen most heavily—in the domain of home instruction. But our Roman Catholic friends will do their work differently. They will secure as teachers priests of their own sect, to be paid by the State, and so the State will be devoting its public moneys to the support of a large part of the Roman Catholic clergy, and to the instruction of coming generations in Roman Catholic sectarianism with no cost to the Roman Church. Indeed, the Roman Catholics in this State are already moving in this direction. Last winter they caused a bill to be introduced in the Senate of this State, the object being to facilitate the commitment of idle, truant, vicious, or homeless children to the Roman Catholic Protectorate, and to enable the schools of this Roman Catholic institution to “participate in the distribution [12] of the Common School Fund.” It is understood the same bill is to be introduced this coming winter.

Now for ourselves we do not want to see anything of the kind; and it does seem strange that Protestants, whose good intentions and conscientiousness of conviction cannot be questioned, do not see the danger that lies in the direction of converting our schools into theological seminaries—we use the term advisedly, for there can be no religion taught without theology, although a great deal of theology may be inculcated carrying with it not one particle of soul-saving religion.

Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter:—

1. *Stand by our schools as they are.* Any different course is fraught with danger to the State and the cause of religion. We want no open door through which theological animosities and burning controversies over pedagogical fitness to instruct religiously, can enter; there are enough of these disturbing the church councils, conventions, and missionary societies to-day!

2. *Develop religion in the home.* We need to get back to first principles and first practices, when the Scriptures were committed by the young, and read by all. We need to return to the earlier days of the republic, when religion was imbibed with the mother’s milk, and when the “Cotter’s Saturday Night” was not less a beautiful poem than a living fact, transplanted to the earlier homes of the American colonies. To this work the church should and must address itself. And when this result is reached we shall hear no more pleas made for theological instruction in the schools, for the religious truth will have been received through the religious life, as exemplified and inculcated and imparted in the hallowed, enduring precincts of the home.—*Christian at Work.*
