What has a purely religious institution to do with the claims of a political? This country in its government knows no creed. As a people we disclaim religious tests. The observance of the Sabbath and the mode of that observance are matters of the individual conscience. This is the measure of our religious freedom, that we may believe or otherwise,—we may observe or otherwise,— just as seems to us good. Under what pretext, then, does a political party interfere with religious beliefs and observances? The fullest personal freedom is the proper condition for the existence of genuine religion.— *Washington Post.*
