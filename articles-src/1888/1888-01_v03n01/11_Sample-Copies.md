# Sample Copies.

We send this number of the American Sentinel to many who are not subscribers. Please read the paper carefully, and then send us your subscription for 1888. We are certain that you will find it worthy of your patronage.

If you will send us two *new* subscribers at 50 cents each, we will send *you* the Sentinel one year *free.*

The duty of the State is to protect its citizens, to preserve order, and to *dispense justice. *The duty of the church is to teach religion and to *dispense charity.* Charity, divorced from religion, provided for by public taxation, and dispensed by the State, loses its essential quality. It then becomes a certain and secure provision which society makes for its unfortunate and pauper classes.—*Selected. *[9]
