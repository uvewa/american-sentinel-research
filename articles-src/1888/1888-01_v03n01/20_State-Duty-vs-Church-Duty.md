The duty of the State is to protect its citizens, to preserve order, and to *dispense justice. *The duty of the church is to teach religion and to *dispense charity.* Charity, divorced from religion, provided for by public taxation, and dispensed by the State, loses its essential quality. It then becomes a certain and secure provision which society makes for its unfortunate and pauper classes.—*Selected. *
