# Religious Despotism in Russia.

Not long since an American citizen was imprisoned in Russia for preaching the gospel, and it is probable that only the timely and energetic efforts of the worthy American Minister at St. Petersburg saved him from being sent to Siberia. This circumstance caused much comment in the United States, and Russia was severely criticised for her religious intolerance. It is likely that the readers of the heading of this article will expect that I shall strongly condemn Russia for her religious despotism. But that is far from my purpose. I write to explain her position, and to show that she is not so far behind the spirit of this enlightened age as many suppose.

There is a homely saying that one-half the world does not know how the other half lives. The United States has a vast domain, a fastincreasing population, and her resources are immense. Yet if some of her citizens could be suddenly transported from the scenes of a Fourth-of-July celebration and be set down amid the almost countless cities of the Old World, with their ever-busy swarming millions of inhabitants, it would seem as if the glory of their own land had suddenly collapsed, and that there was another side to this busy world. Here, America is not seen, and her greatness is not appreciated. There, she alone is seen, and the greatness of the Old World is quite as little appreciated.

But the American people have less idea of the real condition of spiritual things in Europe, than of the temporal. An American traveler was speaking of the sameness of the world and the church on the Continent, when a continental friend replied: “The world is the church here. We are born church members. In our infancy we are baptized according to the ordinance of the church; in later years this action is confirmed. This is emphatically a Christian country.”

In Russia the Czar is as truly the head of the church as he is the ruler of the nation. His civil and spiritual rule and authority exactly correspond; one is just as extensive as the other. To this he allows exceptions in favor of certain religions under certain circumstances. In this is manifested his religious tolerance and forbearance. A foreign or dissenting preacher may obtain permission to preach there if he has a congregation to which he can preach. And he may proselyte from other dissenting bodies, but he must not proselyte among the members of the State church. This, it is true, confines his labors to a narrow field; but this is considered a minister’s duty there. Proselyting is scarcely known and never countenanced. And the Government pursues the only course that it consistently can. To ask more than this of the Czar is to ask him to undermine his own authority.

The nation is the church. The Czar is the head of both at once—or, rather, both in one. Therefore to become a dissenter—to unite with another church—is to renounce allegiance to the Czar. If there is any difference in the strength of the ties of loyalty, preference is always supposed to be on the side of the spiritual. It is so with Catholicism. To the charge that Catholics in England and America are subjects of a foreign prince, or ruler, a Catholic writer replied: “Nowhere in the world is the Pope a foreign prince to a true Catholic.” Everywhere, in every nation, the first and highest allegiance of the Catholic is to the Pope. He maintains a citizenship in other States, only subordinate to his allegiance to the Pope, and subservient to the interests of his church. This is true of every truly loyal and consistent Catholic.

From this it is readily seen that it is impossible to renounce allegiance to the Czar in the church, and yet maintain allegiance to him in the civil government. They are inseparable; to unite with another church is treason against the Czar. And no method of argument can show that it is any less than, or anything else but, treason.

This is the true logic of National Religion. On this basis, the course of the Czar is consistent. To permit foreign preachers to enter his empire and turn away his subjects from him as their spiritual head, is to tolerate treason; and every such preacher is an inciter to treason. He is not there a dissenting minister of the gospel; he is a disturber of the peace and a destroyer of the security of the empire. He is a dangerous person.

And this reasoning holds good in every place where there is State religion. And a State religion, a coerced religion, depends for its strength and perpetuity on the strength and amount of authority put forth for its maintenance. In Prussia the religion of the empire is Lutheranism. But the Government is liberal, and the result is that to-day the Catholics have virtual control of the nation. They control the courts. It has been lately decided, in a case prosecuted by the Attorney-General, that it is a public outrage to speak contemptuously of the institutions of the Catholic Church. And this while the Catholics continually heap reproach upon the name of Luther and the Reformation, without rebuke. [2] And in England the state of things is no better. Under a liberal system, Ritualism, or Catholicism, as it is in fact, increases in the church, undermining it in every quarter, and open infidelity is taught by ministers of the established church.

When this triumph of the Papacy in Prussia became a matter of public notoriety, the papers of the State church called upon the Government for a more liberal outlay of money, and more generous and vigorous efforts to build up the church in the realm, without which it must suffer from the aggressions of the Papal power. But a dissenting paper very aptly said that right there was the foundation of the whole difficulty. They have delegated the work of the church to the State, and instead of doing evangelistic work, they have depended on the money and fostering care of the State, until the church has lost its vital power, and the people are left open to the assaults of the Papacy, which knows so well how to make itself popular with those who have been brought up to a belief in a National Religion.

It has yet to be seen whether it is possible to retain vitality and a spirit of evangelizing in a church which is allied to the State, and depends on its patronage and support. Such a thing has never yet been known. Certainly the present condition of things in the nations of Europe is not flattering to the hopes of those who expect good to come out of such a coalition.

The advocates of National Religion may reply that this is the result of too much leniency; that the only safe and consistent course is to prevent contrary religions from spreading and gathering strength in the land. *In this reply we find a vindication of the course of the Czar of Russia.* All National Religionists in America, who plead the necessity of suppressing dissenting religions by State authority, take sides with the Czar of Russia. The logic of his actions is the logic of their arguments. And the increasing influence of the National Reform Association—the increasing demand for a legal religion in America—proves what I said in the beginning, that the Czar in suppressing the preaching of a free gospel in Russia, is not as far behind the spirit of the age as many suppose.

No dissenter can be a good citizen of Russia; no dissenter will be considered a* “bona fide* citizen” of the United States, if National Religion ever becomes an established fact. They who plead for it are not blind to the results—they plainly declare that all who will not consent to the established religion will be disfranchised.

Another logical result of such a procedure is also shown. It is evident that a dissenter in Russia is held to be a despiser of civil authority. Even so, if National Religion ever obtains in the United States, a neglect to observe the usages of the established religion will not be held an offense against religion; it will be an offense against the State. Punishment for failure to observe the institutions of Christianity, or what they may call such institutions, will not be religious persecution, it will be punishment for disregarding civil authority—for violating the laws of the State. True, the laws of the church, or of religion, and the laws of the State will be identical; the laws of religion will become the laws of the State. But violation of those laws will not be punished as violations of religious laws, but as State laws! “Here is wisdom.” Dissenters will not be church culprits; they will be rebels and traitors. The old story will be repeated; heresy will be the highest crime —but always against the State.

And why not? Spiritual laws are the highest; church relations are the most important. Religious laws, on becoming State laws, are doubly important. The violator of such laws is a greater criminal than the violator of a merely civil law, and his punishment should be greater. But it must always be borne in mind that he is punished for their violation *only as State laws.* Religion is not a factor in the article of punishment.

Such was the logic of Romanism. And already this logic is adopted in America by statesmen and religious papers of high and commanding influence. When men are punished for dissenting from religious tenets, which are in contradiction of their own faith, they are not then to be considered religious tenets—they suddenly become “police regulations.”

Let the American people calmly regard this picture, in the light of history, of the action of Russia, and of passing events in the United States. National Reformers may still deny that their movement tends to a union of Church and State. Their denial is no better than a studied deception. Let them call it what they will; the fact remains that in its results it is exactly in harmony with the present action of Russia in shutting out a free gospel from her dominions. And what further witness can anyone ask than their indorsement of the Roman Catholic Church as the advocate and exponent of National Religion? Deny as much as they will, dissemble as they may, just such a National Religion as the Catholic Church upheld in the days of her power, and which she still advocates, is just the form of National Religion for which they plead. Are the American people ready to accept their plea? Are they willing to have religion established on such a basis?

To every lover of American liberty, of the sacred privileges granted under her benign Constitution, the American Sentinel must be an acceptable messenger of good-will. May it ever prove a faithful sentinel, and may its faithful warnings be heeded by every lover of his country. J. H. W.

As American citizens, we hold to the American doctrine that human government relates solely to external affairs, and does not reach, and is not intended to control, our spiritual relations. Civil government covers the relations of citizens to each other, and to the State. Divine government concerns our relations, both individually and collectively, to the Supreme Being, and does not come under the control of State enactments. The only office of civil government relating thereto is to “bold its hands off”—*Selected.*
