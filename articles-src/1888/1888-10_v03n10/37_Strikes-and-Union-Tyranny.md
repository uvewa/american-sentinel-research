The newspapers report the proposed removal of a prominent chimney glass manufactory from Pittsburgh to Belgium. One of the reasons given for removal is the continual recurrence of strikes among the men employed here. A member of the manufacturing firm is reported as saying: "Just at the present time our works are lying idle and the men are sitting around and taking it easy. We want to be at work, and so do at least three-quarters of the men, but on account of the union not a single man dare go to work, nor do we dare to start up. It is just this condition of affairs that has almost decided us to pull up stakes and leave." We shall not be surprised to hear of more of these removals in the near future. It must come to this or something worse if the business of "striking" is not brought to an end. It is a humiliating state of affairs outlined in the statement that three-fourths of the men in the glass manufactory desire to go to work, "but on account of the union not a single man *dare* go to work, nor do we *dare* to start up." Is there any tyranny in the land like this "union" tyranny? How can any industry succeed that is subject to it?—*New York Observer.*
