"THE new Citizens' Movement in the city of New York, for ousting Tammany Hall from the control of city affairs, fell into a serious error," says the *Christian Advocate,* "in using Archbishop Corrigan's name. Not only did they place his name in the list of clergymen who support the movement, but put him at the head of a committee of clergymen, one of whose members is a Catholic priest who is in a contentious attitude toward his church. The committee has been ordered to withdraw it at once. It now appears his name was used in the first place without securing his consent, but simply on the theory that he was favorable to the movement. Such use of any man's name is an imposition. Never without express consent given after full opportunity of reading the document, should any person's name be signed to it." There is a good deal too much of that sort of thing done, and nowhere is it more common than among those who attempt to engineer political matters from a religious standpoint. Such unwarranted use of names is very common with the National Reformers. It is not at all reassuring to know that the Citizens' Movement has been guilty of it in the very outset of the cause of reform. Moral reformers should be scrupulously honest.
