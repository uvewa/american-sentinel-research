A WESTERN religious paper has the following criticism of Colonel Shepard's evening paper, which is worth repeating:—

"The New York *Mail and Express, *that great champion of the Sunday cause, which deplores so greatly the desecration of Sunday, by Sunday trains and excursions, whose editor is President of the American Sabbath Union, makes speeches against Sunday profanation, and publishes in his paper, free of charge, a Sunday department, called 'The Pearl of Days,' in which all Sunday pleasuring is condemned, and all abettors thereto denounced,—in its issue of an 'extra,' Saturday evening, August 16, 1890 (which, of course, was intended to be read on Sunday), prints on its first page the following notice:—

## Sunday By Ocean's Shore.

*The Central Railroad of New Jersey and Sandy Hook Route carry you there.*

> With such admirable facilities for visiting the shore on Sunday as are afforded by the Central Railroad of New Jersey, both by their all-rail route and the Sandy Hook steamers, the traveler in search of rest by the sea can readily gratify the wish, and that, too, at an exceedingly modest outlay of money. The beauties of the seashore in midsummer are manifest, and make such a day's outing a happy one.

> Sunday boats leave Pier 8, North River, foot of Rector street, at 9:30 A. M,, and 1:00 P. M., for Atlantic Highlands, Highland Beach, Seabright, Long Branch, etc.
> Sunday trains leave ferry, foot of Liberty street, at 4:00 and 9:00 A. M., and 4:00 P. M.—Adv.
"We presume the 'adv.' means advertisement. Now, what did the New York *Mail and Express* publish this for? Was it for the good of the Sunday cause, or for the money there is in it? There can be but one answer. It will publish on one page for money what on another page it denounces as immoral and a sin against God. Where is the principle? How much dependence can be put on such editors? and how deep is their religion? Perhaps Colonel Shepard has not read far enough in his Bible yet to get to the text which says that ' he that biddeth him Godspeed is partaker of his evil deeds.' 2 John, 11. Mr. Knowles, who conducts the 'Pearl of Days ' department, might now with propriety give the *Mail and Express* a scathing rebuke, and the editor of the paper himself tell what a wicked thing it is."
