THOSE who are being seduced into the support of Sunday laws by the "civil Sabbath" plea, should make a note of these words from the *Christian Advocate, *of this city:—

> To open the fair on the Sabbath would be to offer an open indignity to all the Christian people of America. They all consider the Sabbath a holy day set apart for religious purposes. They consider themselves bound to keep it holy.

There is not much "civil Sabbath" about that. The "civil Sabbath" which Mr. Crafts has been proclaiming all over the land is simply "a good enough Morgan" till the desired legislation is secured. Then the mask will be thrown aside, and it will be seen that we have laws compelling people who are not religious to act, in some things at least, as though they were.
