HON. H. SCOTT HOWELL, in the June *Evangel of Rest*, says:—

> The Divine, with infinite wisdom, requires us to "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy;" and every citizen, however humble he may be, whether rich or poor, whether black or white, who in obedience to this divine law, engages in acts of devotion and worship, in his own home or in the public assembly, may do so in this free country "with none to molest or make him afraid."

Referring to Mr. Howell's words, a Des Moines, Iowa, paper asks the following pertinent questions:—

> If the above is true, what force is there in the pathetic appeals of the American Sabbath Union to Congress for laws to give the poor laboring man a chance to rest, and go to church? And if all, rich or poor, black or white, *may, if they will*, obey the divine law of the Sabbath, "with none to molest or make them afraid," what is the object of all this clamor for Sabbath legislation?
