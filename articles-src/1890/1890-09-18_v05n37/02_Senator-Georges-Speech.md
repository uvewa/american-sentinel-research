# Senator George’s Speech.

LAST week we gave Senator Reagan’s speech on the Indian Appropriation bill. We now give the speech of Senator George, of Mississippi, on the same subject. It is brief, but strictly to the point.

*Mr*.* President:* I rise principally for the purpose of endorsing, in all its length and breadth and depth, the very fine argument made by the Senator from Texas [Mr. Reagan] in opposition to any scheme by which the money of the people of the United States, shall be appropriated to any particular denomination of Christians for the purpose of educating, civilizing, and Christianizing Indians. 1 believe that the Constitution of the United States is violated in spirit when that is done. The First Amendment says that, “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” I believe we do our duty to the Indians, in the way of education, when we do for them what we do for the white people, and the black people of this country, giving them State education without reference to religious tenets. Whenever the Government embarks upon a scheme of that sort, we have, what has so manifestly appeared to-day, a contest between the various religious denominations of this country, as to who shall get the most. I am opposed to the whole scheme.

There is a denomination of Christians in this land, a very large denomination, probably as large as any other, who believe that the interference by Government with the teaching or establishment of the doctrines of any particular religious sect is wrong, and who, therefore, from conscientious scruples refuse to receive any money of the Government to teach any Indian school, or to go into the business at all. That denomination is the Baptist denomination. I think we shall do well when we adhere strictly in practice to that line of action.

[At this point, Senator Call, of Florida, spoke, endorsing the action of the Government in giving money to the churches, and attempted to make it appear that the opposition to the appropriation was only opposition to Catholics, to which Senator George replied, as follows:—ED.]

*Mr. President:* I do not intend to allow the Senator from Florida, to state in his own way, the position of those of us who oppose the appropriation of money, out of the Treasury of the United States, for the purpose of keeping up these schools. He stated that our opposition was based upon the ground that the Catholics had the schools. I repudiate that sentiment, sir, entirely; I do not care whether the school is kept by Catholics or any one of the Protestant denominations, it is no part of the business of Congress to take people’s money for the purpose of having denominational schools. Denominational schools ought to be kept up by the denominations which own them, and they are kept up in that way all over the United States, for all the population of the United States, except only, for the Indians.

I desire simply to say that much. The Senator from Florida, wholly misinterprets the views and the sentiments of those who oppose these appropriations. I would as soon vote for an appropriation for one sort of a denominational school as for another. I am opposed to all of them. Not to the school, but to their being sustained by taxes collected from the people of the United States.
