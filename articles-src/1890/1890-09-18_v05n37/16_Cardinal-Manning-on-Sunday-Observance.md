A LONDON despatch says that Cardinal Manning has written a letter to the Social Science Congress, in session at Liege, Belgium, urging among other things, that the observance of Sunday be enforced. At every public gathering, both in this country and Europe, where it is possible to present and advocate the claims of Sunday for legal acknowledgment and enforced observance, ministers and prelates of ability and eminence, in church circles, are found ready to press the subject with all their power and subtilty. It cannot be long before the result of this will become so evident that even the wayfaring men, who are absorbed in running the world's race, will be able to read the signs of the times.
