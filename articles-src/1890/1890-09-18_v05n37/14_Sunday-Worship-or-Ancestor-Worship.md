THE Rev. Frank Dixon, pastor of the Tenth Avenue Baptist Church, Oakland, in a recent sermon on "The Sabbath," touched the heart of the greater part of the fancied devotion to Sunday, in the following words:—

> Was our religion so inseparable from the Sunday of our fathers that it vanished with the desecration of that day? Going down to the bottom of the matter, have we been worshiping a day or Jesus Christ? Then, too, we cannot help asking ourselves if a large part of the reverence with which we have viewed Sunday has not been rendered to our fathers who bequeathed us the day, rather than to any sanctity which we discovered in the day.

It is ancestor-worship instead of devotion to the day for its own sake, in a large degree. Mr. Dixon does not believe that Sunday is any more sacred than any other day, but that all days are alike; but yet he finds ground for State Sunday laws. Great is consistency, but greater yet is custom.—*Signs of the Times.*
