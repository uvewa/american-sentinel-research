AN Iowa paper, favorable to the objects of the National Religious Liberty Association, has the following note:—

> Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts gave three lectures in Des Moines, Sunday, and one, Monday evening. His coming was a surprise, his announcements not being made till within a few hours before he delivered his first address. Our readers understand the object of such a course, but they may be assured that Rev. Crafts's hearers will be bountifully supplied with National Religious Liberty reading-matter, even if the distribution has to *follow* the lectures.

It is hard for Mr. Crafts to kick against the pricks, but he may as well make up his mind that he cannot have a monopoly of teaching upon the Sunday-law question. If he believes his cause just, he should not fear full and free discussion.
