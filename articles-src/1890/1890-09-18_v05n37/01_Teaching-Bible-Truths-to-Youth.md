THE priceless truths of the Bible are best taught to our youth in the church, the Sabbath and the parochial schools, the social and religious meetings, and above all, by parents in the home circle. There these truths may be explained and enforced, the spiritual welfare of the child guarded and protected, and his spiritual nature directed and cultivated in accordance with the dictates of the parental conscience.—*Judge Lyon*,* of Wisconsin.*
