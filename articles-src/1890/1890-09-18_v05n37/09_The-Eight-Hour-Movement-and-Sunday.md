IN discussing the eight-hour movement and the success which is attending it, the *Observer,* of this city, says:—

> This labor day of eight hours has an important bearing on the interests and obligations of the holy Sabbath. Though it gives more time for rest and recreation during the week, it does not lessen the desirability and necessity of one day of complete rest from ordinary labor. Eight hours a day of thorough work during six successive days, will make one day of entire repose from physical and mental toil a genuine relief and benefit. But eight full hours of freedom in every day of the week completely destroys the argument for making Sunday a mere holiday. It is a national disaster for a people to become so frivolous and pleasure-loving, that they cannot devote one day in seven to actual rest and serious occupation. When Sunday is used by one-half the population in labor that may provide the other half with amusements, this country will be ready to rank in moral, and spiritual force, with a South American republic. Eight hours a day for labor removes every shadow of an excuse for popular attacks on the Sabbath on the ground that labor has no other time for recreation. That labor which is confined to eight hours has more opportunity for amusement of every kind, than other large divisions of humanity.

This shows the true animus of the whole Sunday movement. It is true that the leaders in the present national Sunday crusade, are professedly working for a civil Sunday, a day in which the poor working man may rest; but it is none the less true that their inspiration is found in the fact that they have a religious regard for the day, and are determined that others shall at least act as though they also regard it as sacred. They are simply seeking governmental recognition of a religious institution.
