THE Cleveland correspondent of the *Christian Advocate*, of this city, writes to that paper, as follows:—

> The Epworth League continues the effort to secure a Christian Sabbath for Cleveland. The enemies are strongly intrenched, and it is being realized that resolutions and spasms are not very effective. It is now proposed to secure the co-operation of all the young people's societies in all the churches in the city, not excepting the Roman Catholic, and to direct the effort so far as possible to secure the election of men to official places who will enforce the law. It was of the Acts of the Apostles that Luke wrote, and we shall be glad to report further acts of this aggressive League.

This paragraph is interesting as showing the progress that the Sunday cause is making, and the efforts that are being put forward in its behalf. Just what force there is in the reference to the fact that Luke wrote the Acts of the Apostles we confess that we do not see.
