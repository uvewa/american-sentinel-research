WHATEVER may be true of Protestants in other lands, the Protestants of the United States are unqualifiedly opposed to any union of Church and State, even such a union as is involved when the State undertakes to give the simplest instruction in religion. But it becomes evident that, if the State is going to undertake to give complete education to all its citizens, one of two things must follow: either there must be no religious instruction and we must rear generations of agnostics and atheists, or else it must teach doctrines against which a considerable portion of the citizens protest. Neither of these things ought to be. It is the business of the Christian people of this land, and of any land, to see to it that the atmosphere breathed by their children, while acquiring the education which is to fit them for the present life, be such as shall conduce to their religious as well as to their mental growth, that heart and mind be cultivated at the same time.—*Journal and Messenger (Baptist),* *Cincinnati.*
