THERE is no law to prevent a barber or any other tradesman from resting on Sunday, or any other day of the week. There are several shops in Denver which close every Sunday, and have been following this custom for a year or more. Public sympathy is with the man who does what he believes is right. The way to close is to shut up shop on Sunday. If any number of barbers favor Sunday rest they should take it. Others will follow. Daniels & Fisher close at 6 P. M. every day, without reference to what other dealers do. The *Graphic* closes early on Saturday, often at noon, without regard to what other printing offices do. Enforced Sunday rest is wrong. Every man knows his own business best, and he should not be interfered with as long as he does not interfere with his neighbors.—*Colorado Graphic.*
