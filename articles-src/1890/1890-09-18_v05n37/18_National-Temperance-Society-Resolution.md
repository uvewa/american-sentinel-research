AT a regular meeting of the Board of Managers of the National Temperance Society, held recently in New York, the following resolution was passed, and the Secretary directed To transmit a copy to the Commissioners of the World's Fair, at Chicago:—

> *Resolved,* That the Board of Managers of the National Temperance Society, in behalf of its membership throughout the Nation, earnestly protests against the opening of the World's Fair on the Sabbath day.

Is the National Temperance Society about to swing into line with the National Reform Party? The Sunday Union, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, the King's Daughters, the Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor, are already bound in the political compact. If the National Temperance Society joins the great conspiracy against religious freedom and Christianity undefiled, the only organizations still remaining neutral will be the Young Men's Christian Association, the Salvation Army, the Labor Unions, and the secret societies.

It may be said that this resolution is intended to be in the interest of temperance. It is not so worded. But if so, it is time the National Temperance Society learned that it cannot associate itself with the movement to enforce religious formality by civil measures, and establish, in any degree, an enforced political religion, and at the same time expect to serve acceptably, either God or the cause of temperance.
