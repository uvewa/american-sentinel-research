"WE demand," say the California Sunday-law advocates, "the enactment and enforcement of an intelligent and rational Sunday law, making one day in seven a rest day, and especially do we demand that all places of secular business be closed on that day, and we further demand that suitable penalties be enacted for the enforcement of the same." To prohibit *secular* business is to permit *religious;* this is therefore a demand that the State give religion a monopoly of one day in the week; and yet we are assured by these gentlemen of elastic veracity that they are demanding civil legislation only!
