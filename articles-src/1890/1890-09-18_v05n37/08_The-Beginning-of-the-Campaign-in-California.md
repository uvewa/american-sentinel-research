# The Beginning of the Campaign in California.

THE American Sabbath Union must feel of California, as Cardinal Manning once expressed himself of England:—

> If ever there was a land in which work was to be done, it is here. I shall not say too much if I say that we have to subjugate and subdue, to conquer and rule, an imperial race. . . . Were heresy conquered in England, it would be conquered throughout the world. All its lines meet here, and therefore in England the church of God [Ro man Catholic] must be gathered in its strength.

Substitute California for England, and American Sabbath Union for the Roman Catholic Church, and the above quotation is befitting language for Sunday-law advocates just now. Prior to 1883, California had a dead-letter Sunday law which was then repealed. Since then Sundaylaw advocates have continually mourned and threatened, because California “is the only State without a Sunday law.” The American Sabbath Union, last year, sent its best man, Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts. He organized numerous auxiliary societies and departed. He has again visited the State—a few months ago. Mrs. J. C. Bateham, Dr. W. W. Atterbury, of New York Sabbath fame, and Bishop Newman, are also on the Coast, but Sabbath laws are not yet.

Mrs. Bateham has given two lectures, recently, in Oakland, which were very slimly attended. She presented nothing new, and the old arguments were put in a remarkably weak form. An instance, and as telling an argument as she used, was that based on the stability of the Republic. Its foundation, she contended, was the Sabbath. Of course, concrete arguments are worth more than abstract, so the lady presented before us the two republics of France and the United States. The former sabbathless, the latter founded on the Sabbath; the former unstable, the latter stable. This would all have been good if her premise had been true, that a Sabbath-keeping nation was the only stable nation. But in the first place the United States has not been a Sabbathkeeping nation, and in the second place, the illustration as regards France, is of no worth in the light of opposite facts. Rome existed as a sabbathless republic, for five hundred years before Christ, and as a sabbathless imperialism more than two hundred years after. As a sabbathless republic she conquered the world. Under the last of her mighty emperors she became infected with that malignant plague—a Sunday law. According to Mrs. Bateham, right there, Rome’s greatness and stability ought to have begun, but the facts are that the Sunday law of Constantine, was but a prelude to Rome’s instability and destruction as a nation of unity and strength.

Another point, perhaps worthy of notice, was concerning the District of Columbia, another poor spot of earth without a Sunday law. The surprising fact, in connection with the matter, however, is this: That for years and years the District was without a Sunday law, and those dear people knew nothing about it till they searched the records. Yet the District of Columbia, daring all that time, was one of the civilized spots of earth; it had grown apace; its people had lived, had worshiped, had died, many of them in hope. They had kept their Sabbath as good as in all other cities, except, perhaps, when the Federal Congress was there convened from the several Sundaylaw States. And yet, the good people of Washington knew not they were so “disgraced” till our zealous Sunday-law agitators began their hunt. Poor Washington!

Another convention, of the American Sabbath Union, was held at the Young Men’s Christian Association rooms in San Francisco, August 16 and 18, under the direction of the District Secretary of the Pacific Coast, Rev. Edward Thompson, LL. D. It was a poorly managed affair. It was announced two weeks previous, but the place was not given, and then nothing more was heard of it till the first day had passed. Even the officers of the association, Dr. Abbott, Rev. N. R. Johnson, and Mrs. J. C. Bateham knew nothing of the meeting. Mrs. Bateham was not present at all. It was a union meeting in only one respect, all wanted a Sunday law of some kind. The spirit of the gathering was well illustrated in Acts 19:32 “Some cried one thing and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.” Yet all could cry as regards some kind of a Sunday law, “Great is Diana of the Ephesians.”

“The Sabbath in the Home,” was discussed by Rev. M. M. Gibson (United Presbyterian), and he said some very good things. “If the Sabbath is in the home,” he declared, “it will be in the church and in the State.” He stated most truly that there was no more religion in the church than there was in the home; and that if the Sabbath were in the home, it would pervade society and the State. And this contains the whole thing in a nutshell. If the Sabbath were in the homes of the people, there would be no need of Sabbath laws. On this point Dr. Gibson is sound, and the argument makes of none effect the Sabbath laws which he pleaded for in a half-hearted manner; again making of none effect his plea for law by returning to his original argument. The law he claimed would go no farther in restricting power, than the influence of home gave it that power.

Akin to the above topic was another: “Keep the Sabbath yourself.” It was argued by Dr. Stewart that it was absolutely impossible to enact or enforce Sabbath laws while professed Christians were so apathetic. The real trouble exists with church members.

“Sunday laws not Oppressive,” was discussed by Rev. J. A. Q. Henry (Baptist). He argued, from the following reasons, that they were not oppressive: 1. The Sabbath was a physical necessity. 2. The Sabbath was a necessity from an economic standpoint. 3. It was a necessity from an ethical standpoint. 4. It was a religious necessity. *Ergo* by a fourfold necessity, Sabbath laws were not oppressive. But Government has no right to enjoin a religious observance of the day, but to protect its citizens in their right to worship. Mr. Henry’s conclusion no more followed from his premises, than figs could be expected from thistles. Every argument he adduced in favor of his position could be urged in favor of a law to regulate sleep. A proper amount of sleep is a physical and economical, an ethical, and a religious (civil) necessity; therefore, laws to regulate sleep, and we may also say, food and dress, are not oppressive. It is difficult to say whether pity for the man, or contempt for his so-called arguments, is the predominating emotion in listening to such puerilities. One man asked would it oppress the Jews?—No. Provision was always made for them and Sabbatarians, with the exception of laws of one State, Kansas, he believed. This is an indication of the ignorance of many able men upon this subject. A few facts, like the persecutions in Pennsylvania, Arkansas, and Tennessee, are worth a thousand such arguments. Sunday laws are *not* oppressive when they are allowed to become dead letters, as they are in most of our States, but when in operation and enforced they are *always *oppressive, as has been demonstrated times without number.

Dr. Atterbury, of New York, urged the convention to confine the question to the civil, secular Sabbath alone, and drop every other issue. Dr. Abbott made a very vigorous speech on the same line. He said the California Legislature, he [279] thought, would entertain a purely secular Sabbath bill, but it would do no good to ask for any other. If men were afraid of losing their religion in asking for such a bill, they had better keep away from Sacramento.

Dr. John Thompson (general Bible agent for the Pacific Coast), described the quiet Sabbath he spent in Virginia City, Nevada. Five saloons were running, but there were no places of business open. He returned to California sick at heart, because we in California had no Christian Sabbath, and this he repeated several times. Your correspondent, in conversation with him afterward, expressed surprise at the statement, and asked Mr. Thompson if he did not keep what he believed to be the “Christian Sabbath?” “Why, certainly,” was the reply. “How is it then,” was asked, “you have no Christian Sabbath here in California?” The Legislature, he said, had not given them one. “Then,” it was asked, “do you receive your religion and religious institutions, and matters of faith, from the Legislature?” It is to such pitiable shifts that the logic of their madness drives them.

In the evening, a mass-meeting was addressed by Miss Corabel Tarr, of Chicago, Dr. Edward Thompson (District Secretary), and Bishop John P. Newman, of New York. Bishop Newman urged that the issue be made on a non-secular day, a day of rest. Dr. Thompson gave a glowing account of what had been accomplished in Southern California in. the closing of saloons on Sunday. Miss Tarr spoke of women’s work in the Sunday movement.

The strength of the Sunday cause is not to be estimated by these illy - managed meetings. While there is much division in the ranks in many respects, to all, great is the *disideratum *of some kind of a Sunday law. It will require some effort to convert California, but as Mrs. Bateham said, “the leaven is working,” the baleful, poisonous, corrupting influence of religious legislation. M. C. WILCOX.

THE *Loyal American* well says that “the divorce between State and Church should be absolute,” and that “to complete the divorce, all churches and other religious property should be taxed.” [280]

GOVERNOR HOARD has been renominated and the Bennett law re-affirmed by the Wisconsin Republicans. The Democrats have nominated Geo. W. Peck, and declared against the Bennett law. The action of the Republicans in indorsing the Bennett law is to be deplored, for it is certainly unworthy of the support of either of the great parties.

THE purpose to thoroughly secularize the Government of Brazil, is shown in the provisions of the new Constitution, making civil marriages compulsory, prohibiting any support of the Church by the State, the control of cemeteries by any religious bodies, the teaching of religion in the public schools, the residence of Jesuits in the country, and the founding of new monastic orders. It will now be in order for National Reformers and Roman Catholics to unite in denouncing Brazil as “ atheistic,” and her statesmen as the “enemies of all religion.”

THE *Christian at Work* says: “Our Sunday laws are undoubtedly based upon feeling rather than laid along logical lines.” Yet in the same connection it attempts to justify the enforcement of such laws! Referring to this fact, a Western paper says: “Logic is reason; therefore to say that Sunday laws are not laid along logical lines, is to say that there is no reason in them. And in this age of boasted enlightenment, people will plead for rigid laws, against reason. The pitiful part of the matter is that while the laws themselves are based upon feeling, they are usually enforced with a total lack of feeling.”

JOSEPH COOK says: “I hold that the Sabbath is recognized in the Constitution of the United States, for the President is required to sign bills within so many days Sundays excepted. Every one of us is entitled to the same day’s rest that he is. Still, so far as the State is concerned, I do not believe in enforcing the religious observance of the Sabbath, but only as a day of rest and quiet.”

But there is no law to *prevent* the President from signing bills upon Sunday if he desires to do so. There is, whether Mr. Cook acknowledges the fact or not, a vast difference between *forbidding* a man to do work on Sunday, and providing that he shall not be *required* to do any. California recognizes Sunday more fully than does the Constitution of the United States, and yet, Mr. Crafts and Mr. Cook, as well as a host of lesser Sunday-law lights constantly complain that that State has no Sunday law. They would not be satisfied with a statute declaring Sunday *dies non.*

REFERRING to those who demand the abolition of capital punishment, because of the scenes accompanying the first electrical execution, in this State, the *Christian Advocate* says: “They may succeed, for this is an age of sentimentality and ‘legislation by hurricane.’” This agrees exactly with the utterance of the *Christian at Work* concerning Sunday laws, namely, that such laws “are undoubtedly based upon feeling, rather than laid along logical lines.” This is true; we have legislation by clamor, and trial by clamor, and too often the only thing back of the clamor is a sickly sentimentalism as utterly foreign to sound reason as ice is to equatorial Africa.

THE *Pearl of Days* says that, “the Catholic clergy of Los Angeles, California, have joined with other citizens in the following petition:”—

> To the Los Angeles City Council:

> The undersigned earnestly petition your honorable body so to amend or enlarge our city ordinance that the saloons shall be closed not only on election days, but also on Sundays. In this movement, for the moral benefit of the people, we wish the public to understand that we are influenced by no political partisanship.
> FRANCIS MORA, Bishop.
> J. ADAM, Vicar-General, and all the other Roman Catholic clergymen of this city.
This is not to be wondered at, since the Baltimore Council declared in favor of *high license* and Sunday closing. The two measures are cut from the same web, namely, compromise with the saloon. They alike delay the final abolition of the evil.

IN a recent appeal in behalf of that society, Ida C. Craddock, Corresponding Secretary of the American Secular Union, says: “How mistaken is your action in refusing to join the army of the American Secular Union, which is waging the only organized warfare against these would-be uniters of Church and State!”

Has the Secretary never heard of the work of the National Religious Liberty Association? With all due deference to the Secular Union, we must say that in the single year of its existence, the Religious Liberty Association has done more effective work against the “would-be uniters of Church and State,” in this country, than the Secular Union has ever done in twice the time, or ever can do; and this, for the simple reason that too much of the work of the Union takes the form of opposition to religion; while the Religious Liberty Association bases its opposition to Church and State union, upon the inalienable right of every man to profess any religion or no religion as he may elect, and that, absolutely free from any sort of State interference.

A FEW weeks ago, a five-year-old boy was run over, in the streets of this city, and had both his legs crushed. Subsequently his father made application to one of the courts, to be appointed guardian for his own child, for the purpose of bringing a suit for damages, in behalf of the injured boy. The father’s application was denied, on the ground that he was not worth fifty dollars. It was shown that this father was a sober, industrious man, but that made not the slightest difference; he lacked the necessary property qualification, and could not, under the law as interpreted by the court, be permitted to enter suit in behalf of his minor child. Comment upon such a law is unnecessary. Every lover of justice and liberty will be able to characterize such a law himself, better than we could possibly do it. To say that it belongs with the most objectionable kind of class legislation, and that it is monstrously unjust is to put it very mildly.

“THE school question,” says the *Catholic Review, *“is breeding difficulties with every hour. Following the troubles in Massachusetts, and Wisconsin, comes the news from Ohio, that a Catholic pastor in Toledo, has been indicted by the Grand Jury, ‘for misdemeanor, or for neglecting to report pupils to the Board of Education.’ There is an Ohio law, a meddlesome, impertinent law, of the same stamp as the Wisconsin Bennett law, conceived in the same spirit of malice, envy, and hatred, which requires all schools, public and private, to make a regular report to Boards of Education in each district, of the names of the pupils, ages, and so on. Acting under legal advice, the Toledo priest refused to make such returns from his private school, and his consequent arrest will test the constitutionality of the law, and make trouble for Ohio fanatics. These irritating questions are going to multiply.” [281]
