"CURIOUS proposition that," says the *World,* "to make Texas fever non-contagious and non-infectious, by a Congressional vote. Some people think Congress is like Parliament, able to do anything but make a man a woman." But curious as is such a proposition, it is neither more curious nor more absurd than is the National Reform proposition to make this a Christian nation, by inserting in the Constitution a complimentary mention of God.
