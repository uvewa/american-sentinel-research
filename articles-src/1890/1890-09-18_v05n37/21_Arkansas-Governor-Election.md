THE result of the recent election in one of the Southern States, is thus announced by the *Sun:—*

> The Hon. James P. Eagle, Democrat and Baptist, was elected Governor of Arkansas, yesterday, defeating the Hon. Napoleon Bonaparte Fizer, Union Labor, Republican, and Methodist.

We may as well get used to this sort of thing, for should the hopes of the National Reformers be realized, the religion professed by the various candidates will become a matter of more than passing curiosity.
