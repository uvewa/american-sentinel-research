THE *Sun*, of this city, notes the fact that there were two meetings in Chicago, on a recent Sunday, to protest against opening the World's Fair on Sundays, and remarks upon it that "this seems somewhat premature and immature. It is far from certain as yet, that the World's Fair will be open on week days. The Chicago Sabbatarians are tugging at Time's forelock most unnecessarily." It would appear that the self-instituted Sabbath Observance Department, of the World's Columbian Exposition, is trying to prove the truth of the old adage, "It is better to be ready and not go; than to go and not be ready."
