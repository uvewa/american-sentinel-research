THE late German Catholic Congress, held at Coblentz, adopted resolutions demanding "the re-establishment in Germany of all the Catholic orders, including the Jesuits, and the restoration of the Pope's temporal power." "These demands," says the *Catholic Review,* "are significant in Germany to the party suffering, because of their inherent justice to the party governing, because of the fact that six thousand Germans met in congress to make them." Yes, they are significant, but not for the reasons given by the *Review;* they are significant because in every country Roman Catholics are exerting a greater influence than ever before in the present century; and the end is not yet. Of the proposed Catholic Congress to be held in Chicago in 1893, the *Review* says:—

> Let us get 10,000 representative Catholics together in Chicago in 1893, and if they will have the courage of their German co-religionists, the courage to *demand* their rights and the rights of the Holy Father, well and good. If they will not, then let us bow our heads before the nobler, greater, braver Germans.

They will not lack the "courage," but it is to be feared that those who stand at the head of our Government will lack the courage to resist as they should the encroachments of Rome in this country; and not only so, but already evidences are not lacking, as witnessed by the congressional appropriations to Catholic schools, to show that the demands of Rome are not less potent in this country than in some of the nations of the Old World.
