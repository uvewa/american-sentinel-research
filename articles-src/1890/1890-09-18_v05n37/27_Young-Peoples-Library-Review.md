ONE of the neatest and best books which we have seen in a long time, is "Jottings from the Pacific. Fiji and Samoa." By Emma H. Adams, author of "To and Fro in Southern California," and "Up and Down in Oregon and Washington." This book, which is handsomely illustrated, is printed in large clear type, on excellent paper, and is substantially bound in cloth, beautifully embossed in jet and gold. It contains 160 pages of not only absolutely unobjectionable, but highly interesting and profitable matter, descriptive of Fiji and Samoa, and giving glimpses of native life in those interesting islands. No parent can do better than to place such books in the hands of his children, and thus cultivate in them a taste for good reading.

This book is the initial number of the "Young People's Library," and judging from this number and from the promises of the publishers, we feel confident that this library will greatly assist thousands of anxious parents to answer with satisfaction to themselves, and profit to their children, the vexed question, "What shall our children read?"

The "Young People's Library" will be issued monthly, each volume containing 160 pages of uniform size, in two styles of binding, namely, paper, and cloth embossed in jet and gold. The subscription price is $2.75 per year, for the paper, and $5.50 for the cloth binding. Single copies are twenty-five and fifty cents, respectively. Pacific Press, Oakland, Cal., New York, N. Y., and London, England. [297]
