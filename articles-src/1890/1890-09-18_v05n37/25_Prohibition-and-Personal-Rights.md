WE are asked if we wish our readers to understand that we think that all drinking of intoxicating beverages should be abolished? and if we would carry prohibition so far as to forbid the use of intoxicating wine in the holy communion? We will simply say that we are opposed to the liquor traffic, and believe that there are ample civil reasons why the State should abolish the saloon; but just how* far* prohibition should be carried, we are not prepared to say; that is, our study of the matter does not qualify us to speak *excathedra* upon so difficult a question. It seems to us, however, that to prohibit the traffic in alcoholic beverages, and their manufacture for the purpose of traffic, is about all the State could justly do. It would seem that to carry prohibition to the length intimated by our correspondent, would be an unwarranted invasion not only of religious rights, but of proper personal, civil rights.
