# The Bible and Public Schools.

WE have read, with hearty approval, the opinions recently delivered in the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, in regard to the question of the Bible in the public schools of that State, the full text of which has been published in the Albany *Law Journal.* This reading only confirms our opinion of this decision as heretofore expressed.

Mr. Justice Lyon delivered the opinion of the Court; and Messrs. Justices Cassoday and Orton delivered concurring opinions. The case before the Court was that of a petition for a *mandamus,* commanding the School Board in the city of Edgerton to cause the teachers in one of the public schools of that city to discontinue the practice of reading, during school hours, portions of the King James version of the Bible. The petitioners for the *mandamus* were residents and tax-payers in Edgerton, and presumptively Catholics in their religious faith, although this fact is not stated in these deliverances. They complained of the practice above referred to.

This petition brought squarely before the Court the question whether such a practice is consistent with the Constitution of the State of Wisconsin; and this question the Court unanimously answered in the negative. And, that our readers may the better understand the case, we submit in the following order the several points decided:

1. The first point is the construction of Article X, Section 3, of the Constitution of the State, which declares that “the Legislature shall provide by law for the establishment of district schools, which shall be as nearly uniform as practicable, and such schools shall be free and without charge for tuition to all children between the ages of four, and twenty years, and *no sectarian instruction shall be allowed therein.”* The Court held that the reading of the King James version of the Bible in public schools of the State during school hours, is “sectarian instruction” within the meaning of this constitutional prohibition, and hence inconsistent therewith. [212] Mr. Justice Lyon said that the prohibition “manifestly refers exclusively to instruction in *religious* doctrines,” and in such doctrines as “are believed by some religious sects and rejected by others.” The Court took judicial knowledge of the fact that the King James version of the Bible is not accepted and used by *all *“religious sects” in Wisconsin, but is accepted by some of these sects and rejected by others. Hence, as between them, all having the same constitutional rights, the Court held that version to be a “sectarian” book, and the reading of it in the manner and for the purpose set forth in the complaint to be forbidden by the Constitution of the State.

How any other conclusion could have been drawn from the premises, we are not able to see. We presume that there is not a Protestant in Wisconsin who would hesitate a moment on the point, if the book read had been the Douay version of the Bible which is acceptable to Catholics, or the Koran, or the Book of Mormon. The reading of such a book as a part of school exercise, whether for worship or religious instruction, would be offensive to Protestants, and they would have good cause for complaint, just as the reading of the King James version, which is sometimes called the Protestant Bible, is offensive to Catholics. It should not be forgotten that, under the Constitution of Wisconsin, Catholics and Protestants have on this subject precisely the same rights, and that neither can claim any precedence over the other. The Constitution of that State makes no distinction between them, and determines no question relating to their differences, or any other religious differences. It deals with all the people simply as *citizens,* no matter what may be their religious tenets, or whether they have any such tenets.

2. The second point decided is that “the practice of reading the Bible in such schools can receive no sanction, from the fact that pupils are not compelled to remain in the school while it is being read.” On this point we quote, as follows, the language of Mr. Justice Lyon:—

> When, as in this case, a small minority of the pupils in the public school is excluded, for any cause, from a stated school exercise, particularly when such cause is apparent hostility to the Bible, which a majority of the pupils have been taught to revere, from that moment the excluded pupil loses caste with his fellows, and is liable to be regarded with aversion, and subjected to reproach and insult. But it is a sufficient refutation of the argument that the practice in question tends to destroy the equality of the pupils which the Constitution seeks to establish and protect, and puts a portion of them at a serious disadvantage in many ways with respect to any others.

The plain fact is that *not* to compel the attendance, upon such reading, of the children of parents who object to it, for the sake of continuing the reading, is a virtual confession that the reading has a “sectarian” character, as between those who desire it and those who object to it. It is merely an attempt to get round what is apparent on the face of the case.

3. The third point decided is that “the reading of the Bible is an act of worship, as that term is defined in the Constitution; and hence the tax-payers of any district who are compelled to contribute to the erection and support of common schools, have the right to object to the reading of the Bible, under the Constitution of Wisconsin, Article I, section 18, clause 2, declaring that no man shall be compelled to. . . erect or support any place of worship.” This provision is in what is called the “Declaration of Rights.” The opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Cassoday on this point is, to our understanding, clear and conclusive. Bible-reading in public schools has the form and intention of religious worship; and this being the fact, then to compel the people by taxation to erect and support public schools, in which such reading is a practice, is to compel them by law to erect and support places of worship. The fact that these places are also used for other purposes does not relieve the difficulty. The Constitution expressly declares that the people shall not “be compelled to erect *any* place” that is used for the purpose of worship. To tax a man to erect and support a public school, and then to introduce the element of religious worship into that school, is to make a combination which the Constitution forbids.

4. The fourth point decided is that, “as the reading of the Bible at stated times in a common school is religious instruction, the money drawn from the State Treasury in support of such school is ‘for the benefit of a religious seminary,’ within the meaning of the Constitution of Wisconsin, Article 1, section 18, clause 4, prohibiting such an appropriation of the funds of the State.” The design of the clause referred to, is to prevent the State from using the public funds to defray the expenses of religious instruction; and this design is frustrated just as really when these funds are used to support common schools in which such instruction is given, as it would be if these funds were used to support “religious societies, or religious or theological seminaries.” Mr. Justice Cassoday in his opinion sets forth this point very clearly.

We have thus given the pith of the argument on this subject as stated by the three Justices of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin. We see no escape from the conclusion reached, and have no desire to escape it, since we thoroughly believe in its correctness everywhere. To the argument that “the exclusion of Bible reading from the district schools is derogatory to the value of the Holy Scriptures, a blow to their influence upon the conduct and consciences of men, and disastrous to the cause of religion,” Mr. Justice Lyon thus replied:—

> We most emphatically reject these views. The priceless truths of the Bible are best taught to our youth in the church, the Sabbath and the parochial schools, the social religious meetings, and, above all, by parents in the home circle. There these truths may be explained and enforced, the spiritual welfare of the child guarded and protected, and his spiritual nature directed and cultivated in accordance with the dictates of the parental conscience. The Constitution does not interfere with such teaching and culture.

The doctrine of the Constitution of Wisconsin, as thus settled by the Supreme Court of that State, is, in our judgment, the true doctrine for every State in the Union. It remits the question of religious instruction, as to what it shall be, as to the agency giving it, and as to the cost thereof, to voluntary, private, and individual effort, and devotes the public school, created and regulated by law, and supported by a general taxation of the people, exclusively to secular education. This principle is in harmony with the nature and structure of our political institutions, and is, moreover, just and equitable as between religious sects. It favors no one of them and proscribes no one of them; and while it leaves them all free to propagate their religious beliefs in their own way, and at their own expense, it gives to the whole people, at the cost of the whole, a system of popular education that is certainly good as far as it goes, and is *all* that the State can give, without itself becoming a religious propagandist. Catholics and Protestants alike ought to be satisfied with it. There is no other basis on which the school question can be justly settled as between different religious sects.—*N. Y. Independent.*
