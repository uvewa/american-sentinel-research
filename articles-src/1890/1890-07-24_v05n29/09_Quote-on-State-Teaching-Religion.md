SOME one may ask me: "If not for the good of the children, nor for the sake of religion, but for her own safety, should not the State teach religion?" Men and women of every possible shade of belief, and of every possible shade of non-belief down to zero of belief, make the State, and support the State, therefore the State can have no religion nor can she support any. If the State has no religion then how can she teach it?—*Rev*.* T*.* D*.* Peake*.
