# The Basis of Civil Sabbath Laws.

I LEARN from the *Christian Statesman *of May 29, that the editor, and Judge Hagan, of Cincinnati, Ohio, though agreed in the propriety and necessity of a civil Sabbath, differ from each other on the basis of such legislations. The Judge says, “No legislation on this subject, unless it is founded on some basis beside the Christian duty of observing a day of rest, can be justified. So keen and incisive was the intention of the founders of the Government to divorce the Church from the State, entirely and forever, that there cannot be, as there ought not to be, any legislation to enforce the performance of a Christian duty as such; but all laws must be founded on civil rights, duties, and obligations.”

But the editor argues that without the divine law for the Sabbath there would be no basis for a civil Sabbath law. He says, “The moment we depart from an immutable moral basis, that moment we are left adrift without compass or chart. The logic which runs us into such absurdity and such wickedness should show us that we must base our civil Sabbath laws on the divine law. This is where our ablest jurors have based them. Judge Flandrau, of the Supreme Court of Minnesota, declared that the Sabbath law of that State ‘can have no other object than the enforcement of the fourth of God’s commandments.’” The editor also quotes Judge Caldwell, of the Supreme Court of Texas, as saying that “the object of the legislation was to forbid all secular employments on the Sabbath, not excepted in the act. The disregard of the Sabbath, the refusal to recognize it as a day sanctified to holy purposes, constitutes the offense.”

Judge Hagan, to avoid the union of Church and State, would have the civil Sabbath based on reasons wholly outside of religious obligation; but the editor thinks such an idea absurd, and would have the civil Sabbath based on the command of God, so that it will reach men’s consciences, and so that “the refusal to recognize it as a day sanctified to holy purposes” will constitute the chief offense against the law. Any one can see that the enactment of such a law would be an effort to compel men to acknowledge the claims of the religion of the Bible, and of what they call the Christian Sabbath; and yet this is not religious legislation, but purely civil! But however they differ in regard to the basis on which to found it, in one thing they agree, and that is, we must have a “civil Sabbath.”

The advocates of error will differ widely in their premises, but still come to the same conclusion; but those who plead for truth are united in the reasons they offer in its support, because they are readymade, and they do not have to invent them.R. F. COTTRELL.
