# Religious Observance.

ON Monday night, June 16, the Rev. W. F. Crafts gave a lengthy lecture in Boulder, Colorado, on “The *Civil* American Sabbath.” He exhibited a chart and explained the physical detriment of continued labor, and enthusiastically spoke of the need and benefits of laws to better enforce the observance of this civil Sabbath. The *religious* Sabbath would not down, but kept continually coming to the front, all through the lecture. In the beginning of his speech he made the statement that all the States, excepting California, had Sunday laws, and in no State did these laws compel any religious observance. At the close of his lecture, one in the audience arose and asked, if a man observed the seventh day as a rest day, thus meeting all his physical necessities, and then on Sunday pursued his labor of such a nature and in such a place as to disturb no one, on what ground did Sunday laws fine him seventy-five dollars for so laboring? The speaker replied that he did not countenance the few cases of that kind which had occurred, but all Sunday laws should exempt those who kept the seventh day. It will be seen at once that this was an evasion of the point in question. What the law *should* do, and what it *did *do are very different things. The man was punished, not for disturbing his neighbors, for he did not disturb them; not for injuring himself by continuous toil, for he had rested the day before; it is therefore easy to see that the punishment inflicted by these laws was to compel the religious observance of Sunday. All Sunday legislation is religious legislation; and it is plain to be seen that any and every Sunday law, in any and every State, is for the sole purpose of enforcing the *religious observance of that day.* E. R. JONES.
