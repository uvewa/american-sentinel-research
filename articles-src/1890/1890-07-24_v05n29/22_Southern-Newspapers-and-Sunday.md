WRITING of the South, the editor of the Pittsfield, Massachusetts, *Call*, says:

> Church attendance is good and hotel bars and saloons have few or no back doors, so it is said. South of and including Richmond, you can obtain a Sunday paper, Sunday morning, but a Monday paper is not printed at all. The *Whig* and *Dispatch *are both morning papers, and print on Sunday morning. Calling there one day to look over the *Springfield Republican,* we asked the editor of the *Dispatch* in reference to not issuing a Monday paper. He at once replied that they rested on the Sabbath, and had conscientious scruples all through the South against Monday papers, because it compelled Sunday labor; while Sunday papers were made on Saturday.

In the North, Sunday papers are objected to principally because they are supposed to keep people away from church, though the more cautious keep this reason as much in the background as possible and are eloquent in their pleas for a rest day for the newsboys. They have nothing, however, to say against the Monday paper which is prepared almost wholly on Sun-day.
