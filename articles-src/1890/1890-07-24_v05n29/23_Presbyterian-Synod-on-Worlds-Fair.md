THE Reformed Presbyterian Synod has transmitted to Congress a memorial protesting against Sunday work on the Worlds Fair, and asking that the gates be closed on Sundays. The Synod seems to be very much at sea. The fair is not to be at Washington. Is it to be on the high seas? Or is it a traveling show subject to inter-state commerce regulations? It has been supposed, for some time, that the site had been fixed at Chicago, but evidently the Presbyterian Synod had not heard of it, for they are too intelligent men to ask Congress to interfere with the municipal government of the city of Chicago, and dictate the local management of any fair, whether it be County, State, or Worlds fair, held within its jurisdiction. Of course the Government can close its own exhibit on Sunday but there its jurisdiction ends.
