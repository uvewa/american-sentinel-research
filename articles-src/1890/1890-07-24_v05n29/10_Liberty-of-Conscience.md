# Liberty of Conscience.

R. M. KING, of Obion County, Tennessee, belongs to a sect which holds Saturday and not Sunday to be the Sabbath. He observes Saturday with great strictness, and on Sunday quietly proceeds with the labor on his farm.

For doing so, Mr. King was indicted, tried, convicted and fined last March. The National Religious Liberty Association—an organization composed entirely of believers in the Christian religion—has undertaken King’s defense, and the case has been appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States for the purpose of testing there the constitutionality of State laws enforcing the religious observance of Sunday as a Sabbath.

Whatever the judicial ruling may be as to the constitutional power of a State to enforce such laws, there can be no doubt that their enforcement in such cases as that of Mr. King is a gross violation of natural rights and rights of conscience. It is not contended that Mr. King disturbed any neighbor in the enjoyment of a quiet Sunday, but merely that his working on Sunday and his observance of Saturday as his Sabbath instead, was an offense to the moral sense of the community, and a violation of the law of the State.

If it was so, it is high time for the community in which Mr. King lives to discipline its moral sense, and for his State to rearrange its laws in conformity with that principle of individual liberty which lies at the foundation of American institutions.

The principle involved is simple and its application plain. The State has nothing to do with religion except to protect every citizen in his religious liberty. It has no more right to prescribe the religious observance of Sabbaths and holy days than to order sacraments and ordain creeds.

In recognition of the general custom of the people, the State rightfully makes Sunday a legal holiday, in order that no man whose conscience or convenience forbids may be compelled to work on that day. The law also properly protects citizens against unnecessary disturbance of their quietude on that day, but beyond that it has no right to go, in a country where Church and State are totally separated by fundamental law. To go further is for the State to assume powers inconsistent with its being and very dangerous to religious liberty.

And this doctrine is held by all enlightened men of all creeds, not in antagonism to any but in defense of all. It is the doctrine of perfect religious liberty in a purely secular State as opposed to the doctrine of State absolutism and intolerance in religion.—*Editorial in New York World, June 23.*

THE Rev. G. E. Gordon, whom many of our citizens met at the recent Dairymen’s Association, promulgates some sensible ideas. He recently signed a remonstrance against the enactment by Congress of laws to enforce the observance of the Sabbath. “I am opposed to all legislation of that kind,” he said, when questioned about it. “I believe that the people have the right of quiet assembly, and that meetings should be protected from both inside and outside disturbance. I am opposed to rowdy Sundays, and I am opposed to rowdy Mondays. I do not believe that a Catholic corner-stone laying procession, with its band has any more right to disturb a meeting of Turners, than a Sangerfest band has to disturb a church meeting. Legislation for the observance of Sunday, because it is Sunday, is not in harmony with American principles. After nineteen centuries of existence if the Church can not conquer the world without special legislation, it would better give it up. I think the freer the Church is from legislative enactments the more chance it has, the further it reaches, and the more good it does.”—*Columbus*,* Wisconsin, Democrat.*

SECTARIAN instruction should be sedulously excluded from the public schools of the land. The Catholics, as they have a right to do, object even to the reading of the Protestant Bible in such schools: but now comes Rev. Charles O. Brown, of Dubuque, in a letter to the Des Moines *Capital,* saying there are “at least seven district schools in Dubuque County where the Catholic catechism is taught.” A church so strenuous in preventing unwelcome reading in the presence of its children should not employ the public funds to promote their doctrines, nor expect that other people will be willing to have it done.—*The Lyons, Iowa, Mirror.*

SPEAKING of the Non-Partisan Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, the *Independent* of this city says: “We most heartily commend it to those who want to do temperance work without complication with political parties.” And so do we; and not only so, but we suggest that every Christian ought to want to do temperance work in just that way.

THE *Mail and Express* heads the following dispatch, “Americanism in the West”

> Chicago, June 13. One hundred delegates from lodges of the Patriotic Sons of America throughout the State met last evening at the Grand Pacific Hotel to devise means of creating a public sentiment in favor of the suppression of German public schools. The meeting was enthusiastic and unanimous.

Let us hear no more about Russian and German despotism in forcing the Russian and German languages upon conquered provinces.

A SPRINGFIELD, Ohio, dispatch says:—

> Canton and Springfield played the first Sunday game of ball, on Sunday, before 3,000 people, notwithstanding the ministers’ vigorous protest. Monday morning, by pre-arrangement of the baseball management, Constable Parsons arrested managers and players. In Squire Miller’s court they pleaded guilty, and each was fined twenty-five cents and costs. The latter will be thrown off. Church-going people are kicking over the fines imposed by the Justice, and there is likely to be some fun later.

That seems strange. We are confidently assured by very many people that Sunday laws are not religious, but police regulations for the health of the people. If that were true it. would seem that boards of health, and not the church people, should do the “kicking” when Sunday laws are violated.

JUNE 2, Joseph Keefer and Joseph Barnett, of Indianapolis, were fined by Mayor Sullivan for taking photographs on Sunday. The former, with costs, paid $19.50 and the latter paid $13.25. Both were amateurs engaged in taking landscapes. George Wilson and Ruth Keeter were arrested for the same offense, but their cases were continued. Laws that make such things possible ought to be promptly abolished. We suppose, however, that the Indiana Sunday law is simply a “civil regulation” to “preserve the health of the people” by keeping them from working too hard. It might not occur to many that amateur photography is necessarily either very hurtful physically or morally, but they forget that this was done on Sunday.

Sunday is a very peculiar day. It would no doubt be all right for the Mayor of Indianapolis to take his carriage and enjoy a drive on Sunday, or for any number of people to devote the day to feasting and visiting, but taking photographs of landscapes is not to be tolerated.

SENATOR BLAIR, in a letter to the *Mail and Express* some time since, said:—

> I yet believe that instead of selecting a final toleration of so-called religions, the American people will, by constant and irresistible pressure gradually expel from our geographical boundaries every religion except the Christian in its varied forms. I do not expect to see the pagan and other forms existing side by side with the former, both peaceably acquiesced in, for any length of time. I do not think that experience will satisfy the American people that the inculcation of any positive religious belief hostile to the Christian faith, or the practice of the forms of any other worship, is conducive to the good order of society and the general welfare. There may not be any exhibition of bigotry in this. I believe that religious toleration will yet come to be considered to be an intelligent discrimination between the true and the false, and the selection of the former by such universal consent as shall exclude by general reprobation the recognition and practice of the latter. . . . The people are considering these subjects anew. They are questioning whether there be not some mistake in theories of religious liberty, which permit the inculcation of the most destructive errors in the name of toleration, and the spread of pestilences under the name of liberty which despises the quarantine

This casts an important sidelight upon the legislation of which Mr. Blair is the author. It shows that the spirit of religious despotism and intolerance is ingrained in his very make-up, and that these measures in legislation are simply the means through which he would give vent to that which is in him and a host of others of his kind who are backing him up in his medieval methods.

SOME time ago when everything possible was being done to secure from Congress some recognition of Sunday as the Sabbath, some action that would serve as a precedent for more extended and far- reaching legislation, the country was assured that the District of Columbia was without a Sunday law. THE SENTINEL published at that time an old Sunday law of the State of Maryland which has long been in force in the District, having never been repealed, but, even after it was published, the statement was still bandied about that the District had no Sunday law. This is now contradicted by the following from the Washington correspondent of the *Mail and Express:—*

> There is a good deal of excitement in sporting circles here over the question of Sunday baseball games. The Sunday law in the District of Columbia is very strict. Not only are all saloons, cigar stores, and other shops closed, but the barber shops are shut up also, peddlers are not allowed to sell fruit on the street, and while newsboys are allowed to sell papers, they are not permitted to cry their wares. There is no city on the continent where Sunday observance is so strictly enforced, and no attempt has ever been made to resist or test the law.

> The baseball managers hold that the game is a healthy amusement, and that there is no law to prohibit them from doing as they please within the inclosure which is leased by them. The grounds are in an isolated locality, and they claim that no one can be disturbed or interfered with in their observance of the Sabbath, by a game. They claim also that there is no law prohibiting baseball playing on Sunday. The District Commissioners, however, say that there is a law against Sunday desecration and they intend to enforce it.
Those who remember reading the Sunday law of the District of Columbia, published in THE SENTINEL of February 13, will readily agree that it is “very strict”; also that it is ample to prevent ballplaying or almost anything else of a secular nature on Sunday.

A MOST interesting book has found its way to our table. It is entitled, “From Eden to Eden,” by the late J. H. Waggoner of Basel, Switzerland. This book is a brief examination of the more important historic and prophetic portions of the Scriptures. It is not a labored argument to prove the divine inspiration of the Bible. That is taken for granted. And yet the book presents incidentally the most irrefragable evidence of the divine origin of both the Old and New Testaments. The Scriptures themselves are their own best witness, and the author of this book well says:—

> It is the office of the Scriptures themselves to convince of their own origin and authority. To those who read them reverently not a word is needed to prove that they are divine; while to those who do not read them, or who read them carelessly and without reverence, no manner or amount of proof can be given that can cause them to realize their divinity, their importance, or their beauty. To be appreciated, the Bible must be studied with an earnest desire to learn the truth.

The object of this book is to assist to just such a study as is here indicated, and the plan upon which it is written is most admirably adapted to that end. One important truth kept constantly in view by the author is the unity of the divine plan as revealed in the several parts of the Scriptures.

Though embracing only 264 pages, this work covers “the entire period of the world’s history and the consummation of the plan of redemption, yet the important truths which enter into this plan are so connected in their presentation, that the thoughtful reader cannot fail to see the relation of each to the others, and to realize the necessity of each as a part of the whole—brevity being rather a help in this direction than otherwise.”
