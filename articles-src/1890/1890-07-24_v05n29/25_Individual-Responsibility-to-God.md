GOD having made every individual directly responsible to him for his attitude toward his Creator, and for his spiritual condition and character, and as there is no possible way in which the State can assume this responsibility, it follows that every individual must be left absolutely free in all things pertaining to man's duty toward God. This freedom is destroyed, or at least abridged, by even slight State interference in religious matters; therefore we oppose State recognition of any religion further than is absolutely necessary to protect all alike in the observance of religious services, and in the practice of religion.
