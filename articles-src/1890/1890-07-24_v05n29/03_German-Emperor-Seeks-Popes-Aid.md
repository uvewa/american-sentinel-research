THE German Emperor is reported as having "frankly admitted that governments cannot accomplish much unless organized Christianity comes to their aid." In view of this conclusion he writes an autograph letter to the Pope inviting his co-operation in the adjustment of social questions in the present crisis in continental labor agitation, etc. The correspondent who reports this declares, "There is no doubt that a great national movement is on foot, to give the Pope a leading part in an effort to deal with universal labor troubles. His holiness recognizes this as a great opportunity for the church to put itself at the head of the worldwide reform demanded by organized labor. He holds that the nation must adopt the principles of Christianity, and that the church is the only power competent to meet the issues involved in the social and industrial movement." How different is this from the "great national movement on foot" in this country? The two are born of the same mother; in fact they are twins.
