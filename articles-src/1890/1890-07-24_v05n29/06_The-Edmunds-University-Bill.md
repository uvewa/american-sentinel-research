## A Bill

To establish the University of the United States.

> *Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled*: That there shall be, and hereby is, established a corporation in the city of Washington to be known as the University of the United States.

> SECTION 2. That the corporation shall consist of and be governed by a Board of Regents, composed of the President of the United States, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of War, the Attorney-General, the Secretary of the Navy, the Postmaster-General, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Chief Justice of the United States, and twelve citizens of the United States, no two of whom shall be residents of the same State, who shall be appointed by a concurrent resolution of the two houses of Congress. Any vacancy occurring in the office of any regent appointed by the two houses of Congress shall be filled by a concurrent resolution of the two houses. The twelve citizens so appointed regents shall as soon as may be, after their appointment, be divided by the Board of Regents into three classes, of four each. The members of the first class shall hold office for three years, the members of the second class, so divided, shall hold office for six years, and the members of the third class, so divided, shall hold office for nine years; and when a new appointment is needful for the continuation of each of the classes, it shall be made for three years; and if a vacancy occur in any of the classes, it shall be filled by appointment for the remainder of the term only, in respect of which the vacancy exists.
> SEC. 3. That the said Board of Regents shall have a common seal and have perpetual succession, and be entitled to the rights and privileges of a public literary corporation. The University hereby established shall institute and carry on a course of education and research in all branches of learning and investigation that shall, in the opinion of the Board of Regents, from time to time, be most conducive to the advancement and to the increase and development of knowledge, and such as the usual course of education in the schools, colleges, and universities in the United States does not furnish the best means and facilities for doing. To the ends aforementioned the said Board of Regents may establish executive offices, and appoint officers of said corporation, and establish and support such professorships, fellowships, scholarships and courses of instruction, study and investigation, and research as shall to them seem meet; and to these ends they may, from time to time, make such rules, regulations, ordinances, and orders as to them shall seem meet, so that the same be consistent with the provisions of this act.
> SEC. 4. That the said Board of Regents shall hold their first meeting at Washington, in the District of Columbia, on such day as the President of the United States shall designate, on notice be given by him of the time and place of such meeting.
> SEC. 5. That the said Board of Regents shall in each year report to Congress a full and complete statement of its progress and operations, with an account of all moneys expended in the course of its operations.
> SEC. 6. That the said Board of Regents shall have, and are hereby granted, authority to obtain the necessary grounds and provide for the necessary buildings and conveniences required for the purposes of this act, and to fix the compensation and allowance of all officers, professors, fellows, and scholars authorized by this act to be by them provided for, and to provide for all incidental expenses arising from the execution of this act; all of which expenses shall be reported to the proper accounting officers of the Treasury and passed upon according to the usual course of accounts for the public service, but no such expense shall exceed the allowance in gross provided for in this act.
> SEC. 7. That the sum of not exceeding five hundred thousand dollars is hereby appropriated, for the expenses of the procurement of the necessary grounds and the erection of the necessary buildings contemplated in this act.
> SEC. 8. That the sum of five million dollars of money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, is hereby permanently set apart in the Treasury of the United States as the principal of a perpetual fund, the necessary part of the income of which, and no more than such income, may be annually used for the purposes in this act mentioned. The said sum so set apart shall bear interest at the rate of four per cent. per annum, out of which four per cent. per annum all the expenses of said University, except the expenses provided for in the special appropriation for the grounds and buildings herein before mentioned, shall be paid.
> SEC. 9. That the said Board of Regents may receive gifts and donations in aid of any of the objects in this act mentioned, and in such case they shall invest or otherwise deal with the same according to the will of the donor in each case.
> SEC. 10. That no special sectarian belief or doctrine shall be taught or promoted in said University, but this prohibition shall not be deemed to exclude the study and consideration of Christian theology.
> SEC. 11. That no person otherwise eligible according to the provisions of this act shall be excluded from the benefits thereof on account of race, color, citizenship, or religious belief.
> SEC. 12. That Congress shall have power at all times, according to its judgment for the public good, to amend or repeal this act, and it shall have the power by any committee of either house of Congress appointed for that purpose, to visit and inquire into, and report upon all the operations of the corporation established by this act.
