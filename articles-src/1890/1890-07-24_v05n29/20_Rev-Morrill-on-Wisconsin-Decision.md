REV. G. L. MORRILL, of Calvary Church, Minneapolis, Minnesota, preached a sermon not long since, criticising the decision of the Wisconsin Court on the Bible in the schools, in which he said:—

> Has a Scripture-loving and living conscience no right to be respected, especially when it is in the majority? Shall the right of way be given a few atheistic and ignorant brigands, and denied the many who regard the Bible as the basis of civil freedom, virtue, and intelligence? Is this the fifteenth, or nineteenth century? Do we live in America, or Russia?

Admitting the argument in the first two questions, then the accent of surprise in the last two is very appropriate.
