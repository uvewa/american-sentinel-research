THE religious education of the children of the State cannot be entrusted to the State. Why? Because the State has no religion, and cannot have. Were the State to get religion then we would have a State religion, and that would be un- American. If the State should join the Church then we would have a State Church, and that would not be republican. The State is entirely secular and cannot teach religion.—*Rev. T. D. Peake*.
