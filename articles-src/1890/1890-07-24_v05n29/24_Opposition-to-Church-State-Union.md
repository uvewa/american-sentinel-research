LET none suppose for a moment that our opposition to what its friends are pleased to call "religion and the State," springs from opposition to Christianity. We have a most profound regard for the Christian religion, and are doing all in our power for its promotion. And it is our regard for Christianity that leads us to oppose anything which either directly or indirectly tends to unite Church and State; because such unions instead of promoting pure religion have always and everywhere corrupted it; and instead of attracting people to the Church from a desire to lead blameless lives, and to attain to eternal life at last, have either driven them further from the Church, or else have attracted them to it for temporal advantage rather than for spiritual upbuilding and moral sanctification.
