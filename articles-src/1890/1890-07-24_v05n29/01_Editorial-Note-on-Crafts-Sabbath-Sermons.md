IN a letter to the *Rocky Mountain News*,* *Ellis Meredith says: "The Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts preached three times on Sunday last, at various churches in our city, each discourse being on the observance of the Sabbath. This trio of sermons brings irresistibly to mind, the saying of the old Scotch bishop, Lauderdale: 'It's awfu' wonderfu' tae me, hoo some folk tak' it upo' theirsel's tae explain things tae the Almighty.'"
