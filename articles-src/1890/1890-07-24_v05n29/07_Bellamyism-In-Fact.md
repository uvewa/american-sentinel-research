# Bellamyism In Fact.

THE following bill has been introduced in the United States Senate by Senator Plumb, of Kansas:—

> Be it enacted, that the President of the United States shall forthwith issue a call addressed to all citizens of this republic over twenty-one years of age, inviting them to serve in the grand army of labor of this republic for not less than one day, under the following terms and conditions; First, the hours of labor shall not exceed four hours per day for more than five days in each week, nor more than six successive weeks without an intermission of two weeks; second the rate of wages shall be four dollars per day, and be payable weekly, in the declaratory, full legal tender, silk-threaded, greenback, paper money of the United States of America exclusively.

> SECTION 2. That an Executive Department of Labor be and is hereby established, and the office of Secretary of the Department of Labor, at a salary of $4 per day, is hereby created, for the purpose of enabling the said President to rapidly commission and assign said volunteers to duty in the public service, where their abilities will reflect credit upon themselves; and it is hereby distinctly provided that the tenure of office in said service shall be held exclusively, at the pleasure of the said volunteer, and not, as heretofore, at the pleasure of some spoilsman who may happen to hold a commission issued by the President of the United States or other officer thereof.
> SECTION 3. That the money necessary to carry the provisions of this act into effect, be, and is hereby appropriated out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated, and in case there shall be no money in said treasury, then it shall be the duty of the Treasurer of the United States to inform the Secretary of the treasury of that fact, and he shall at once cause a sufficiency thereof to be prepared and covered into the Treasury for said purpose.
> SECTION 4. That all laws, and parts of laws, in conflict herewith, be, and are hereby repealed, and this act shall take effect when approved.
That is Bellamyism, otherwise called Nationalism, reduced to legal form. Of course so far as Senator Plumb is concerned this is only a “take off;” but as for Bellamyism it is the genuine article set in statutory phrase. Nothing more than this is expected to be done with the bill; but it is worth something to have Mr. Bellamy’s extravaganza reduced to a definite proposition and put into plain every-day English. We should like to see Mr. Bellamy or any who holds his fancy, either advocate or oppose it. [214]
