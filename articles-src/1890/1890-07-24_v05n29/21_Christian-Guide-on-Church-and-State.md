THE *Christian Guide*, a neat eight-page paper, published in Boston, by Rev. J. B. Daly, a converted priest, comes to us asking an exchange. We like the tone of the paper and welcome it to our table. In an article on "Church and State" the *Guide *says that "Bishop Doane, in an article on the school question, remarks that 'separate schools for Protestants and Romanists are allowed in England and Holland.' Well, that is a very good reason why we do not want separate schools in the United States. Separate schools would necessarily be religious; and the United States could not support such schools, for the most prominent feature of our Government is the separation of Church and State. Once let this Government support such schools, and we would then unite Church and State. That we cannot do and never shall do, to please the Church of Rome, or any other church."

The *Guide* well says, "or any other church," for the danger is quite as great from misguided Protestants as from Romanists. The demand for unsectarian religious instruction in the public schools is nothing more nor less than a demand for Protestant instruction; and the State has no more right to teach Protestantism than it has Romanism.
