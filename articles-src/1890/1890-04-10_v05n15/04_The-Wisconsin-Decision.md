# The Wisconsin Decision.

THE *Mail and Express of* this city has a good deal to say against the Wisconsin Supreme Court decision excluding the Bible from the public schools of that State, but it has not given any good reason why the Protestant version of the Scriptures should be read rather than the Catholic version, nor why the Christian Scriptures should have a place in schools supported by the State, to the exclusion of the sacred books of other religions. How would those who insist upon the reading of the Bible in the public schools enjoy living in a Mormon community, and have a Mormon schoolboard and a Mormon teacher make the reading of the “Book of Mormon” or the “Book of Doctrines and Covenants” a part of each day’s programme of school work? They would have just the same right to do it that Protestants have to compel the children of Catholic parents to listen to the reading of the Bible as translated by authority of King James.

But it will probably be said that the Protestant Scriptures ought to be read in the schools because they are the word of God. But that is only to say that the State has the right, not only to decide what is the word of God, but to require everybody to acquiesce in that decision. The position is utterly untenable, in the light of the history of the past. The State, being composed of individuals of many and varied beliefs, must of necessity leave religion and religious teaching entirely alone. A Christian majority has no more right to force the Bible upon the infidel minority than an infidel majority would have to force the “Age of Reason’’ upon a Christian minority. And we marvel that all Christians cannot see that in insisting upon the right of the State to give any kind of religious instruction whatever, they are placing themselves in a position where, were the majority to change, they would by their own course be estopped from denying the right of infidels, Mormons, or Romanists, to teach their religion in the schools where they have the necessary number of votes to sustain such a course. The man who concedes the right of the State to dictate to the individual in matters of religion, simply confesses that he is ready to surrender his conscientious convictions should the Government command him so to do.
