THE *Union Signal,* of February 13, makes several quotations from the first number of Mr. William T. Stead's *Review of Reviews,* published in London, England. Mr. Stead believes in a good time coming, when there will be a grand federation of English-speaking people, and also a United States of Europe. What hinders this now is this: "The religious side of politics has not yet entered the minds of men." And we say in truth, Woe be to the world when that time comes. This happy result is to be brought about, however, and Christianity is to show forth among the nations through the following:—

> Men and women must work for the salvation of the State with as much zeal and self-sacrifice as they now work for the salvation of the individual.

And how will they save the State? Will the State repent, confess its sins, make [115] reparation of all its unjust gains, believe, and be baptized? And when it is "saved," will it be taken to heaven? This salvation of the State, of which so much is said, is a deception. The duty of the Church and of Christians is to save men and women out from the world. While in the world, they are not to be of the world. Every step in the direction of religion in the State only carries that State so much nearer the Dark Ages, and places so much more power in the hands of that system—the Papacy—which knows so well how to use every advantage gained.—*Signs of the Times.*
