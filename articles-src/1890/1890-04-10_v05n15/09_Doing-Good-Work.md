# Doing Good Work.

THE International Tract Society, as agent for the distribution of the literature of the National Religious Liberty Association in the territory covered by the Society, is doing a great work. The president writes: “There is no limit to what the Society might accomplish; the only hindrance being the lack of money necessary to pay for the literature that we find so many excellent openings for.” He has appealed to his Society, to increase its membership, and donate means for this purpose.

A secretary has been appointed to have especial charge of this department. The different offices report thousands of pages of matter sent out weekly.

The publications issued by the National Religious Liberty Association, are such as all patriotic, thinking citizens should read and ponder.
