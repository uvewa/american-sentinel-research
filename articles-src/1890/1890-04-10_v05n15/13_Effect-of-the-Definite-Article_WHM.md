IN the last paragraph of the Blair Sunday-rest bill, occurs this phrase, "individuals who conscientiously believe in and observe any other day than Sunday, as *the* Sabbath." In this connection, the definite effect of the article "the" cannot be ignored. It is not as *a* Sunday, or as *a* civil Sunday, or as *a* rest day, or as *a *Sabbath, but as "the" Sabbath. What Sabbath? When definitely stated, like this, the authority to which final appeal must be taken, is the commandment of God, and that says "*The seventh* day is *the* Sabbath of the Lord thy God."

This expression in the bill therefore definitely proves that the day in regard to which this legislation is asked is not a civil Sunday, but "the Sabbath of the Lord." When all knowledge of the growth, derivation and construction of the English language has been lost, then the Sunday legislationists may hope to convince intelligent men that the words "the Sabbath" are susceptible of the translation "a civil Sunday,"—not before.
