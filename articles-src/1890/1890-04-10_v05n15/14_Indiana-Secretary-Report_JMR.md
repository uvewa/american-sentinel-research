STATE SECRETARY J. M. REES, of Indiana, says: "I find that the people are more anxious to hear, on the subject of Religious Liberty, than they were one year ago. Many who were opposed to our work at that time, are now in favor of it. Last Sunday night, after speaking to a crowded house, I presented the petition for those who desired to sign. Among others who signed it, were three persons who had signed a petition in favor of the Blair bill. They were very anxious to sign my petition, and did so, saying that they were blinded when they signed the other. So, you see, when the subject is set before the people, they will realize the unreasonableness of religious legislation."
