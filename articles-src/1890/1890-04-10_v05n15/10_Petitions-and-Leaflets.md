# Petitions and Leaflets.

BLANK petitions against religious legislation are now published in two sizes. The smaller size, is intended more especially for the use of lecturers, and is ruled for four signatures.

The larger blank is prepared in the English, French, Swedish, German, and Dutch language.

The leaflet intended to be used in the solicitation of signatures, is entitled, “My reasons for signing the petition against religious legislation,” and contains sixteen cogent reasons for so doing, expressed in plain and simple language. This is furnished free to workers. All should have it, and so use it, that every signer can have no possible excuse for not knowing fully what he is signing, and why he signs. It should not be forgotten, for a moment, that the object of this canvass, is not so much to gather the largest number of signatures possible as to bring to the minds of the people, a knowledge of the course of religious legislation which is being attempted, and arouse them to a study of the principles involved. Those truths which are at the foundation of Christianity pure and undefiled, are at stake in this question. They who canvass intelligently for signatures to these petitions, are teaching the alphabet of true religion. It is only by the acquirement of this alphabet, that it becomes possible to read the word of God understandingly, in its application to the events of this age, and comprehend the philosophy of history, in its true relation to the gospel. The one who rises to the opportunity which the Religious Liberty Association offers, of preaching the word of truth, in a language which all men *must* understand, and making a practical application of its principles to the rules of the civil policy, which are to govern their daily life and actions, will be he who realizes most fully, that “the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom;” and, being well grounded in that, “then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment and equity, yea, every good path.” W. H. M.
