THE American Sabbath Union, an ecclesiastical-political organization, has taken upon itself to make the city of Washington, or rather the District of Columbia, happy by the adoption of a rigid Sunday law. A member of Congress, Mr. Breckinridge, from the State of Kentucky, has brought in a bill in which it is expressly said that it shall be illegal for all people to do any secular labor or business on Sunday. Only those persons are excepted who conscientiously, and from religious conviction, keep another than the first day of the week. The title of the bill is "A bill to prevent persons being forced to labor on Sunday."

The movement is not altogether new; a bill was brought before the last Congress, but it was strongly attacked by Seventh-day Adventists and Baptists, and therefore this second bill with the exemption clause, which is intended to satisfy the opponents, was brought in.

All Sunday laws, as they have been enacted so far in twenty-eight States of our Union, rest on the principle of legal religious views; but if a State, through its representatives in legislation, lays down such measures, it concerns the State only, while in case of legislation of Congress such measure does not only extend over the District of Columbia, but, as a national law, concerns all Territories, and must be acknowledged as a legal measure there. For this reason the Prohibitionists have tried to have a law passed by Congress which prohibits the manufacture and sale of all liquor, because they knew that by this the same law would become binding in the Territories of the country.

A few weeks ago, a convention of the American Sabbath Union was held here, to induce the public to sign the petition to Congress, and make general propaganda for their movement. The sessions were held in a Methodist Church; the management was in the hands of ministers. Every session was opened by prayer and Scripture reading, and closed with a benediction by one of the ministers. The delegates of the General Synod—Dr. Butler, from Washington, and Rev. Sylvanus Stall, from Baltimore—were appointed as speakers to work for the cause. So the Lutheran Church did not fail to send representatives, in this legalistic-ecclesiastic-political movement for a Sunday law. Without regard to the deception which is on the face of it, if we compare the title with the wording of the bill, an Evangelical Lutheran Christian cannot lend his hand to such a mixing of secular and spiritual power.

I, as representative of the General Council, attended the first evening session of that convention, that I might hear what should be brought up. And I must say that what was said in favor of the consecration of Sunday was right and good, if they would only rest satisfied with such instruction and admonition; but the main purpose was this: to carry the bill, and induce the legislative body in the capitol to pass it; that is, the Church, through its representatives, demands a law from the secular Government which shall bind the conscience; and therein a blind man must see a union of Church and State. As I spoke to Rev. Crafts, the secretary of the Sabbath Union, after the close of the session, and gave him my reasons why I could not join such a movement, and also requested time to express my reasons publicly in the convention, that the other side might be heard there, this gentleman, who who had himself invited me, gave me the following answer: "You are the first Evangelical Lutheran minister whom I have met who is against us." I expressed my regret. He pointed to Butler and Stall, who belonged to the Lutheran Church. Further, this gentleman remarked: "This is no debating club; we cannot let our opponents come in here, that is, Jews, Infidels, Seventh-day Adventists, and Baptists." Whereupon I answered that I belonged to none of these classes of people. "Well," he concluded, "you are entitled to your opinion, for this is a free country." "Just for this reason, Mr. Crafts," I answered, "I was convinced that to me, being a minister, the opportunity would be given to express myself; but I find that the liberty of this country is usurped by your Sabbath association."

One thing I was glad to see in this gentleman. He confessed to believing in the Galesburg rule, in the following words: "You would not allow me to preach from your pulpit?" Whereupon I answered emphatically, "No, sir; certainly not." "Well, I do not allow you to defend your doctrine from my pulpit." But in this way these gentlemen strike themselves in the face. They speak loudly about it,— that it is no religious movement, and represents no ecclesiastical principles,—and yet they make that a rule which belongs in the realm of ecclesiastical doctrine and spiritual life only.

I hope that the members of this Congress will have more sound common sense than to pass such a law, which sails under false colors, and lay down a legal measure which is fully and entirely against the liberty of conscience secured in this country. Ministers who work for such laws testify most strongly to their poverty; in fact, such say thereby, The Gospel has lost its power; help us through the secular law.J. MULLER.
