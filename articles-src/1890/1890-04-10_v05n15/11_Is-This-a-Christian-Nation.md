# Is This a Christian Nation?

IN a Sunday lecture delivered in Philadelphia, March 2, Rabbi Joseph Krauskopf gives a forcible and logical reply to the question, “Is this a Christian Nation?” He cites the rapid increase of a heterogeneous population as varied in religious belief or unbelief, as in nationality,—the millions of those who do not believe in Christianity at all, unbelievers, Agnostics, ethical culturists, free religionists, Jews, Mohammedans, Confucianists, Buddhists, etc.,—and shows that their presence precludes the possibility of this being either technically or theoretically a Christian Nation, in the National Reform sense of the expression.

In opening his discourse the Rabbi speaks as follows: “In view of the strenuous efforts now being made by some religious organizations, to secure the passage by Congress, of the three religious measures now before it—the Blair Sunday bill, the Breckinridge Sunday bill for the District of Columbia, and the Blair Educational amendment, which provides for the teaching of the principles of Christianity in the public schools—the National Religious Liberty Association, an organization effected to oppose all religious legislation by the civil Government, is exerting its utmost to effect the defeat of these bills. To attain this end, it enlists the support of every liberal preacher, and speaker, and editor. It is represented at Washington by men whose duty it is to oppose the three religious measures now before Congress. It gathers signatures in nearly every State and Territory in the Union, to a petition to the Senate and to the House of Representatives ‘Not to pass any bill in regard to the observance of the Sabbath or Lord’s day, or any other religious or ecclesiastical institution of right,’ etc. By means of such systematic and energetic opposition, the friends of liberty of conscience were enabled to defeat, last year, what was commonly known as the Blair Sunday-rest bill, and the Blair amendment of the Constitution of the United States respecting establishments of religion and free schools, which were, excepting a few slight modifications, the same bills that Senator Blair has again introduced this year.

“Not content with last year’s defeat the Senator from New Hampshire is again exerting his utmost, with the aid of hundreds of preachers, and millions of signatures, to foist a Puritanic Sabbath upon the people of the United States, a Sunday law that shall make labor, amusement, the collection and transmission of mail, railway trafic on the ‘Lord’s day ’ punishable as crime, and an amendment to the constitution of the United States, which shall make the teaching of the ‘fundamental and non-sectarian principles of Christianity’ obligatory in every free public school. To enable the friends of Conscience to achieve another victory, and again to protect the Constitution of the United States from dangerous tamperings, aid is solicited.” . . . “I believe that it is high time that every American should understand fully, that here in our country, Church and State are totally separated, that this separation is ineradically engraven upon our Constitution, is interwoven with every fibre of every American freeman, and that, whoever attempts to form, by means of legislation, a link between them, aims at extinguishing the brightest star in the diadem of our glory, he is a traitor to his country, an enemy to his fellow citizens, a violater of the most sacred and the most cherished of all our possessions.”

He arraigns the Blair measures before Congress and says: “We know the subterfuge to which the Honorable Mr. Blair has resorted, this year. Last year’s bill demanded the teaching of the ‘ principles of the Christian religion’ in the public schools. In this year’s bill, he has somewhat altered the phraseology: he demands the teaching ‘ of the fundamental and non-sectarian principles of Christianity.’ The alteration is an ingenious blind, but as illogical as ingenious. ‘Fundamental non-sectarian principles of Christianity,’ are contradictory terms. The fundamental principles of Christianity, must necessarily involve the divinity of Christ, and this involves a mass of specifically Christian beliefs and doctrines.”

The address closes with this paragraph: “I am glad that a National Religious Liberty Association has been organized, [111] and that it is preparing for an active opposition. Let us give them whatever aid we can. Let us gather all the signatures we can for their petition to Congress. Let us show that we can oppose the Church and yet be friends of education and religion. Let us show that we can be loyal to the Constitution, without being hostile to the Bible; that we can separate the two, without making either the one or the other the loser by the severance. Let us insist upon our religious liberties. Let us insist that ecclesiastical property shall not be exempt from just taxation; that chaplains shall not be employed by the Government; that neither the President of the United States, nor the Governors of the various States shall appoint religious festivals or fasts; that Puritanic Sabbath laws shall be repealed; that the Bible shall be excluded from the public schools; that no exclusive privilege shall be conceded, in any department of the National or State Government to Christianity or any other special religion; that this is not a Christian Government, nor a Government of any other denomination, but a ‘Government of *all *the people, and for *all* the people, and by *all* the people.’” W. H. M.

STATE SECRETARY E. T. RUSSELL, of Ohio, writes that he has met with a most favorable reception in his lecturing, throughout the State. He finds villages and medium-sized towns to be the most satisfactory fields of labor. It is his custom to give three lectures in a place, and he frequently finds those who assist him materially in the circulation of the petition, and in other ways.

THE editor of a prominent paper in a western city writes: “Having read, in this week’s issue of the AMERICAN SENTINEL, the Declaration of Principles and objects of your Association, I am in hearty sympathy with them. . ... The advocates of the different forms of religious legislation are many, and prompt and effective work should be done to educate as to the true scope of civil government, and the duty and the right of the individual to worship according to the dictates of his conscience. I wish your Association Godspeed in its worthy work.” [112]

THE day following the defeat of his Educational bill, Senator Blair moved a reconsideration. His motion was promptly tabled. The next day Mr. Blair re-introduced the bill, and it is again on the calendar as a portentious piece of unfinished business for next year.

IN a recent article in the *Christian Nation,* Rev. J. M. Foster gives a new version of the fable of the goose which laid the golden egg. He says: “To take the Sabbath for popular temperance meetings is killing the hen which lays the golden egg, .as the foolish woman did in the fable story.” We presume that he must have read the “fable story” of this remarkable h*en* and of the foolish woman, in the same book out of which Dr. Stacy obtained his information regarding the “bounding kangaroo,” which he described as “springing from his lair” and drawing the life-blood from his victim.

THE statement is made in the *Pearl of Days* of March 21, that a man has just been fined twenty dollars in Washington City for violation of the Sunday law. How does this correspond with the statement so confidently made only a few weeks since by the friends of the Breckinridge Sunday bill that the District of Columbia had no Sunday law? As was plainly shown in the SENTINEL recently, the District has a very rigid Sunday law, and the purpose of the Breckinridge bill is not to supply such a law where none now exists but to get Congress to take the first step in religious legislation.

A CONFERENCE is called to meet in Dayton, Ohio, May 21, 22. The call is to those “who sincerely desire a real and visible union of all true followers of Christ;” and the object is to express “the growing conviction that the existing divisions into sects and denominations is contrary to the spirit and letter of the Gospel, the primitive order of the Church, and the prayer of Christ himself, and is a great hindrance to the world’s conversion.” The union here desired can never be effected by conventions, conferences, or comparisons of errors. It can be accomplished only by the genuine influence of the Spirit of Christ calling together those that are his. And when it is done the world will not be converted. “The world’s conversion” is a will-o’-the-wisp that deludes most of the churches and distracts them from the real sober work of God, to the mechanism of conventions, legislative enactments, and constitutional amendments. This world will never be converted.

A GENTLEMAN wishes space in this paper to prove that Jehovah, the God of the Jews, is not the same Being whom Jesus worshiped. We know that such a proposition cannot be maintained from the Scriptures; and as we recognize no other authority on such questions we cannot consent that our columns shall be used in any such way. The Bible, by which we mean the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, reveals but one God, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, and “the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.” To attempt to make it teach anything else would be worse than useless.

SENATOR BLAIR feels considerably put out about the failure of his Educational bill. He blames the Republican party for its defeat, and therefore serves the following notice:—

> I place it on record that there is an end of its political supremacy in this country, and there ought to be. I owe no allegiance to a party that lies in its platform to a Nation, and which chooses to go now and henceforth to its doom as a falsifier.

We do not know whether the Republican party is thus responsible or not; but accepting it as true, the defeat of that bill was one of the most meritorious acts that a party ever performed. It is to the honor of every senator who voted against it that he did so vote; and it may be spoken to his honor by his children and his children’s children.

SECRETARY CRAFTS, of the American Sabbath Union, so-called, is about to start upon another transcontinental lecture tour in the interests of compulsory Sunday observance. The dates are not positively fixed, but are proposed as follows:—

> April 6, Annapolis or Frederick, Md.; April 7, Hagerstown or Cumberland, Md.; April 8, Parkersburgh, W. Va.; April 9, Portsmouth, or some other city in southern Ohio; April 10, Evansville, or some other town in southern Indiana; April 11, Cairo, or some city in southern Illinois; April 13-16, Arkansas, (Little Rock, Fort Smith, etc.); April 17, Vinita, Ind. Ter.; April 18, Carthage, Mo., or Parsons, Kan.; April 20, 21, two of the following Kansas cities—Lawrence, Leavenworth, Atchison, Topeka, Emporia; April 22, Salina, Kan.; April 23, Newton or Winfield, or Arkansas City or Anthony, all in Kan.; April 24, Hutchinson or Great Bend, both in Kan.; April 25, Trinidad or La Junta, both Col.; April 27, Los Vegas, N. M.; April 28, Santa Fe, N. M.; April 29, Albuqurque, N. M.; Los Angeles, Cal. The return from California will be in June, through Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Nebraska, Iowa, the two Dakotas, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and northern Ohio.

We will as soon as possible publish the definite appointments.

THE Houston *Post* asks: “When will these good Sabbatarians learn that in attacking the Sunday paper they are barking up the wrong tree; that it is the Monday paper which [it is supposed] collides with the decalogue?” And the Galveston *News* responds: “Just as soon as they discover that it is the Monday paper which causes people to stay at home and read all day instead of going to Church.” This answer is undoubtedly the truth, for it has more than once been publicly stated in Sunday-law meetings and conventions that the greatest evil of the Sunday paper is not the work which it causes to be done upon that day, but the fact that it keeps people away from church and destroys their interest in spiritual things. This may be true, but it does not follow that the State ought to abolish the Sunday paper any more than it should abolish infidel papers and prohibit all men from speaking against the religion of the majority.

WE have received from the author, Mr. Francis Hope, London, England, a copy of “Bible Principles and the Union of Church and State.” The book contains one hundred and thirty pages, bound in flexible covers, is very neat and attractive in appearance and sells for one shilling (twenty-five cents). It is devoted to a discussion of the relation which should exist between Church and State, and is an excellent book. The work contains eight chapters, as follows:—

> Introduction, The Religion of Jesus, The Powers that Be, The Theocracy of Israel, The State in Particular, A Practical Test, A Brief Notice of The History of the Union Theory, and The Union in England.

We trust the book will have a large sale, for it ought to be read by everybody.

THE latest number of the *Sentinel Library* which has reached our table is “Arguments on the Breckinridge Sunday bill. The Object and Price of Exemption Clauses.” This number which is just out is one of the most valuable yet issued, and should have a prompt and extensive circulation. It gives the arguments presented to the Committee on the District of Columbia against the Breckinridge Sunday-rest bill at the hearing had February * 18. It should be read by everybody. Price, ten cents. The usual discount given to the trade and for large orders. It will be sent to any address, post-paid, upon receipt of price. Orders may be addressed to Pacific Press, Oakland, California, or to the same house at 43 Bond Street, New York. [113]
