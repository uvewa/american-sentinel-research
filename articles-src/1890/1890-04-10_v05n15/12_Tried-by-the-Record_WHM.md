THE *Congressional Record* for March 7, contains the following:—

> *Mr. Blair:* I present the petition of Mary E. Catlin, superintendent of the department of Sabbath observance, Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and secretary for the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, in which she states that on the night of February 17, 1890, petitions were stolen representing petitioners for a Sunday-rest law for the District of Columbia, and for all under the jurisdiction of Congress, from the various States to the number of 7,000 individual signatures, and she asks that this be accepted in place of the petitions, and printed in the *Record.*

> *The President, pro tempore:* The petition will be received and referred to the Committee on the District of Columbia.
In the same number of the *Record,* under the proceedings of the House, occurs this paragraph:—

> *By Mr. Breckinridge of Kentucky:* Petitions of 7,000 citizens for the Sunday-rest bill, to the Committee on the District of Columbia.

The following is a copy of the document referred to the House committee, and which represents the signatures in question:—

> Memorial to the United States House of Representatives. As petition secretary for the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, the undersigned, by this memorial, wishes to say that on the night of February 17, petitions were stolen from her house, representing petitions for a Sunday-rest law for the District of Columbia, and for all under the jurisdiction of Congress from the various States to the number of 7,000 (and more), nearly all individual signatures in duplicate.

We ask that this memorial be accepted in place of the petition, and printed in the *Record.*

> MARY E. CATLIN.

> *Petition Secretary, Superintendent of the Department of Sabbath Observance, of the W. C. T. U., of the District of Columbia.*
This is the sequel to the episode of the stolen petitions. When reading her address to the committee on the District of Columbia, at the hearing upon the local Sunday bill for the District, Mrs. Catlin said:—

> Honored Sirs, we ask that these rolls of petitions shall be to you, the voice of the people, urging you for a Sunday-rest law. I wish I could truly say the next sentence: we bring this morning such a plea, in the form of 27,131 endorsements for the Senate, and a larger number (30,000) for the House. But, last night, when I wrote this paper, I had that number to bring here this morning. When I went after them, I found that they had been stolen during the night, so that I am sorry to say, I have not that number to bring before you this morning.

Later in the hearing, the question was asked Mrs. Catlin, in regard to the petitions: "Were they signatures or endorsements?"

*Mrs. Catlin:* They were largely signatures.

*The Chairman:* How many of these signatures are you willing to say, came from the District of Columbia?

*Mrs. Catlin:* They were not from the District alone.

*The Chairman:* They were not from the District alone, but from the whole country?

*Mrs. Catlin:* Yes, sir.

The discrepancy between the numbers, 27,131 to the Senate, and 30,000 to the House, mentioned in the address to the committee, and the "7,000 (and more)" mentioned in the memorial, is remarkable. The peculiar indefiniteness of statement, as regards the whole matter is also noticeable. It will be seen that in her address, which she says was written the night before, when the petitions were in her possessions, she has numbered them with accuracy, as respectively 27,131, and 30,000, and characterized them as "endorsements." But, when questioned with a view to finding out the number of individual signatures, she replies, "They were largely signatures." This would naturally be understood to mean from 15,000 to 20,000. When asked, "How many of them were from the District," as bearing directly upon the local bill under consideration, the answer given is evasive —"They were not from the District alone."

The memorial, however, speaks of no signatures at all from the District, in reference to the District bill, but enumerates them as "from the various States." The number has dwindled to " 7,000 (and more);" and of these, the best that can be said, is not that they are individual signatures, but that "they are nearly all individual signatures." If the "nearly" bears the same relation to the 7,000 that the "largely" did to the 30,000, the list of individual signatures is quite small.

It will be seen also, that neither Mr. Blair, in his presentation to the Senate, nor Mr. Breckinridge in the House, nor Mrs. Catlin, either in her memorial or in her address to the committee (although questioned upon it) anywhere make mention of any of these signatures, as distinctively from the District of Columbia, praying for the passage of the local law. It is evident there were none; or, if any, so few that it was deemed best to ignore the voice of the District entirely, upon the passage of its own law.

It is to be noticed, also, that the presentations of the matter, both in the Senate and the House, as spread upon the record, are inaccurate. The memorial to the Senate is stated in the *Record,* as requesting the acceptance of 7,000 individual signatures, while the memorial itself says that there are "nearly" that, but leaves the actual number entirely indefinite. In the House, "petitions of 7,000 citizens for the Sunday-rest bill," are recorded as presented, without qualification, or suggestion that they were not offered in reality, but represented by a memorial.

The impenetrable indefiniteness and bewildering inaccuracy which has characterized every statement as regards these petitions, is characteristic, and no less true in the case of all the ostensible millions which have been presented. The value of these petitions for "Sunday rest" would be totally invalidated if only their character were generally understood. W. H. M.
