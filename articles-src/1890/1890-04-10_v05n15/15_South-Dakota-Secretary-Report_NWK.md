STATE SECRETARY N. W. KAUBLE writes from South Dakota: "Thus far I have spent my time in Dakota, in holding general meetings for the discussion of the principles of civil and religious liberty, and in lecturing. I have had, in the towns, good sized, intelligent audiences, and am highly gratified at the results." [119-120]
