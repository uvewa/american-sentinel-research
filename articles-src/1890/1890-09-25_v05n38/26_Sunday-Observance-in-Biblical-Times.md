THE *World* publishes an interview with a clergyman, whose name it does not give, and prefaces it with this explanation:—

> He said, at the outset, that his only object was to correct some popular errors as to the observance of Sunday in Biblical times, and to show exactly how the matter was then regarded.

Then follows an account of Christ's doings upon the Sabbath, and even Nehemiah's words concerning the Sabbath, (Neh. 8:10), are quoted to show how Sunday was observed in Bible times. It would be just as appropriate to quote Herodotus, to show how the Egyptians celebrated the Fourth of July. It actually seems that even a great many newspaper men don't know that Sunday is not the day called "the Sabbath" in the Scriptures.
