THE *Christian Statesman*, of the 4th inst., has quite a lengthy criticism of Senator Blackburn's eulogy upon the late Senator Beck, because in making that eulogy Senator Blackburn uttered sentiments which are not, in the opinion of the *Statesman*, in harmony with the teaching of the Christian religion. The *Statesman* does not question the right of Senator Blackburn to hold whatever religious views that may seem to him good, but it challenges his right to air them as a representative of a "people who are overwhelmingly Christian." And yet this is just the authority that the National Reformers are proposing to give to Congress and to the courts. They propose to recognize Christianity as the religion of this Nation, and then in their own words they must either have a standard of Christianity or else admit anything which claims to be Christianity. But who will make this standard of religion? Evidently just such men as Senator Blackburn, a man who, though an honest man as the world goes, and an able legislator, knows little more of what Christianity really is, than a Hottentot does of calculus. The *Statesman* ought not to object to a little of its own medicine, as a foretaste of what may be in the future.
