CHRISTIANITY and Churchism are two very different things. Christianity is a scheme of virtue and benevolence for the elevation of mankind. Churchism is a scheme of churchmen for power, plunder, and persecution. Our fathers utterly repudiated Churchism, refusing it either power or money; but said nothing of religion proper. The Churches of Rome, Russia, England, Turkey, and Mormondom are as far from Christ as day from night. In the United States is the only true Church with power to persuade; but none to tax, persecute, curse, or injure. Our fathers placed it just where it should be.—*Political Record, San Francisco, Cal*.
