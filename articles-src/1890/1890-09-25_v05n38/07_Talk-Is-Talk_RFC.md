THE following quotation from the Buffalo *Christian Advocate*, of May 15, 1890, is credited to Rev. Dr. Thomas Dixon, a Baptist minister, of New York:—

> This Nation was founded on the Decalogue and the ten commandments. The men who landed at Plymouth Rock, landed on their knees. The foundations of this Republic were cut from the quarry of God's eternal granite. Its foundation stones were laid in cement made with the tears and blood of Christian men and women. The man who has outgrown the Decalogue and the Golden Rule, has outgrown his usefulness in this Nation.

This has the true National Reform ring. The argument is, This Nation has been a Christian nation from the beginning; therefore our Constitution must be revised so as to permit legislation on the Decalogue *and* the ten commandments and the Golden Rule, in order to *make* this a Christian Nation. The tears and blood of Christian men and women, with which he says the foundation of our Nation was cemented, most naturally call to mind the persecutions of Baptists, Quakers, and others, before the formation of our peerless Constitution, the recurrence of which it was wisely designed to prevent. When men undertake to legislate for God and enforce his law, tears and blood flow as the result. To say a man has "outgrown his usefulness in this Nation," implies a desire for his banishment. Bigotry and intolerance go hand in hand. R. F. COTTRELL.
