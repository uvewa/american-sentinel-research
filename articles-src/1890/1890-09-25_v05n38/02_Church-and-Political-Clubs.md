HE who seeks to transform the church of God into a political club-room, must ever be regarded as the enemy of our higher ideals of civil and religious liberty, and also guilty of a Pharisaism which has the effrontery to dictate methods to God himself. This paper believes that the race will be happiest when it takes God's laws as they are, and enacts such laws for the regulation of human affairs as wisdom, tempered with justice, suggests.—*Central City*,* Nebraska, Republican*.
