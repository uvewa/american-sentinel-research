# National Religious Liberty Association.

## Declaration Of Principles.

> We believe in the religion taught by Jesus Christ.

> We believe in temperance, and regard the liquor traffic as a curse to society.
> We believe in supporting the civil government, and submitting to its authority.
> We deny the right of any civil government to legislate on religious questions.
> We believe it is the right, and should be the privilege, of every man to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience.
> We also believe it to be our duty to use every lawful and honorable means to prevent religious legislation by the civil government; that we and our fellow-citizens may enjoy the inestimable blessings of both religious and civil liberty.
C. ELDREDGE,*President.*

W. H. MCKEE,*Secretary.*

“THE American Sabbath Union,” says the *Pearl of Days,* “has presented an earnest appeal to the Commissioners of the World’s Columbian Exposition to be held in Chicago, asking them to decide that the Exposition shall be closed on Sundays. It is understood that the Commissioners will meet in Chicago, on October 7. The officers of the Union, in making this appeal, ask the co-operation of all the friends of the Sabbath throughout the land.”

ON a recent Sunday, a party of young men, of the city of Washington, were playing ball outside of hearing distance from any dwelling, but were arrested by the police, on the strength of the commonlaw decision, recently issued by the Commissioners, that ball-playing on Sunday is contrary to the Christian religion, and that the Christian religion is a part of the common law, and, consequently, of the law of the District of Columbia.

When the case was brought to trial, the Court and prosecuting attorney ignored the legal lore of the Commissioners, and tried the case under an ordinance prohibiting the playing of ball in streets, avenues, and alleys. The counsel for the ball players argued that the law had not been violated, although he attempted to placate the Court by acknowledging that the young men might better have been in church.

The policeman *thought* that they were playing on a line with the extension of Seventeenth street; the Judge therefore held that they were playing in the streets, and imposed a fine of five dollars.

Such things as ’these are sufficient evidence that wherever the authorities are infected with National Reform doctrines, religious regulations will be enforced, even outside of the law. What then will be the condition of affairs when all the religious legislation asked for has been secured?

THE advice of the Sunday Union in respect to the establishment of Law and Order Leagues throughout the country, for the enforcement of Sunday laws, has taken root, and in several localities has already reached the fruit-bearing period. A prominent instance, which the daily press is now noticing, occurs in Wheeling, West Virginia, where the League has undertaken to enforce the Sunday laws to the letter. A “special” says that on Sunday, August 31, it was impossible to purchase anything in Wheeling, other than necessary medicines, and mentions it as the intention of the League to stop the publication of the Sunday papers.

The dispatch declares, however, that “owing to the absurdly extreme measures taken, there has been a revulsion of feeling throughout the city.”

It is noticeable that the press comments do not take exception to the principle involved, but only criticise the action taken by the League as extreme and beyond what public opinion will uphold.

These organizations will continue to push the enforcement of religious laws and city ordinances to the farthest limit in which they can secure the application of the penalties attached, until at last, and not far in the future, this country will find itself under the rule of a religgious oligarchy. The Religious Liberty Association was organized none too soon.

THE Czar of Russia, who is the head of the Greek Church, demands that the Pope shall address him as an equal, which the Pope refuses to do. A Western paper thinks that the Pope has the better claim to pre-eminence, since he is the bigger humbug. But to us this seems like “snap judgment,” for since each, being but a man, claims to be the head of “the only true church,” how can the claim of one be any more preposterous than that of the other?

“EVERY Sunday,” says the *World, *“which finds thousands of people in our large cities without means of lawful and innocent recreation and refreshment, deepens the popular determination to make our laws conform to the conditions and customs of a cosmopolitan population.” The determination ought to be to make our laws conform to justice, and to the natural rights of the citizen. This they can never do as long as they are used to enforce the observance of any religious institution whatever.

THE *Dial*, of Oakland, California, makes the following excellent point on Mrs. Bateham, of Ohio, who is assisting in the California Sunday campaign:—

> Mrs. Bateham illuminated her speech at the Presbyterian church, Thursday night, by saying that the people of Washington awoke after twenty years, and found that they had no Sabbath law. Dear Mrs Bateham, Sister Bateham, do you not know that you have proved too much? See! *Without any law* the sleepy and highly religious people of old Washington observed the Sabbath well—so well as to stand in the front rank of all Sunday observing cities. If this was the result of having *no Sabbath* laws, why do you complain?

Friend *Dial*, you must not expect Mrs. Bateham to be consistent; but you can depend upon an Oakland audience to appreciate the dilemma in which she has placed herself and the cause which she represents.

MR. JOHN N. STEARNS, Corresponding Secretary of the National Temperance Society, has transmitted to the American Sabbath Union the following resolution, adopted at a regular meeting of the Board of Managers of the Society:—

> *Resolved*, That the Board of Managers of the National Temperance Society, in behalf of its membership throughout the Nation, earnestly protests against the opening of the World’s Fair on the Sabbath day.

This strikes us as being a little out of the line of the legitimate business of the National Temperance Society. If the managers want to throw their influence in favor of Sunday closing of the Exposition, they should do it on their own responsibility; they have, no right to commit the Society upon such a question.

JOSIAH STRONG, Secretary of the Evangelical Alliance, says:—

> All laws may be said to limit individual liberty, but just laws restrain each in the interest of all; they draw the circumscribing line only where the liberty of one overlaps that of many. Hence, law in a much larger sense, is the guardian of liberty. This is true of our Sabbath laws. Whatever can be said against them, as infringing personal liberty, may be urged with greater force against our common school laws; they rest on the same foundation and are alike pillars of our free institutions.

Is it a sound conclusion that, “this is true of our Sabbath laws,” and that “our common school laws rest upon the same foundation”? By school laws, of course, he means those which require attendance upon school for a stated period. Are laws enforcing compulsory attendance upon school, and laws enforcing compulsory observance of Sunday, parallel? They are not. Why not? Because common school education is a secular matter entirely, between the State and the parent and pupil; but Sunday observance would bring in another factor—God. Do the two rest upon the same foundation? They do not, unless the State is God, and God the State. However, that is just the proposition into which the National Reform doctrine invariably resolves itself.

LAST week we stated in a last-page note, that the Republicans of Wisconsin had declared in favor of the Bennett law; but we had not, at the time of making up our paper, seen a copy of the platform adopted by the convention which renominated Governor Hoard, and we find that we were misled by telegraphic statements, sent out evidently by those whose wish was father to their statements. That part of the Wisconsin Republican platform relating to the Bennett law, is as follows:—

> The Republican party in convention assembled, declares its devotion to the common school as the chief factor in the education of the people, and pledges itself to support, strengthen and defend it. It recognizes as valuable auxiliaries in the work of public education the private and parochial schools, supported without aid from public funds, and disclaims absolutely any purpose whatever to interfere in any manner with such schools, either as to their terms, government, or branches to be taught therein.

> We affirm the right and duty of the State to enact laws that will guarantee to all children sufficient instruction in the legal language of the State to enable them to read and write the same. We believe that the compulsory education law passed by the last Legislature is wise and humane in all its essential purposes, and we are opposed to its repeal, *but at the same time we assert that the parent or guardian has the right to select the time of year and the place, whether public or private, and wherever located, in which his child or ward shall receive instruction, and we pledge ourselves to modify the existing law so that it shall conform to the foregoing declarations.*
> We further believe that all children between the ages of seven and fourteen years should be protected by appropriate legislation from the evils, physical and mental, arising from their employment in factories and similar places of work, and that adequate provision should be made for the care of children incorrigibly truant.
> We are unalterably opposed to any union of Church and State, and will resist any attempt upon the part of either to invade the dominion of the other. We repudiate as a gross misrepresentation of our purposes the suggestion, come whence it may, that we will in any manner invade the dominion of conscience and trample upon parental rights or religious liberty. Our only purpose in respect to the educational policy of the State is to secure to all children within its borders, at the earliest practicable age, proper equipment for the discharge of the ordinary duties of citizenship, and to this end, alike important to the State, to the children, and to the parents of the children, we invite the co-operation and aid of all broad-minded and patriotic people.
This, we take it, comes far short of the indorsement desired by the ultra friends of the Bennett law. *America* says of it:—

> While this is not precisely a straddle, it is a campaign manifesto that does not seem to stand squarely on the ground which is expected to witness the triumph of true Americanism in domestic legislation.

IT is evident that the friends of the law do not find in the Republican indorsement all that they would wish to find; but it is pretty certain that there is in it all that there ought to be. As we remarked in our note last week, the law as it stands is unworthy the support of either of the great parties, and we are glad to know that it has been *fully* indorsed by neither party. The State will have very little trouble in guaranteeing to all children sufficient instruction in the English language to enable them to speak and write it. Every foreigner desires his child to have a knowledge of the language of the country, and every child desires such a knowledge for himself; and the fear that any considerable number of children, in any part of this country, will fail to secure the instruction necessary to enable them to read and write English, is practically groundless. The anti-foreign sentiment which is being so assiduously cultivated in certain quarters, would better be directed against foreign paternalism in government, than against the use of foreign languages in our schools. English, which is already the language of commerce in all nations, and which bids fair to supplant the French as the language of diplomacy, will certainly never fall into disuse in any part of this country.
