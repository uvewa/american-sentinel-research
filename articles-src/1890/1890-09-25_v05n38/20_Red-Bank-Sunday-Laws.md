THE Red Bank, New Jersey, *Register,* in vigorously opposing the enforcement of Sunday laws, says that there should be no such laws, and boasts that while in Red Bank there is an utter disregard of Sunday laws, yet the "town has the reputation of being the quietest and best ordered in the State," and, "unlike every other town in the county of Monmouth, there is no illegal liquor selling."
