GERMANY is not only a "Christian country," but it is a Protestant country, and religion is regularly taught in all the public schools, yet D. Adolf Harnack, one of the most prominent theologians of Germany, declares that if the Lutheran Church is not to fall in ruins altogether, she "must change her Confession, her style of sermons, and her teachings, not according to the wishes of the day, but according to the indisputable knowledge we have gained." Infidelity seems to be rapidly on the increase, and the law is vainly invoked to stay the rising tide of unbelief. This proves nothing against Christianity, but it is another demonstration of the utter impotency of a State religion, either to give or to conserve a proper moral tone in a people. [305]
