THE *Christian Union* is grieved because the sale of acids for removing ink stains is permitted in this country, and says: "A little bit of the thou-shalt-not policy of Russia might make a useful ingredient in the devil-take-the-hindmost policy of our democracy. Under a paternal form of government, the sale of such a mixture as this would probably be prohibited." Of course, what the *Christian Union* has in view is the ease with which checks can be raised by means of this acid; but the idea of making this the occasion of a plea for a paternal government, would be decidedly funny, did it not show the growing feeling in this country to make the Government everything to everybody. The "acid" referred to, which is generally sold under the name of "ink eradicator," is used by thousands of honest men in their every-day business, and is fast coming to be considered as indispensable in every counting room. The editor of the *Christian Union* should provide himself with a "check perforator," and thank his stars that he doesn't live in Russia.
