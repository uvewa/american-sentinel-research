THE *Churchman,* of this city, closes a careful review of the debate upon the bill to enlarge the appropriation for the Roman Catholic Bureau of Education, by calling on all Protestant societies receiving Government aid, to purge themselves in this matter by refusing any longer to participate, and says: "As it is to-day, by reason of participation, eyes are blinded and lips are dumb in the presence of wrong, and a department of the National Government made subservient to the Roman hierarchy." THE AMERICAN SENTINEL made the same suggestion some weeks ago, but, so far as we know, it has not been adopted, and we look for no better result from the good advice given by the *Churchman.*
