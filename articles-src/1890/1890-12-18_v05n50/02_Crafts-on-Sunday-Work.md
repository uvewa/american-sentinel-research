"BOTH the Decalogue, and codes of the most advanced governments," says Mr. Crafts, "forbid murder, thefts, adultery, false witness, and Sabbath work. Religion renders to God the things that are God's by forbidding these things chiefly as sins against God; governments renders to Caesar the things that are Caesar's by forbidding them only as crimes against man." But a failure to keep Sunday is not a crime against man, and should not be made so by law. Sunday is religious, and to require its observance is to require the observance of a religious institution.
