THE King's Daughters, an organization which, we regret to say, is hand in glove with the National Reformers, has a membership of over one hundred and sixty thousand. This order comprises an "unsectarian body of Christian women," having for their original object the advancement of religion and charity. But like the Woman's Christian Temperance Union they are spending time, money, and energy on side issues.
