MONDAY, December 1, the American Sabbath Union filed its certificate of incorporation. Its object is "to have the Sabbath generally observed as a day of rest and worship." "The founders of the Union are General O. O. Howard, Postmaster-General John Wanamaker, Col. Elliott F. Shepard, J. F. Hurst, J. M. King, Edward G. Andrews, Robert S. MacArthur, A. C. Widekind, Leighton Williams, Robert C. Alexander, W. R. Worrell, Alexander S. Bacon, and Chief Justice Noah Davis."

It will be observed that in stating the object of the Union its incorporators say, "To have the Sabbath generally observed as a day of rest and worship." They appeal to the law-making power to enable them to accomplish their object, therefore they appeal to the State to cause men to worship.
