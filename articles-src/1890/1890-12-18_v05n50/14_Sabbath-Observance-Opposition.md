THE *Young Men's Era* says of THE SENTINEL that it "is evidently published in the interest of those who oppose the general observance of the Sabbath day." It is evident that the editor of the *Era *knows nothing about THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. The editors of this paper keep the Sabbath, and use their influence to persuade others to keep it also, but they are opposed to all laws requiring anybody to keep either the Sabbath or any other day for any reason whatever. The Sabbath is a religious institution, and Sabbathkeeping is a religious observance; and both should be absolutely free from the trammels of civil laws.
