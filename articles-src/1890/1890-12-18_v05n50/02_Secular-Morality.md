# Secular Morality.

LAST week we examined very briefly a number of the so-called reasons given by the President of the American Secular Union for opposing the reading of the Bible in the public schools. The conclusion was that President Westbrook and those who hold with him, object to the Bible in the schools *because they do not believe it;* and that did they believe the Bible they would stand shoulder to shoulder with those who demand that it shall be read in our public schools. That this is true is further shown by what they themselves demand.

In the address before referred to, President Westbrook said:—

> The American Secular Union, more than a year ago, offered a prize of $1,000 for the best essay or manual to aid teachers in our free State schools to thoroughly instruct children and youth in the purest principles of morality without inculcating religious doctrines. ... We suggested that this essay should contain a comprehensive and suggestive exhibit, with familiar and practical illustrations of those universal foundation principles and axiomatic truths which underlie all sound morality and rightfulness, thus developing and educating that inherent moral sense which is more or less common to all rational human beings. In short, that it should show how to teach children the natural and essential difference between right and wrong, and the reasons therefor, without reference to sacerdotal creeds and sectarian dogmas. Authors of every grade have earnestly entered into friendly competition for this prize, and not one has found any difficulty in showing how to teach morality without offense to persons holding the most diversified and extreme views in religion. There is no difference of opinion in regard to morality. Jews and Gentiles, Mohammedans and [387] Greeks. Catholics and Protestants, Agnostics and Atheists, are all agreed in commending what is good and right, and in condemning what is bad and wrong, and one and all agree in the reasons therefor. Let us therefore teach morality in our State schools, but let us not attempt to introduce religion, concerning which scarcely any two persons agree.

We dissent most emphatically from the statement that “there is no difference of opinion in regard to morality.” *There is very wide difference of opinion both as to what constitutes mordis and also as to the standard and sanction of morals.* “Morality,” Webster defines thus:—

> The relation of conformity or non-conformity to the true moral standard or rule; the quality of an intention, a character, an action, a principle or a sentiment, when tried by the standard of right; the quality of an action which renders it good; the conformity of an act to the divine law, or to the principle of morals.

> “Moral,” used as an adjective, is defined by the same authority, as follows:—
> 1. Relating to duty or obligation; pertaining to those intentions and actions of which right and wrong, virtue and vice, are predicated, or to the rules by which such actions and intentions ought to be directed; relating to the practice, manners, or conduct of men as social beings in relation to each other, as respects right and wrong, so far as they are properly subject to rules.
> 2. Conformed to rules of right, or to the divine law respecting social duties; virtuous; just.
The definition of “right,” as applied to morals, is:—

> Conformed to the constitution of man and the will of God; never deviating from the true and just; according with truth and duty; unswerving; just; true.

In the light of these definitions, it is not too much to say that there is no such universal agreement as to what constitutes morality as Dr. Westbrook seems to imagine. In fact, opinions differ just as widely upon morals as upon religion, and that for the reason that the two are so closely related that it is impossible to teach the one without teaching also the other. As even Paine acknowledges in his “Rights of Man,” *“All religions are united with principles of morality*.”* *Indeed, principles of morality are a *part *of every religion, and religion has reference invariably to the practice of morality, and all religions appeal to some real or supposed supernatural power as authority on morals and for sanction for their codes of morals.

To teach morals is to teach rules governing action, *and the reasons for those rules. *Morals must have a sanction; and in every age and in every clime that sanction has been found in religion. Consequently the higher the prevailing conception of Deity, the purer and more perfect the code of morals of any people. The Apostle Paul simply states a truth when, in the first chapter of Romans, he shows that in proportion as the heathen forgot God, their morals became corrupt.

By “morals,” President Westbrook probably means no more than civility, or courtesy. Possibly he might carry it further than this and enforce a practical recognition of the self-evident truth that all men are created equal, and that they are by nature endowed with certain inalienable rights, and that it is the duty of every man to recognize the equal rights of his fellows. This is all good, and no one can come short of it and be truly moral; but it is very far from being the *sum* of good morals. All this can be, and is, practiced more or less fully with no reference to the divine law; but the morality of an act is determined by its “relation of conformity or non-conformity to the divine law.” That which leaves the divine law out of the question cannot be recognized by Christians as morality.

This brings us to another point, namely, that while it is true that the State cannot properly teach Christianity it has no more right to teach that which is contrary to Christianity. Morals must have a sanction, that is, the moral standard must rest upon, or be supported by, some authority. That standard, Webster says, is the divine law; and so Christians hold. It follows that to carry out the Secular Union scheme for teaching morals a different standard must be established, and the children must be taught that it is *the *standard; this at once places the State in antagonism to Christianity.

But as before intimated, the State has no more right to antagonize Christianity than it has to foster it. It follows, therefore, that the State must let *morals* alone; it may teach civility and civil justice upon the basis of the self-evident truth that all men are by nature endowed with certain inalienable rights, but it must not teach that this is morality, and that morals rest upon no higher authority than the mutual obligations of human beings. The Secular Union would better take the position that the State should confine its educational work to giving instruction in the exact sciences.C. P. B.
