"UNLESS morality is rooted in a reverent love of God, it will be driven before the sudden gusts of temptation like 'rattling autumn leaves' before the winter's winds. If it looks upon religion as the best 'Chief of the police' merely, and not as the interpreter of everlasting verities it must of necessity be destitute of force. Short of the willing sacrifice of self to the righteous claims of God, and the cheerful movement of the mind within the limits of a supreme law, there is no pure or durable morality. Religion is the root of which the purest morality is the flower. The flower cannot exist without the root; and the root cannot exist and have vitality without the inflorescence in morality." And yet men imagine that the State can teach morality, and that it can teach morals without teaching religion at that!
