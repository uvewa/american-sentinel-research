THE *Truth Seeker* relates the following story of petty persecution for opinion's sake, illustrative, also, of the folly of making criminal upon one day that which is held to be perfectly legitimate upon other days:—

> Returning from the American Secular Union Congress, Mr. L. K. Washburn stopped to lecture at Alliance, Ohio. There he learned of an attempt to preserve the "Sabbath" holy by persecuting a Freethinker. Mr. P. L. Dattlebaum, in common with other dealers, has kept his cigar store open on Sundays for years. He carries, in connection with cigars and tobacco, a line of gents' furnishing goods. His Sunday trade, however, has been mostly in cigars. One Sunday in October he sold a linen collar, and was notified the next morning by the police authorities to close his place of business on the following Sunday. He did so, but noticed that every other cigar dealer kept open store the same as usual. Not thinking all were treated alike, Mr. Dattlebaum opened his doors when the next Sunday came around and was arrested on Monday morning. He was again arrested in two weeks for the same offense. He appealed his case, and we shall await with interest the decision of the higher court. What makes the case look like persecution is that not another person has been ordered to close his cigar store or has been arrested for selling his goods on Sunday. Mr. Dattlebaum is an outspoken Freethinker, and thinks that religious prejudice has prompted the action against him. But imagine the authorities of a city or town giving a license to sell tobacco, cigars, etc., on Sunday, and prosecuting a man for selling a linen collar on that day, exclaims Mr. Washburn. It seems that? cleanliness is *not *next to godliness in the opinion of some people. We are at a loss to understand how a Christian can strain at a linen collar and swallow a plug of tobacco or a cigar on his Sabbath day. It would seem as though a man with a clean collar would make a better appearance on and do greater honor to the Sunday than a man with a cigar in his mouth, but evidently the Christian conscience is more wounded by the sale of clean linen on the Sunday than by the sale of a filthy weed.

Is it any wonder that infidels abound when such things are done in the supposed interests of Christian institutions?
