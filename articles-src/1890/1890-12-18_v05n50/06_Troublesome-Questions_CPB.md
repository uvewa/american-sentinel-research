A REVEREND gentleman in a Western town, discussing the question of religious instruction in the public schools, plaintively asks:—

> Suppose some little boy reads a paragraph about the star of Bethlehem; he raises his little hand and inquires of the teacher, "What is the star of Bethlehem?" Is the teacher to answer that the enemies of Protestant Christianity have removed that star from heaven?

Certainly not. To say that anybody has removed the star of Bethlehem from heaven would be a falsehood, and no teacher would be justified in lying to his pupils. In such a case the teacher should refer the pupil to his parents or guardian for the desired information.

But let us carry the supposition a little further: Suppose the Bible is used in the school and some little boy reads Mark 16:16, and asks, "What is baptism?'' Shall the teacher undertake to instruct [395] him upon that subject? Or, if the little fellow reads from Eze. 18:20, the words: "The soul that sinneth, it shall die," and asks the teacher to harmonize it with the doctrine of the immortality of the soul, shall the teacher undertake to instruct him in the various doctrines of future rewards and punishment? Or suppose the pupil should read 1 John 5:7, 8, and ask some question on the doctrine of the trinity, shall the teacher undertake to instruct him in regard to that? and if so, what particular doctrine shall he teach the child? Such questions instead of being avoided by the use of the Bible in the public schools are only multiplied, and nobody will pretend to say that it is the duty of public school teachers to undertake to answer them.
