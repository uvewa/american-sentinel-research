THE Blair Sunday-rest bill is still before Congress, waiting the opportune moment when it can be pushed forward by its friends with hope of success. It was introduced in the Senate by Hon. H. W. Blair, December 9, 1889, read twice, and referred to the Committee on Education and Labor. This bill has been repeatedly published, and is familiar to most of our readers. To those who have not given the matter thought, the law contemplated in the bill seems reasonable, and the arguments advanced in its favor plausible. We wish, at this time, to point out some of the reasons not only why the bill should not become law, but why every citizen of this Republic ought to raise his voice against it.

1. It is unconstitutional in that it is religious legislation. We know that it is claimed that it is not religious legislation; only a "civil Sabbath" is desired. But the Sabbath is not a civil institution; it is a religious institution, and the bill recognizes repeatedly that phase of the question. The bill is, according to the title, to secure to the people not only the privileges of rest, but of *"religious worship*."* *Among the prohibitions of Section 3, are works which are not the "observance [of the first day] as a day of *religious* worship." Thus the bill has a religious object, as shown in the title and the exceptions made. It is therefore religious legislation, and is contrary to the First Amendment to the Constitution, which declares that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." The first- day Sabbath is a so-called Christian institution, and its establishment by law is the recognition and establishment of that religious system to which the institution belongs. The Constitution is right, as proved by the history of all religious legislation of the past. The bill is unconstitutional, and therefore wrong.

2. The bill, if it became law, would subject many people—good, honest citizens—to the whims and caprices of their neighbors. The first section declares that no person, etc., "shall perform or authorize to be performed, any secular work, labor, or business *to the disturbance* of [396] others; . . . nor shall any person engage in any play, game, or amusement, or recreation *to the disturbance of others* on the first day of the week, commonly known as Sunday, or during any part thereof." See also section 6. There are many professed Sunday-keepers who believe in recreation on Sunday. There are many men, whose work confines them through the week, who find rest and recreation in working in their garden on Sunday. There are those who observe some other day as a Sabbath who, to support themselves and families, are compelled to work on the first day at their regular business, which they, of course, under the Constitution, have the right to do.

But why mention these classes? asks one. The law would not interfere with them if they did not "disturb others." But that is just the point. They could do no known work, they could indulge in no game or exercise on Sunday without disturbing some bigoted Sunday-keeper. Whether such an one saw his neighbor at work or not it would *disturb* him just as much as though that neighbor was hammering on his door-post. Many consciences are easily disturbed by the acts of others. The good Sunday-keepers of Scotland were so disturbed a few years since that they could leave their devotions on the day which they held as holy, to stone some fishermen who attempted to land fish on that day. Some good Sunday-keepers of the East are greatly disturbed because California has no Sunday law. Well-meaning and merciful men might, through mistake, pass such a law, but religious bigots would make it cruelly operative.

3. The bill is also a bid for injustice and oppression. Section 5 reads:—

> That it shall be unlawful to pay or receive payment or wages in any manner for service rendered or for labor performed or for the transportation of persons or of property in violation of the provisions of this act, nor shall any action lie [hold good] for the recovery thereof, and when so paid, whether in advance or otherwise, the same may be recovered back by whosoever shall first sue for the same.

A more iniquitous measure has not been framed in the nineteenth century. A man may be honestly employed by an honest man to do honest work on Sunday which interferes with no one but the men engaged. These men are there from choice. But under such a law as this the employer has no right to pay for the profits he has received from the poor man's labor; the poor man has no right to receive the compensation which is his due for service rendered and strength and time expended in legitimate, honest toil. His family may be suffering for the wages earned, but he has no right to receive them, and if he does, any vagabond, bigot, or rascal has the right to sue him and recover the same. The bill is worthy only of the Dark Ages. It is a sad thing that one man can be found to frame such a measure; it is sadder still to know that there are so many who will advocate and support it. But as it has been framed and supported, so certainly would it be enforced if it should become law.

4. The passing of such a bill would destroy not only religious equality but civil, or political, equality. It would divide by law the people of the United States into classes, so far as the law has jurisdiction. The first class, the highly honored, would be Sunday-keepers, placed in position by a mere majority. These would be granted absolute freedom. The second class would be those who observe another day, for whom a sort of exemption is made, which really is no exemption, and which would soon be swept away for obvious reasons, as soon as the law was enacted. The bill does not prohibit their laboring on Sunday, neither does it sanction it, but it makes its legitimacy depend on so frail a foundation as the "disturbance of others." The third class will be those who do not believe in the sacredness of Sunday or religious legislation, and who do not regard any day as the Sabbath. The law counts these as criminals, however faithful or conscientious they may be. This class discrimination does not come because one class is better citizens or better men, but solely on account of a religious tenet or institution. The Sunday would therefore be the sole difference. A matter of conscience (?) with the majority is made the matter of a crime in the minority. And the man who observed another day than Sunday, whose labor disturbed the consciences of others, would be compelled by the law to render one-sixth of his income for the sake of the majority. That is, the Government would exact from him one day in the week, which it would not from the Sunday-keeper. The foregoing is a sample of Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts's boasted "equality" and "justice" of Sunday laws.

5. Such a law as contemplated by the bill would place the Government against God. The Sabbath and religious worship belong to God alone. The observance of the one and the rendering of the other are duties which men owe to their Creator, and for which they will have to give account at his tribunal. When Government, therefore, attempts to regulate, limit, or define such duties, it arrogates to itself powers and prerogatives which belong only to God, and becomes a usurper. Jesus said, "Render therefore unto Cesar the things which be Cesar's, and unto God the things which be God's." The Sabbath belongs to God; to him it ought to be rendered, not by constraint, but of one's own free will.

The foregoing are some of the reasons why the Blair Sunday-rest bill should be opposed by every good citizen, every lover of liberty, and, more than all else, by every Christian. The gospel of Christ has naught to do with civil law.—*M. C. W., in Signs of the Times.*
