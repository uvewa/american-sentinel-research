THE public schools are for all creeds, or no creed—Catholic, Protestant or Agnostic; for all nationalities, native - born and foreign—for the American, the Irishman, the German or Italian. This makes them impartial, secular and comprehensive. No other system can exist in this country so long as it is republican in manner and form.—*National View.*
