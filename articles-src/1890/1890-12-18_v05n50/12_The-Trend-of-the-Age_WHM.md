## Paternalism The End.

A Western Prophet Of Evil.

> "It is generally conceded, I believe," said a well- known Western lawyer of prominence, "that we are not only growing more powerful as a Nation year by year, but that we are drifting slowly and surely toward what is called a paternal Government. Both of the political parties have contributed to that end. We have only to study the record of recent Congresses to note the rapidity with which we are travelling in that direction. The whole tendency of national legislation is to the enlargement of the powers and the extension of the duties of the general Government. Of late years my legal practice has involved some of the broader constitutional questions, and this gradual change has forced itself upon my attention. The political complexion of the new order of things does not disturb me. On the contrary, this gradual modification of our original system must be regarded as the legitimate and beneficial result of a higher state of civilization.

> Whether it is so regarded by all men or not, we may as well admit that such a change is in progress. There are those who lament the change. I do not. There are those who think this departure from the early tenets of our fathers is the forerunner of national decline and dissolution. But they are growing fewer every year. Even the great body of the Democratic party has cut loose from State rights and strict construction and become converts to the paternal school. In my section of the country the proposition for the general Government to assume ownership and charge of the telegraph lines and railroads is no longer looked upon as undesirable, but if put to vote in a general election it would receive the sanction of three-fourths of the people. If you and I live ten years longer we'll probably see it accomplished. Postal savings banks will follow. And—
> "The loaning of Government money on farm mortgages?" was suggested.
> "Very likely. Why not? Why shouldn't the farmers have an equal right with the national bankers?"
> "Are they all Socialists up there in the Northwest?"
> "If you call that Socialism three-fourths of us are Socialists. Not in the sense of wishing to turn things over at once by force, but as desiring a paternal Government by law, yes—nearly all.
> This frank avowal from the lips of a hard-headed lawyer and wealthy citizen, who makes his temporary home at the Hoffman House, was enough to deprive a man of his breath. He continues:
> "My statement is not a speculative one at all. Nor has it any political significance, in the narrow and common acceptation of that term. I am a Republican, but never was in politics, and never will be. I am speaking now as an independent citizen. I am speaking, too, only of the people of the section of country I know something about. Perhaps there are other sections where the sentiment is the same. [398] From what I read of the Farmers' Alliance in the South, and from the recent action of the railway employes in this State, and from general report of sentiment elsewhere I should say this idea was becoming general—but I do not insist on that. The cry of paternal Government is no longer a bugbear. In principle it is not a new departure. It is now only a question of growth. We begin to recognize this from the Supreme Court down."
> "Do you think this change in our system is the way to reach the greatest good to the greatest number?"
> "Ah, now you want an opinion!" he exclaimed. "My opinion on this point is worth no more than any other man's. To the public it is worth nothing. I have been merely stating facts that have come under my observation. I would not call it a change in our system—the system remains the same—elections by the present process, officers and terms of office the same. It is more properly a change in the application of the system and one contemplated as possible by the framers of the Constitution. It is the national progression of a great people. We improve on the old model as we go along. The war of '61 demonstrated that the original plan needed a vigorous overhauling. I think it improved things materially. Even those who opposed it, arms in hand, think so now. So the paternalizing of the Government—the bringing of it nearer to the new wants of the people—may result in increased personal happiness and national prosperity.
> "The question of farm mortgages is a very serious one in the Northwest. People who pay eight and ten per cent on their borrowed money begin to feel the hopelessness of their situation. The source of all national wealth is in the producer, and the agriculturist is the great producer. In times of financial stringency from over speculation, the Treasury of the United States comes promptly to the rescue of the Wall Street operator. Why should not the Government come to the assistance of the farmer when he gets in a financial hole? I do not suggest any particular way; but let it find some practical way."
> "What's the matter with the Government leaving the money with him, instead of taking it by taxation and loaning it back to him?" was inquired.
> This query rather floored the political economist from the Northwest, but he recovered in time to observe that it was a scheme worthy of consideration.
> "And in this progressive system of paternal Government where do you draw the line of demarcation, where the Government shall stop, and where the people may think and act for themselves? Will it be at the governmental control of the telegraph lines, the railroads, the establishment of postal savings banks, the taking up of the farm mortgages at a nominal rate of interest? Or will it extend its uniformed hand to the running of flouring mills, breweries and manufactories, &c."
> "I would draw no line. The representatives of the people in Congress assembled would presumably represent the views of their constituents in the matter. This Government is supposed to be by the people, of the people, and for the people. The trouble is that you consider the Government as something apart from, something not of, the people—it is the people, acting for themselves. The Government belongs to the people, and not the people to the Government. I have just been trying to enforce this idea in an argument before the Secretary of the Interior, at Washington, in a big land case. If the people want their Government to stand in its official capacity between them and poverty and ruin, they have the right to demand that it shall do so, and this without reference to preconceived theories, or of governmental systems of other countries. There is a legal way to express this demand, and that is through the ballot-box and the impartial administration of the laws made by their representatives."
The open expression of such sentiments as these, coupled with a clear view of the social, political, and legislative tendency of the times, is an evidence of the beginning of the end. Month by month it becomes more certain that there are increasing- numbers of able, influential men throughout the country, who not only see the political storm-cloud rising, but hail its coming as a coveted opportunity for action and the profitable exercise of their abilities.
