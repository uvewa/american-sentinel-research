AUSTIN, Minnesota, is agitated over the fact that Sunday work has been done on the new public school building in that town. The Methodist Sunday school recently adopted a series of resolutions denouncing the work as "a flagrant violation of the law, and an outrage upon the religious sentiment of this community, and an open assault upon the American Sabbath."
