A CONFERENCE, which was held in this city, of ministers from twenty-three ecclesiastical bodies called by the Presbyterian Synod to consider the necessity of introducing moral instruction into the public schools, revealed about as many different views as there were speakers. Of course, nothing is settled by such a discussion; certainly the public school system of the State is not likely to undergo any material change as a result of the Conference. It serves, though, a useful purpose in classifying ideas and stimulating thought; while from the general course of the discussion we may learn what to accept and what to reject.

Perhaps the most elaborate address was delivered by Mr. Wm. Allen Butler, who argued for the absolute divorce of the Church and State, and the freedom of religious opinion and worship as fundamental ideas in our system of constitutional Government as embodied in the Constitution of this State. So far, well. But when our speaker declares that "the legal status of the public schools in this State includes the existing and controlling power of the Christian religion," and further, that "the Constitution and law of this State authorize religious," but not as he says, "doctrinal teaching in the public schools," we cannot accept the statement. It is true that by general consent the Bible was for a long time, yet is, and may continue to be, read in the public schools. There is no objection to this when read by general consent. But on the other hand, as the Code of Public Instruction in this State says, "there is no authority in the law to use as a matter of right any portion of the regular schoolhours in conducting any religious exercises at which the attendance of the scholars is made compulsory;" and again says the Code, "Neither the common school system nor any other social system can be maintained unless the conscientious views of all are respected." In such utterances and others that might be quoted the legal status of the public schools in this State is shown to be different from that stated by Mr. Butler.

We cannot as a people too strongly insist that religion in the public schools shall not be taught against the opposition of those who support the schools. We indeed hear not a little—and the plea went in the Conference—about teaching "nonsectarian Christianity," as being the common law of the land. Touching this we remark, first, there is no such thing as non-sectarian Christianity; and secondly Christianity is not the common law of the land. As to the first, reading a Protestant version of the Bible is sectarian as against the Douay or Roman Catholic version. As to the second, even in England, whence the common-law theory is derived and applied to this country by its advocates, Lord Coke declared "the common law adapted itself to the religion of the country just so far as was necessary for the peace and safety of civil institutions, and only where by their inevitable effects they became offenses against *man and his temporal security.* In like tenor was the decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Court [Commonwealth *vs.* Kneeland]; of Justice Clayton of Delaware [State *vs.* Chandler]; while the Supreme Court of Ohio [Bloom *vs.* Richards], declares, "Neither Christianity nor any other system of religion is a part of the law of this State." We could quote at greater length but have not the space.

To conclude: We have religion, but the State may not teach it. ... We must keep our public schools as they are—that is, keep them from sectarian teaching. In this way alone will the State preserve the school against the assaults of the Roman Catholics who would disestablish the system if they could. It will be an evil day for the State that sees the downfall of the public school system through the machinations of the Roman Catholics, and that is the way its downfall will be compassed, if, indeed, it ever is, which God forbid.—*Christian at Work.*
