# Violation of Sunday Laws.

At the present term of the court Judge Young had some cases before him, presented by the Grand Jury, charging certain merchants with violation of the Sunday law. This is the second term of the court within eighteen months, at which the violation of this law has been called to the attention of the court. At the first term the fines imposed by the court were nominal. At this ter m the court sentenced the parties violating the law to fines as high as fifty dollars, and costs. It is to be presumed that Judge Young intends not only to punish those who may violate the law, but to deter others from violating it. This manner of enforcing the law, will secure its observance in this parish.—*Tensas *(*Louisiana*)* Gazette.*

It would be well if at our next term of court an investigation should be made into the prevalent way of keeping the Sunday law in this parish.

There is a good deal to be said against this law, but if the Government of the country is to take charge of the morals of the people, then the Sunday law should be rigorously enforced everywhere. In fact there seems no reason why the New England “Blue Laws” should not be revived and put in force.—*Madison *(*Louisian*a) *Journal.*

THE *Lutheraner*, of St. Louis, Mo., thus defines the attitude of the German Lutherans toward the use of the English language in their schools:—

Not only has the English a place in the curriculum of our schools, but it is treated as a second mother tongue, and in a number of branches is the medium of instruction. It may be that here and there in the country districts this plan is not fully carried out; but these are exceptions to the rule, the removal of which is our constant endeavor.

The synods which urge the duty upon parents of having their children educated in the Christian schools, at the same time emphasize the duty of providing such instruction in English, that the children may be able take their place in a community in which the English is the prevailing language. When it comes to statistics, it may turn out to be that, on the whole, the public schools accomplish no better results in the English than do the parochial schools. The German Lutherans are opposed to the Bennett law, *not because it demands a certain amount of English,* but because this law is a gross interference of the State in the domain of the Church.

For, according to the Bennett law, it is possible to compel parents to educate their children in the public schools, where no religious instruction is imparted, even if the children in the parochial schools know three times as much English as the law demands. [391-392]

SENATOR BLAIR’S friends are hopeful of his re-election.

Now that Congress is again in session we may expect a renewal of efforts to secure from the law-making power some substantial recognition of Sunday sacredness.

A PACIFIC Coast exchange says that at the next session of the Legislature of California, a Sunday-law bill will be introduced, and the people are being generally solicited to petition for it.

BEFORE the State can teach religion it must have a religion to teach. But the State being not a single individual but an aggregation of individuals, it can have a religion only in the sense of having a creed which it fosters. Are the American people ready for that sort of thing?

REV. DR. WILLIAM T. MELOY, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, Vinton, Iowa, says: “Keep the Bible out of the schools and our children are deprived of moral instruction.” This might be true of Dr. Meloy’s children, but we are persuaded that most ministers give their children moral instruction at home; indeed we do not see how it could be true of any children in *Christian* homes. Homes in which moral instruction is not given are not Christian, even though the head of the house may publicly minister in sacred things.

THE Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, *Press* of the 23d ult., has the following editorial notice of the late Law and Order Convention in that city:—

> Although the Law and Order Convention has been condemning in unmeasured terms the “desecration” of Sunday in any manner, including the running of railroad trains, yet all the delegates to the late Convention here, save three, left the city last night or this morning. Some went last night to distant cities, so they will be traveling all day Sunday, while others did not even make a pretense of avoiding a start on Sunday, but leave Pittsburg this morning. It is possible the gentlemen do not consider that they are amenable to the moral laws they expounded so diligently all the week. They may think that anything that they do is sanctified by the fact that *they* do it, and that the wicked engineers, firemen, conductors, ticket-sellers, and other railroad officials who are forced to labor that the Law and Order people may reach home, are absolved because they are doing evil in a holy cause.

> This may be the way the Law and Order delegates look at it, and then again, perhaps they do not give the matter any thought at all. The general public, however, will wonder at the presumption and inconsistency of those people who dare to condemn others for sins they commit themselves.
The *Press* should understand that the Sunday-law advocates want Sunday laws in order that they may not be tempted to travel on what they regard as sacred time. In short they want civil laws to restrain them from sin, just as the judicious mamma puts the preserves upon the top shelf of the pantry in order that Johnny may not be *tempted* to pilfer them.

ON a recent Sunday evening, a prominent Sabbath Union orator was holding forth to a small audience in a church in this city; on the opposite corner Gilmore’s band was discoursing sweet music to a crowded house. The situation was not to the orator’s liking, and, in the bitterness of his soul, casting a sad look upon his handful of hearers, he remarked, “If you would close up that synagogue of Satan over there you would have more people in here.” And that desire—the wish to fill the churches—accounts for the milk in the American Sabbath Union cocoanut.

A GENTLEMAN, of Alabama, recently wrote to the Albany *Law Journal* asking: “What legally-constituted tribunal ever decided that one day in the week was more ‘holy ’ than another? If so on what authority?” The question was called out by the remark of the *Journal* that a man who shaves on Sunday “cheats the Lord out of his time.” The *Journal* responded

> We really are not competent to answer the inquiry, and we turn the inquirer over to the *Independent,* which is much better informed on the point than we are. The idea of the “Lord’s time” is simply a notion which we hold in common with a good many other superstitious people.

The *Independent* also evidently felt unequal to the task of answering the question, for instead of discussing the query, it launched out upon a long justification of Sunday laws upon so-called civil grounds. Why not answer the question and tell the Alabama man where, when, and how Sunday was made holy?

AT a recent Teacher’s Institute in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, the subject of religion in the public schools was discussed. “Dr. Noss,” says the Pittsburg *Dispatch,* “paid a high tribute to the German system, which he said cultivated the pupil’s thinking powers, physical powers, and moral powers. He did not think that the Protestant teachers should be greatly offended when their Catholic contemporaries speak of the godlessness of the public schools. He was of the opinion that religion should go hand in hand with secular training, and that the result would be that the moral education of children would be greatly furthered.”

Superintendent Luckey took issue with Dr. Noss in regard to religion in the schools. He said that if intense religious instruction would produce a nation of infidels like the Germans, he did not want religious instruction in American schools. It was impossible, he. said, to give secular and religious instruction in the public schools.

THE *Christian Index,* of Atlanta, Georgia, comments thus upon the election of a Baptist as Governor of that State:—

> The Baptists are a very considerable folk numerically, in this State, and it is pleasant to know that they are able to contribute, from their ranks, men fitted for eminent station. Indeed the affairs of State, are often safer in the hands of a Baptist than any other, if they are true to their denominational training. This demands that they be exact and true and never for one moment seek to use power for the special benefit of their denomination. Baptists draw the line between the Church and State with a broad pen, and look with suspicion upon any trenching upon either side. The influences which Baptist doctrines have doubtless had upon our new Governor will protect the general body of the people from anything like an undue pressure from the denomination with which he is allied. So the State is to be congratulated in its chief officer, who true to himself and his principles will rule equally among all his people and in the interest of the general good alone.

If the Baptists of Georgia are as true to their principles as the *Index* expects Governor Northern to be, there will be no such pressure for the Governor to withstand.

AMONG the bills introduced in the Vermont Legislature is: “A bill prohibiting traveling on Sunday, except to church, or on errands of humanity and charity.” The people of the whole United States ought to go to the expense of presenting a large leather medal to those Vermont Solons:— *Western Herald.*

EX-MINISTER PHELPS is authority for the statement that the number of foreigners using English has increased one hundred fold the past thirty years. Yet some people are alarmed lest a knowledge of the language becomes practically extinct in some of our Western communities!

FOR men to cease to cry out against injustice is as if they thought that God was dead.—*William T. Stead.* [393]
