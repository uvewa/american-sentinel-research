THE writer had the privilege December 1, 1889, of hearing Rev. W. F. Crafts speak twice upon the reasons why this nation should make and enforce a National Sunday Law. Among the chief considerations urged by the speaker was the great benefit it would be healthwise to the American people. He argued that their greed for gain or the fear of losing their places of labor prevented them from taking proper rest. This want of rest was breaking down the health of the laboring men of America and therefore the Government is in duty bound to interfere from a sanitary consideration. He referred to the suggestions that had been made by some that *"rest"* could be obtained on other days of the week besides Sunday. To this proposition he. would not agree. The rest must be on Sunday so as to give the working man the benefit of a quiet day in which he could attend church with his family. He would have people understand that Sunday work is uncivil because it disturbs those who desire a quiet rest on that day. The law is absolutely necessary in order that the people may reap the healthful benefit of a Sunday rest. Breaking the Sabbath he said is a crime against man because it deprives him of his rest. That is the man who works on Sunday is uncivil because other people want to rest and this constitutes it a crime. If the speaker occupied a tenable position, then labor on Sunday not only injures the health of the man who works on that day but his labor also makes his neighbors unhealthy. For these reasons the Government ought to prevent Sunday labor.

He stated in his speech in the afternoon of the day that I heard him, that he had been doing police duty during a part of the forenoon, and that he had discovered some very bad things, indeed, going on in the city (Indianapolis). He thought most of the saloons were closed yet he found that in a few of them, clerks were deprived of their rest by having to do duty at the bar. He did not seem to condemn the saloon business only so far as it caused work to be done on Sunday. He expressed much sympathy for saloon clerks, lamenting because they were so badly overworked that they were becoming unhealthy because of so much Sunday work! The other item of Sunday work that he discovered was so much worse than the labor of the saloon clerks that he was moved exceedingly. It was even horrid to think of. The thing that was so wonderfully bad was the labor of some mechanics laying a marble floor in the post- office building. He said that the excuse the postal department had to offer for having the work done on Sunday was that on that day the building was comparatively clear of the people who on other days came for their mail and this consideration made it necessary to do the work on Sunday. He stated that it was not at all necessary, however, to do the work on that day as the work could be done during the night. It seemed rather strange that a speaker who was arguing that the Government should make a law for the protection of the health of the laboring man, to advise in the same speech that the Government ought to hire men to work in the night in order to protect the sacredness of Sunday. At this juncture every careful listener could see the wolf clearly expose himself as he turned under his sheep skin.

Logic demands that we accept all the conclusions that can be logically drawn from the premises which we occupy. The speaker took his stand squarely on the premises that it is the duty of the Government to enact laws compelling people to take care of their health, enforcing rest upon them from a sanitary consideration. Not only must the Government tell men how much they must rest but when they must rest. This rest must be on the time that the majority want to rest. But they choose this particular time to rest because of their "religious convictions."

Conclusion First: The *time* of the rest will be enforced altogether from a religious standpoint. Therefore it is a religious law.

Conclusion Second: If it is the duty of the Government to let the preachers dictate concerning the particular time to rest because of a sanitary consideration, then the Government is also under obligation to have the preachers decide which is the most healthful mode of baptism because of a sanitary (?) consideration. Further, when they have decided, then the Government must compel everybody to be baptized in that particular manner. This is necessary in order that there may be uniformity in the matter and that the people may not be allowed to injure their health by being baptized contrary to sanitary laws. This of course would only be [77] enforcing the "civil aspect" of baptism. Of course the "religious aspect" would be left entirely to the liberties of the persons being baptized. This would not in the least interfere with the freedom of any body's conscience. They would be left free to be baptized as they choose. This would not be State religion at all. It would simply be "the State and religion."

Conclusion Third: As the Government must decide how much a man may work and when he shall not work on account of his health; therefore the Government ought to say how much a man may sleep and when he shall not sleep. This is demanded by a sanitary necessity. Also there should be a national law regulating the quantity and the quality of the laboring man's food, with an appendix setting forth the time of day in which he must take his meals lest he should eat too much or too little, or dine at an improper time and thereby injure his health. This is necessary from the nature of the case.

The Government must also of necessity make out a national medical prescription for its citizens and make them take their medicine whether they are willing or not. The public good demands all this and much more upon the same hypothesis that Mr. Crafts argues his sanitary Sabbathlaw. But as there appears to be no end to the ridiculous things that are logically included in his premises, we will close, believing that the reader who has noted the inconsistencies and self-contradictions of National Reformers will not be surprised at anything from them. WM. COVERT.
