THE *Kaleidoscope,* a bright 8-page college paper, comes to us from South Lancaster, Massachusetts. It is conducted by the students of South Lancaster Academy, and is an excellent paper. We wish both the *Kaleidoscope* and the institution which it represents abundant success. For terms of subscription, etc., see advertisement on another page. [81]
