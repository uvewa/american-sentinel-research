# Sunday Rest Leagues.

THE *Pearl of Days,* official organ of the American Sabbath Union, makes the following announcement in its issue of February 7, 1890:—

The Sunday Closing Association, of Chicago, acting upon the Roman military principle of “carrying the war into Africa,” has prepared “a plan for the organization of the Sunday-rest people in each ward” into Sunday-rest leagues. The constitution thus defines the purposes and terms of membership:—

> ART. 2.—The object of this league shall be to cooperate with the Chicago Sunday Closing Association in securing, by all proper means, freedom from unnecessary Sunday labor, and especially the closing of factories, shops, stores, and saloons on Sunday.

> ART. 3.—This league shall be composed of representatives of the whole population of the—ward, independent of sectarian control or party dictation. Any citizen who is in favor of the object of this association and desires to aid in the furtherance of the same may become a member by signing this constitution.
Ward organizers will be appointed to carry out these provisions. Efforts will be made to secure the selection of aidermen at the coming city election who favor the closing of saloons on Sundays and the cessation of all unnecessary work on that day. No sect, faction, or special influence will control the ward leagues. The men who want to rest on Sunday will control the ward organizations, and they will have the opportunity of making their influence felt at the ballot-box, whether of independent candidates or for nominees of either political party who will favor Sunday rest. By this method of working the city, which is substantially after the long-established ways of the old political organizations, the Sunday Closing Association expects to develop, direct, and establish public opinion for practical advances upon the enemy’s works. It is “bearding the lion in his den.” The idea is novel, inspiring, and bold. Its results will be watched with interest, and the example, if even partially successful in the great city of the West, will be followed in more favorable localities. It means much more than mass meetings and strings of resolutions.

*The Colorado Graphic* remarks that “the renewal of the Blair Educational Amendment Resolution and Sunday-rest Bill before the Fifty-first Congress is causing many thoughtful men to reflect seriously as to the proper relation of the Church and the State, and religion and the public schools.”

*The Graphic* also says that “Sunday special laws are religious laws and unconstitutional. To ask for religious legislation is to degrade religion and weaken its influence. Christ taught this. The word of God teaches it from Genesis to the Revelation.” [71-72]

THE idea of “one-seventh part of time” being necessary for physical rest is a fraud, and is based on a fraud.

IT is liberty that mankind wants, not gracious coddling. It is the right to make the most of powers and opportunities, every man in his own fashion, and not such regulations as the stable proprietor gives to his horses in order that they shall not be overworked or underfed.— *New York World.*

THE Nashville *Christian Advocate* says:

> The Church needs more power rather than more machinery. It is a malign paradox of ecclesiastical history that as power declines machinery increases.

True enough. And the power of the churches in the United States has declined, and the machinery has increased to that extent that nothing short of the machinery of the national Government is counted of any worth. And in the enactment and enforcement of the National Sunday-law, they demand that this machinery shall be set in motion.

A FEDERATION of the churches of the United States is earnestly advocated by Dr. McCosh, ex-president of Princeton College, somewhat after the mode of the Federal Government of the United States. We should not fee surprised if some such scheme as that would yet be entered into by the churches. The organization of the Church upon the political model of the Empire in the fourth century was the one grand step in the organization of the Papal hierarchy. “Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say A confederacy.” Isa. 8:12.

UNDER the leadership of the so-called Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, of Rhode Island, the friends of prohibition in that State, are being organized into a sort of fourth-party called the “Prohibitory League,” with the object of getting a prohibition amendment to the State Constitution adopted again. A prohibition amendment was adopted in 1886, and was repealed in 1889. And now the prohibition Woman’s Christian Temperance Union propose to have it again enacted. At this rate the Constitution of Rhode Island becomes practically of no more weight than is any act of the legislature. It is the just pride of the American people, that their liberties are guarded by written Constitutions. When Constitutional provisions are reduced to the level of Statute law, to be enacted or repealed at the caprice of parties, then constitutional government is gone and liberty with it; and nothing remains but an unchecked and therefore unmitigated despotism. In this way the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union and the Third and Fourth party Prohibition parties are doing far-reaching and untold evil.

NATIONAL Reform principles are gaining ground in other countries as well as in our own. The *Christian Statesman* of February 13 makes the following announcement:—

> A Hindoo gentleman has called a congress of Brahmin priests and learned men for the purpose of incorporating the Bible among the sacred books of India, and officially recognizing Christ as the last spiritual Avatar, or incarnation of Brahma, the supreme deity.

When they shall have *officially* recognized Christ, and incorporated the Bible, India will be a Christian nation of course, just as officially to recognize Christ and the Bible in our national constitution will make this a Christian nation.

THROUGH contentions in the Legislature New York City stood in much danger of losing the World’s Fair for 1892. Mass meetings were held this week, on Tuesday, to create such a public sentiment as might bring the Legislature to concerted action. In the preliminary meeting that was held to organize for the mass meetings, the principal speech was made by Colonel Shepard of the *Mail and Express,* and one point on which he laid special stress was this:—

> Ask the ministers to pray for pleasant weather on that day, and do not do any of your preparatory work on Sunday.

But Hon. Chauncey M. Depew said that he read in the Bible “Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God,” and on the strength of that text he spent all day Sunday in the endeavor to bring the warring factions to an agreement, and he was successful. The mass meeting was a splendid success; but it was evident to everybody that that success was vastly more owing to Mr. Depew’s Sunday work than to Mr. Shepard’s Sunday rest.

ANOTHER step by Congress toward legislating in behalf of religion appears in a bill—Fifty-first Congress, S. 1748—introduced by Senator Vance, of North Carolina, “For the Relief of the Sisters of the Holy Cross in the City of Washington, District of Columbia,” which provides that—

> From and after the passage of this act a certain piece of land in the city of Washington, District of Columbia, known as lot sixteen, in square two hundred and forty-seven of the plan of that city, and owned and occupied by the Sisters of the Holy Cross, and all the buildings and grounds or property appurtenant thereto and used in connection therewith, in the District of Columbia, shall be exempt from any and all taxes and assessments, national, municipal, or county; and all taxes or assessments, together with the interest and penalties now due and unpaid upon said property shall be, and they are hereby remitted.

Why should the property of “the Sisters of the Holy Cross” be exempt from all taxes and assessments, any more than the property of everybody else? What is the particular benefit of the Sisters of the Holy Cross, over everybody else, to the nation, the city, and the county, that their property should be exempt from all taxes and assessments at the expense of everybody else in the nation, the city, and the county? It will doubtless be answered that this is church property, and that all church property is exempt. Then we would ask the same questions in regard to all the church property in the nation. Why should the people be required thus to pay tribute to the churches? If Congress can require that this measure of tribute shall be paid by the public to the churches, why can it not also require that all the revenues required by the churches shall likewise be paid by the public? If so much shall be done when it is asked, what is to hinder the doing of all the rest as it shall be asked? Our comments upon the bill concerning the clock and bells are to be applied to this bill also; and of this, too, we say, Let it be killed. And let every other like it be annihilated throughout the Union.

THE Fresno (Cal.) *Inquirer,* a live newspaper published in the metropolis of the San Joaquin Valley, has a “Department of Church and State and Temperance,” ably edited by N. J. Bowers, a former contributor to the columns of the AMERICAN SENTINEL. We are glad that the secular press not only in California, but very generally throughout the country, is waking up to the importance of this question; and this is the more encouraging from the fact that a large majority of the secular papers are opposed to so-called National Reform, and to the schemes of the American Sabbath Union. We bid the *Inquirer* Godspeed in its new departure, and trust that it will add greatly both to its popularity and to its influence. [73]
