# Government and the Sermon on the Mount.

(By the Bishop of Peterborough, England.)

*(Continued.)*

WHEN we have seen, however, that a Christian State is bound only by those precepts of Christ which are addressed to it as such, does it therefore follow that it is freed from all moral obligations whatsoever, or that its morality is something different in its nature from that of the individual? Nothing of the kind. The State is bound by precisely the same morality that binds the individual; for morality is not a duty of positive, but of natural obligation, and is binding therefore on all men under all possible circumstances. The State may not, any more than the individual may, act immorally in the discharge of its trust. As he may not lie nor steal for his wards, so neither may the State. It may not, for instance, in the interests of its citizens, plunder the property of other States, or lie to them, or take unfair advantage of them in any way. Similarly in all its dealings with its own subjects it must be scrupulously and equally just. But this is a natural and not a distinctively Christian obligation. Morality and justice were not created, nor even revealed, by Christ; they existed, and were known to exist, before the giving of the Sermon on the Mount, and would have continued to exist had that discourse never been spoken, or had He who spoke it never appeared among men.

[Here the Bishop makes a singular slip. The State is a person only by a legal fiction, as a railroad company or any other corporation is a person. But to say that the State is a *moral* person, is to speak beyond all manner of propriety. “The State, as separated from the individuals who compose it, has no existence except in a figure.” “The State is the people organized into a political body.” “The State owes to its own citizens all that it is.” The State as an acting thing is, and can be, represented only in the persons who hold the power of the government or the administration. The State, of itself, can do no wrong. When wrong is done the moral guilt attaches only to the persons who are the administration or the Government. The State cannot steal. If any of the officers of the United States Government to-day should steal, the person who stole would bear the guilt of the theft, even though he should have Stolen for the benefit of the State. Queen Victoria or Lord Salisbury could not do a dishonest thing, and pass over the moral guilt to the account of the British Empire. The Parliament of England cannot pass a cruel or oppressive act and then expect the guilt to fall upon the State. The individual members of the Parliament, as *individuals,* would each be guilty, as he participated in the wrong. When Clive employed the trick of changing documents, and committed forgery to [69] obtain possessions in India for the British State, it was *he* and not the State who was guilty of the forgery.—*Editor.*]

We have yet to consider how far the State is justified in enforcing the precepts of Christ upon its subjects. Of such an attempt I have said that it would result in the establishing of an intolerable tyranny. His great law, as we have seen, is that of self-sacrifice entire and absolute, even to the giving up of life itself when he demands it. Now self-sacrifice, being opposed to the natural instinct of self-preservation, can only become possible by the help of some strong, deep passion, which overmasters this natural instinct. That passion in Christ’s kingdom is love. Now this constraining motive is precisely that thing which the State cannot supply. It has no power to kindle in men’s hearts that consuming fire of divine love which burns out the selfishness of human nature. Nor has it “treasure in heaven” wherewith to reward those who sacrifice for it treasures upon earth. The State, therefore, if it is to be just, must not demand in the name of law what can only be demanded or conceded in the name of love. To demand them, apart from that condition which can alone make them endurable, would be to act unjustly and tyrannically.

## The State Cannot Enforce Christ’s Precepts.

In the next place, however, it is to be observed that the attempt to enforce Christian precepts by the State can never prove successful. It is not possible for the State really to enforce any precept of Christ. As a proof of this let us take this very question of Christian socialism. Christianity, as it seems to me, is manifestly neither socialistic nor communistic, inasmuch as it does not require as a condition of membership in the Christian society either the abolition of property, which is communism, or any form of compulsory redistribution of it, which is socialism. It would be communistic if it had said that no Christian shall possess property. It would be socialistic if it had said that every Christian shall submit to a certain redistribution of his property by the rulers of the Church. It says, however, neither of these things. In the impulsive attempt at communism, recorded in the Acts of the Apostles, the right of each individual to give away or to retain his property as he might think fit is distinctly recognized. “Whilst it remained was it not thine own? After it was sold was it not in thine own power?” This is not communism. In all its many precepts of benevolence and charity, the amount and the manner of distribution by the rich to the poor is left to the judgment and conscience of the individual. This is not socialism. Let us suppose, however, the State proceeding to enforce some one of these Christian precepts of benevolence,—such, for instance, as this: “Charge them who are rich in this world that they be ready to give and glad to distribute;” and that it does this by taking forcibly from the rich and distributing to the poor. Is it not clear that the moment the State has done this it has made it impossible to obey this precept? For how dan a man “give” that which the State has taken from him, or “distribute” that which the State is distributing in his stead? And as for the gladness and the readiness in such a case, we all know what is the gladness and the readiness with which we greet the visits of the ratecollector. The State would, in that case, have substituted for a charitable gift a legal impost, and would thereby have destroyed the freewillingness which is of the very essence of all Christian charity.

If socialism then means—what I suppose most persons would understand it to mean—the forcible redistribution of wealth by the State, Christian socialism is a contradiction in terms; for Christianity knows nothing of force; its motive power is love, and where force begins love ends. And this is the real meaning of the saying that we cannot make men virtuous by act of Parliament. We cannot do so because freewillingness is of the essence of all virtue. We can, therefore, no more have State Christian benevolence than we can have State Christian temperance, or State Christian chastity, or State Christian virtue of any kind whatsoever. To talk, therefore, of the State, in this matter of socialism, “compelling men to obey the precepts of Christ” is to talk undiluted and mischievous nonsense.

## The State Cannot Become The Church.

The conclusion from all that I have said seems to me then to be briefly this: The Church is not and cannot become the State; the State is not and cannot become the Church. These words stand for two wholly distinct and different societies, having different aims, different laws, and different methods of government. The State exists for the preservation of men’s bodies; the Church for the salvation of their souls. The aim of the State, even put at its highest, is the welfare of its citizens in this world; the aim of the Church is their holiness here in order to their welfare hereafter. The duty of the Church is to eradicate sin; the duty of the State is to prevent or to punish crime.

When we hear pious men clamoring for the State to “put down” this because it is “so wrong,” or to enforce that because it is “so right,” insisting, that is to say, that the State shall constitute itself the guardian of men’s souls as it is the guardian of their bodies, and as such that it should repress all vice and all irreligion as it is bound to repress all crime—we are amazed that they do not see what results would follow from their principles if logically carried out. Once, and once only, in our history were they so carried out. It was during the brief but terrible reign of the saints in England; and those who know what a sour, sullen, and dreary tyranny that reign established, what hypocrisy it fostered, and what a wildly licentious reaction it produced, may well view with anxiety symptoms of an attempt to revive such a government among us now, believing that it would result in a fussy, prying, omnipresent, and utterly unendurable rule of faddists and of fanatics, to be followed after a time by just such an outburst of licentiousness as marked the period of our Restoration. It is for this reason that I, for one, do not care to see the sanction of Christianity invoked in behalf of any schemes of political change. Christianity is no more a “judge and divider” of men’s “inheritance” now than was her Master long ago. Men may not now any more than they might then “take him by force to make him a king.”
