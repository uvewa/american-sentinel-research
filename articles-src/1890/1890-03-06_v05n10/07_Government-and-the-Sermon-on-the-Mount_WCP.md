## CHRISTIANITY AND SOCIALISM.

SPEAKING as a Christian then and not as a politician, I would venture to say to the Socialist: Deal with all these questions of redistribution of wealth with which you are busying yourself as you may deem right and expedient. Adopt for your guidance in dealing with them any one of the current political or social maxims that may commend itself to you. Start, if you please, with the maxim that all property is robbery; or that all men have an equal right to an equal share in all things; or that property should pay ransom for its safety; or that the State should own not only all land but all goods and chattels whatsoever; or that it should regulate the hours and price of all labor, and, therefore, by just and necessary consequence, ultimately the price of all other commodities; that it should, in short, convert itself into a sort of magical "universal provider," giving to everyone everything that he wants and yet to no one more than to any one else. Adopt even, if any one has the courage now to adopt it, the preposterous and immoral maxim of "the greatest happiness of the greatest number"—a maxim which would justify a tribe of red Indians in torturing, or a tribe of cannibals in killing and eating their prisoners. Take as your political creed any one of these or any other that you may prefer; all that we ask of you is not to dignify any one of these beliefs with the name of Christian. Stamp your political coinage, whether of pure or of base metal, with the image and superscription of the political Cesar, mob or monarch, to whom you give your allegiance; buy with it in the vote market power and place for yourself or your party; but do not forge upon it the "image and superscription" of our King.

Two things only, as it seems to me, has Christianity to say to you. One is, in all your dealings with wealth and property be just; just to the rich as well as to the poor, to the employer as well as to the laborer, to the minority as well as to the majority, to the classes as well as to the masses. And in the next place—pleading as Christianity is ever bound to plead, the cause of the poor—we pray of you, for their sakes, to take heed lest you make any economic mistakes in constructing your new *couches sociales,* for if you do it will not be the rich but the poor who will be the chief sufferers.

One word more, and it is a word that I am very desirous of saying. When I assert, as I do, that the laws of Christ's Church cannot safely or justly be all of them transferred to the statute book of the State, I am as far as possible from asserting that Christianity has nothing to do with politics. On the contrary, I maintain that it has everything to do with them: not, however, directly but indirectly: not by way of compelling men by law to observe its precepts, but by way of inspiring men with its spirit. Justice, which is the primary and main obligation of the State, is, as I have said, no invention of Christianity; nevertheless Christianity has greatly enlarged and ennobled our ideas of justice while giving us also new and most powerful motives for being just.

## CHRISTIANITY IN POLITICS.

It has done so mainly by its revelation of the great idea of the brotherhood of all men in Christ. This idea at once enlarges the area over which justice is obligatory. There was a time, when no State held itself bound to be just to any save its own subjects. The stranger had absolutely no claim in its eyes to justice; he might be plundered, captured, enslaved, slain, and no one so much as dreamed that any injustice was being done to him. Christianity has proclaimed that this stranger is a brother, and has therefore against all men the claims and the rights of brotherhood. Such teaching at once revolutionizes the relations of State to State, proclaiming as it does that whatever of justice any State owes to its own subjects, the same is owed by it to those of other States.

Take one instance more—the influence of Christianity upon legislation as regards the poor. Christianity has not said that there shall be no poor, nor has it in any way enlarged the poor man's rights as a citizen. But in telling us that he is our brother, it bids us be willing, and even eager, to recognize whatever rights he may possess. Christianity acts, not by filling the statute books with Christian precepts, but by filling the hearts of legislators with Christian feelings and motives. If we want, however, to check, or even to destroy, this beneficent work of Christianity, we shall do so effectually by attempting to force all its teachings upon all men in the shape of positive enactments. [78] The clumsy hands of the State are incapable of administering those Divine laws which deal with the conscience and the soul. If it meddles with these it will either perilously relax them least they prove too severe, or, in attempting to enforce them, it will excite against them a dangerous revolt.

All along the stream of living water which, issuing from beneath the cross of Christ, follows us through the world's wilderness, grow the fresher leaf and riper fruit of Christian life; but, if touched by the freezing breath of force it hardens into a cold, lifeless, and yet fragile mass, which chills and withers even unto death all that it once cherished and sustained.

## The Duty Of The Church In The State.

When, however, we have thus defined the spheres of Church and State—when we have seen that these lie in different planes and are acted on by different forces and to different ends—we have not thereby diminished, we have, on the contrary, enhanced the obligations of the Church. Precisely because Christian virtues do not lie within the province of the State to enforce, all the more is it the duty of the Church to enforce them by every means within her power. What she may not ask the State to do for her, all the more earnestly should she for that very reason strive to do for herself. If she had always done this fully, fearlessly, faithfully, self-denyingly, as she should have done; if all professing Christians had lived up, or even tried to live up to the teachings of Christ, we should have heard less than we now hear of these wild theories of State socialism, which, in their very wildness, often show us how hot and bitter the hearts of men may grow at the sight of suffering which Christianity might largely have relieved, and of sins and shame and sorrows which it might largely have diminished. This assuredly is true, and this, as it seems to me, is the one great lesson which the Church in our day has to learn—which she is, I believe, learning more and more—from this demand for the new socialism, whether it comes from those who love or from those who hate her and her Master.

And now I have said my say, very probably once more to my own hurt and to the great satisfaction of sundry critics, who I have no doubt will find in what I have said plenty to criticise. The subject of social and political ethics is a thorny one, in which many greater and better men than myself have entangled and thereby severely lacerated themselves ere now, and I am quite ready to accept this as my fate likewise. All that I really care for is to vindicate myself as one who, however unworthily, holds the office of a ruler and a teacher in the Christian Church, from the charges of "immorality" and "horrible" atheism which have so freely been brought against me in this matter. If, after this explanation, it should give any pleasure to my accusers, reverend and non-reverend, to repeat these accusations, they are perfectly welcome to do so. I venture to anticipate that if they are only commonly honest and do not once more willfully misquote and distort my words, the verdict of those at least who may have read this article will be one of acquittal.—*W. C. Peterborough.*
