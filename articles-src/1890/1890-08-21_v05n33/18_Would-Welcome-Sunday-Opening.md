A CURIOUS and interesting feature of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, on free days, is the presence at noon of workmen in overalls, and bearing all the marks of recent toil. They evidently come from the scene of building operations hard by, and their presence shows how eagerly working men would welcome the opening of the Museum on Sundays. The Sunday closing, by the way, is more and more a farce, for there is a constant increase in the number of Sunday passes issued to artists and their friends.—*The Sun*. [263-264]
