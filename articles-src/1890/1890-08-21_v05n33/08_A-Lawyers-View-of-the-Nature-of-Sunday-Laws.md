# A Lawyer’s View of the Nature of Sunday Laws.

IN his brief in the well-known King case, recently passed upon by the Supreme Court of Tennessee, Col. T. E. Richardson, attorney for the plaintiff in error, gave the following history of the law under which Mr. King was indicted:—

The only statutes on the subject will be found in the act of 1741, enacted by His Excellency, Gabriel Johnson, Esq., Governor, by and with the consent of His Majesty’s council, and General Assembly of the province of North Carolina; and is as follows:—

> Whereas, in well-regulated governments effectual care is always taken that the day set apart for public worship be observed and kept holy, all and every person or persons whatsoever shall, on the Lord’s day, commonly called Sunday, carefully apply themselves to the duties of religion and piety; and no tradesman, artificer, laborer, or other person whatsoever, shall upon the land or water, do or exercise any labor, business, or work of their ordinary callings—works of necessity and charity only, excepted—nor employ themselves either in hunting, fishing, or fowling, nor use any game, sport, or play, on the Lord’s day aforesaid, or any part thereof, upon pain that any person so offending, being of the age of fourteen years and upwards, shall forfeit and pay the sum of *one dollar and twenty-five cents.* All and every Justice and Justices of the Peace, within his or their respective counties, shall have full power and authority to convene before him or them, any person or persons who shall offend in any of the particulars before mentioned, in his or their hearing, or on other legal conviction of any such offense, and to impose the said fine or penalty for the. same. See laws of Tennessee, Scott’s Edition, Vol. 1, page 55.

This act was passed when the church was a part of the State—when there was a State religion. Its purpose was that Sunday should be kept holy. After the Revolution, this act seems to have been retained amongst the statutes of North Carolina, as well as incorporated in the laws of Tennessee. And in 1803, after the admission of Tennessee, as a State, into the Union, the Legislature passed an act entitled as follows:—

> An act more effectually to prevent the profanation of the Lord’s day, commonly called the Sabbath.

> Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, that if any merchant, artificer, tradesman, farmer, or any other person shall be guilty of doing or exercising any of the common avocations of life or causing or permitting the same to be done, by his, her, or their children or servants, acts of real necessity or charity excepted, on the Lord’s day, commonly called Sabbath, such person or persons on due conviction thereof before any Justice of the Peace within the county where such offense shall be committed, shall forfeit and pay the sum of three dollars, one-half to the person who shall sue for the same, the other half for the use of the county wherein such recovery may be had. This act was passed November 3, 1803. See laws of Tennessee, Scott’s Edition, Vol. 1, page 795; also Car. & Nich., Art. “Sabbath,” pages 638, 639.
Can there be any doubt that the act of 1741 was passed to favor and promote Christianity, and also the interests of the Church of England? then the religion and Church of the State. Is it not equally plain that the act of 1803 was passed to promote and give preference to the Christian religion? that it was passed to prevent the profanation of a day sacred to certain persons claiming to be members of the Christian Church, or of certain sects of Christians? This Court knows historically, if not judicially, of the wonderful revivals and wide-spread religious excitement in the year 1800. They created a deep and lasting impression upon the people. They prevailed most extensively throughout the States of Kentucky and Tennessee. They were conducted principally by the Presbyterians and Methodists, and the power and influence then obtained by the latter, are felt and seen to the present time.

That the act of 1803 was the result of those revivals, and passed in obedience to the behests of those churches and to conform to their religious views, no one can doubt. That the law was enacted to compel the observance of Sunday in conformity with their tenets, and to coerce the conscience of all persons who might differ with those sects, can be denied by no candid mind.

By those acts exclusive jurisdiction was given to Justices of the Peace, to try, and punish those who violate their provisions. For nearly a century no member of the Bar or Bench ever dreamed or held that the Circuit Courts of the State, had jurisdiction over the offense, as created by those acts.

For a half century or more after the passage of the act of 1803, it was regarded as the expression of earnest but fanatical zeal, and was allowed to fall into “innocuous desuetude.” It is the fit instrument of petty persecution, and has been seldom used, even by the most earnest of zealots.

To the credit of the Christian people of the State, it can be truly said, they have generally scorned to use such means of persecution or coercion. [247-248]

THE *Press,* of this city, suggests that when lightning struck the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one Saturday night, it was doubtless trying to open the door, so that working people could get into the museum on Sunday.

ON July 8, Senator Sherman presented in the Senate, petitions “numerously signed,” from Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Maine, Pennsylvania, New York, Iowa, Kansas, Vermont, and Michigan, praying for an acknowledgment of Almighty God, and the Christian religion, in the Constitution of the United States. The petitions were referred to the Committee on Judiciary.

JUDGE PENNYPACKER, of Philadelphia, in the case of an appeal from the justice court, by William R. Waldman, a barber, convicted and fined for Sunday-shaving, has affirmed the conviction with a long opinion, in which he bases his affirmance upon a law of 1794, which provides a fine of four dollars “for the performance of any worldly employment on the Lord’s day, commonly called Sunday.”

A CALIFORNIA paper, the *Citrograph, *notes the fact that Congress is being flooded with petitions for the closing of the Chicago World’s Fair, on Sunday, and says: “Should this be done, hundreds of thousands of workers will be ‘debarred from visiting the exposition. These Sunday-closing-petition signers can visit the exhibition any day they like; but the poor laborer, the workingman whose daily toil just suffices to keep his family going, must either be debarred from seeing the sights of the fair altogether or go on Sunday. We certainly hope Congress will totally ignore these petitions. To do otherwise will be to work a great hardship on the toilers of Chicago and vicinity.”

JUST now, Cardinal Gibbons is in bad odor with the *Mail and Express*, because he has said that he is in favor of opening museums and art galleries on Sunday, and that “apart from such religious exercises as each man’s conscience may impose upon him, the day should be given up to such recreations as contribute to the physical, mental, and moral benefit and enjoyment of the people.” “His position,” says the *Mail and Express,* “is thoroughly consistent with the practices of his church. . . . In Romanist countries Sunday is usually a day of shows, and general dissipation. The priests are satisfied, if the people go to mass in the morning, and to confession occasionally, to have them desecrate the Sabbath in any way they please.” The gentleman who presides over the destinies of the *Mail and Express, *would be satisfied with nothing less than the devoting of the whole of Sunday to religious exercise and spiritual meditation, saving that he would probably allow ample time, for those who could afford it, to enjoy the usual Sunday dinner.

THE Methodists of Utah have adopted a strong resolution warning the people of the United States against Mormonism, and declaring that the radical cure for what they call the new and dangerous form of Mormon rebellion, is to be looked for largely in the pending legislation in Congress. Commenting upon this a secular paper remarks, that in this they “appear to have fallen into an error in the language, at least, of their resolution. The resolution condemns Mormonism. But the Government of the United States has no war to wage against Mormonism. Apart from polygamy, the rights of the Mormon Church in this country do not differ from those of any other church.”

Now that the national Government has taken charge of the landing of immigrants at New York, a writer in the *Mail and Express* is anxious that Congress should regulate the time of departure of steamships from foreign ports, so that they should not arrive and disembark their passengers here on Sunday. He thinks that if the national Government would notify steamship companies that after a given date immigrants would not be allowed to land on Sunday, there would be no trouble in obtaining compliance with such a regulation. “This when accomplished,” he exclaims, “will be another point gained in favor of Sabbath observance.” How numerous, and how wonderful are the ways in which it is sought to commit Congress to Sunday legislation!

REFERRING to the fact that the Government has been for years granting money to various denominations, for the education of certain Indians, the *World *asks: “What business has the United States to engage in religious proselyting of the Indians, when its policy towards them for a hundred years has been robbery and extinction?” Only one answer can be given, namely, that the United States has no business whatever to engage in any such work. If the Government had let the religious education of the Indians alone altogether, it is highly probable that they would have received more and better religious instruction than they have received. In that case, men and women having a genuine missionary spirit would have been sent among them, who would have labored from love of souls, instead of love for Uncle Sam’s dollars. The greatest service that civil government can possibly do genuine Christianity, is to let religious instruction and religious questions severely alone.

THE Central American correspondent of the New York *Sun,* says: “A movement is going on in all the five republics to close the shops and stores on Sundays. The markets and establishments where provisions are sold, will be opened during a certain part of the day.” Although the Roman Catholic Church has been disestablished in Central America, yet, that is the form of religion quite universally espoused by the ruling classes; it is not likely to be difficult there, therefore, to obtain a formal observance of Sunday, enforced by law. To all who are experimentally acquainted, however, with Central American life and manners, such a “movement” presents itself as a grim sarcasm on the mock Christianity of this whole politico-legal hypocrisy.

THE *Christian Inquirer,* a Baptist paper of this city, says:—

> The Bible is the creed of Protestants. In this day when there is so much attention paid to confessions of faith, and so much said about a revision of creeds, the Church needs to swing back to the Bible as the supreme authority of doctrine and life, creed and conduct. Our battle will be shorter, sharper, more conclusive, and our victory surer and more glorious when we meet the hosts of infidelity, Romanism, and all sorts of falsehood and wicked ness, with the Bible only, in our hands. Our appeal must be to the Book! Every doctrine of men must be brought to the test of God’s word. If it be of God it will stand; if not, it will perish, and ought to perish.

That is good; the Bible ought to be in fact, as it is in theory, the creed of Protestants. But how about forcing “the creed of Protestants” upon everybody by the power of the State? And if Protestants are indeed willing to bring everything to the test of the Bible, and if they believe that everything that is of God will stand, why do they seek to have some so-called Christian institutions bolstered up by civil laws?
