"THE Sunday question," says the *Political World,* of London, "has cropped up in New South Wales, where it appears there are some pious people who think it wicked to indulge in innocent amusement and recreation on Sundays. Curiously enough an old imperial act of George III., making Sunday entertainments illegal, has been found by the courts to apply to the Colony. A well-known colonial theatrical manager has been fined for contravention of this moldy statute. But the victory gained in the law courts by the promoters of the proceedings, is after all, a doubtful advantage, seeing that this attempt to revive antiquated statutes was strongly condemned by the judges, who, indeed, expressed themselves in favor of a reform of the law so that the subject of a Sunday entertainment might be placed on a footing more in accordance with the general view of the present day."
