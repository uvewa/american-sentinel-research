How far this is a Christian country depends altogether on how far the principles of Christianity have become the principles of the people. An intelligent pagan observer, who should be told that this is a Christian country, would not form the most exalted notion of Christianity from what he might see. It is said that the Japanese Government recently sent a deputation to investigate the religious establishment of England, with a view to its introduction into Japan as a national religion. The commission reported adversely, chiefly on the ground that Christianity had not saved England from being a drunken nation. To incorporate the Christian religion with the government, and make it the established religion, does not make a Christian nation in the best sense. Christianity cannot be legislated into the world; it must be propagated by the "foolishness of preaching."—*Christian Advocate.*
