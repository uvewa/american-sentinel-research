A DISPATCH from Plainfield, New Jersey, says:—

> Determined to give the horses a weekly day of rest, local humanitarians have announced their intention of putting an effectual stop to Sunday driving. Plainfield has fifty miles of macadamized driveways, and every pleasant Sunday these are thronged with coaching parties. Many of these Sunday-driven horses are in use every day.

Whether these horses are to rest upon a purely secular basis or not, is not stated.
