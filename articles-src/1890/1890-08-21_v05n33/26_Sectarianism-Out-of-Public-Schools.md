ALL denominations have the right to sustain their own parochial schools, if they please, but should keep their sectarianism out of the common schools. Indeed, an intelligent friend to the Bible, and the civil rights of our country, will not urge the idea of scripture reading in our public schools.—*Judge Thomas Barlow.* [265]
