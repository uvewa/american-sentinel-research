As to the question of sectarianism in the public schools, the *Canada Presbyterian* suggests two solutions of this difficulty.

> The one is to read both versions, and the other that Catholics and Protestants should agree upon a book of selections. There is nothing impossible about either solution, if both parties were earnest and would yield a little. The matter is not made easier by the fact that many good men, and some good journals like the *Christian at Work,* are in favor of pure secularism. The Roman Catholics are a unit in favor of religious instruction.

The alternatives mentioned above are not offered by the Roman Catholics, nor would they be acceptable to them. The Romanists not only want the Douay version read, but they want it explained and taught. A book of selections perfunctorily read, would satisfy neither Romanists nor Protestants. The only practicable way is to devote the schools to secular instruction, and use the Church, the Sunday-school, and the home for religious instruction. There was religious instruction before there were public schools, and there ought to be religious instruction, even if the public schools are not devoted to religious instruction. If the Church and the home and the Sunday-school are wholly inadequate to instruct the young religiously, but must depend upon the public school, let them confess their failure, and we will see what can be done about it. Somehow we do not believe matters have come to such a pass yet.—*Christian at Work*.
