THE Supreme Court of Maine has lately been called upon to decide a case, in which was involved the horrible offense of "riding upon Sunday for exercise, and for no other purpose." The question was, whether such a startling act as this could be committed in Maine without violating the statute in relation to the observance of "the Lords day?" After wrestling with the question for a season, the Court set forth the following:—

> In O'Connell *vs* Lewiston, 65 Me. 34, and Davidson *vs* Portland, 69 id. 116, it was held that walking out in the open air upon the Sabbath for exercise is not a violation of the statute. In other jurisdictions, also, it has been held not to be unlawful to ride to a funeral (Horne *vs* Meakin, 115 Mass. 326); walking to prepare medicine for a sick child (Gorman *vs* Lowell, 117 id. 65); riding to visit a sick sister (Cronan *vs* Boston, 136 id. 384); traveling to visit a sick friend (Doyle *vs* Railroad Company 118 id., 195); a servant riding to prepare needful food for her employer (King *vs* Savage, 121 id. 303); a father riding to visit his two boys (McClary *vs* Lowell, 44 Vt. 116); walking for exercise (Hamilton *vs* Boston, 14 Allen 475); and walking partly for exercise and partly to make a social call (Barker *vs* Worcester, 139 Mass. 74). The statute was never intended as an arbitrary interference with the comfort and conduct of individuals, when necessary to the promotion of health, in walking or riding in the open air for exercise. The prohibition is against unnecessary walking or riding. As a general rule the jury, under proper instructions from the court, must determine this question from the circumstances presented to them.

What a travesty of every sound principle of law, of justice, and of government it is, to see the Supreme Court of a State gravely spending its time in interpreting a statute that by any possibility could involve such a question as this!
