THE Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor, which recently held at St. Louis, the largest convention ever gathered by any religious society, has been formally received into the *coterie* of religious bodies, associated together as the National Reform party. The *Christian Statesman*, hereafter, will devote a column in each issue to the Y. P. S. C. E. The Young Men's Christian Association is now the only organization of moment, established for a professedly moral purpose, which has not sold itself to politics and forsaken true religion, pure and undefiled, for the great deception in the religious world of this day.
