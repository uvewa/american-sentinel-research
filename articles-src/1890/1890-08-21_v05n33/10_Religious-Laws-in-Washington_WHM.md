THE American Sabbath Union has, for the past year, shown a very marked anxiety for the corporate morality of the city of Washington, and the District of Columbia. In the Sunday-rest Convention, held in Washington, the thirtieth of January, Rev. W. F. Crafts, while bewailing the lack of Sunday laws at the capital, spoke of the situation being "the same as it is in the far West,—Alaska, California, Idaho, and Arizona. In that strange fraternity Washington is left,— beautiful, beautiful Washington." For several weeks, in different churches of the city, Mr. Crafts continued to reiterate that refrain of "beautiful, beautiful Washington,—in that strange fraternity!"

This wail for the beautiful city associated with such castaways, degraded by such evil companionship, arose from the claim that Washington, in company with the States and Territories named, had no Sunday law.

It is true that the above named divisions of the United States are the only representatives of pure, civil, and religious liberty, undefiled, which this Union affords; but is it true that Washington and the District of Columbia are worthy to be named in that roll of honor? It is not. In Washington City, no hacks, or other vehicles for hire, are allowed to wait at their stands, or upon the streets, for custom on Sunday; no omnibuses or hacks may be left standing in the street, and no vehicle may be washed in the street on Sunday; barbers may not pursue their occupation, after one o'clock, p. M., without being liable to a fine of from twenty to forty dollars, *one-half to go to the informer;* no place of business for the sale of any article for profit, may be kept open on Sunday, except drug stores and undertakers' rooms; newspapers may not be carried on the streets after one, P. M., and no other articles hawked upon the streets during any portion of the day; no liquor can be sold, and all bars must be kept closed during the entire day and evening. (See Webb's digest, pages 372-4, 295.)

Reference to the same digest, page 310, shows the following: "It shall not be lawful for any person or persons to curse, swear, or make use of any profane language, etc., . . . under a penalty not exceeding ten dollars for each and every such offense." Arrests under this are frequent in Washington, the last noticed in the daily city papers, was on August 6.

The management of the public parks permits no games or recreation within their limits, on Sunday.

Besides all this, the District Commissioners have publicly declared, that as Blackstone has asserted Christianity to be part of the law of England, they had, in that dictum, sufficient authority upon which to arrest and prosecute Sunday baseball players in the District of Columbia;—consequently, by parity of reasoning, the Commissioners could arrest and prosecute for anything which they might decide to be an offense against the Christian religion.

Again, in addition, reference to the "Laws of the District of Columbia," page 136, shows that the Maryland law of 1723 was incorporated in the laws of the District; investigation shows that law never to have been repealed, and to be in force to-day. It is entitled "An act to punish blasphemers, swearers, drunkards, and Sabbath breakers," and is very complete in its enumeration of the different phases of these offenses, and thorough in its provisions; and still the Sabbath Union mourns over "beautiful, beautiful Washington," under the ban of a secular government. On the contrary, Washington and the District are under all these religious regulations, and what a bitter travesty on the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and its first Amendment, and the boasted enlightenment of the American people is the presence of such laws on the statute books, and among the ordinances of the capital city of the Nation.

What can be said for the intelligence, or Christianity of those, who, instead of striving to have them expunged from the records, would add to that brood from the Dark Ages?W. H. M.
