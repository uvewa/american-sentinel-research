THERE is no question as to the fact that the Bible ought to be taught. But the question does arise, where shall it be taught? and by whom?

The place where to teach is not so material, as the kind of doctrine or principles taught. The Bible is committed to faithful men to teach and preach, and to be faithful they must have faith; for how can a person teach that of which he has no well defined knowledge? God's book addresses itself to the spiritual understanding of men. Hence, a person must be spiritually minded, and in possession of the divine spirit, to teach spiritual things, for the natural man understandeth not the things of God, for they are spiritually discerned.

Now, as the State and Government are not spiritual, nor indeed can be, they cannot teach, or cause to be taught, spiritual things, for as they are not spiritual they cannot tell when spiritual things are taught; and are therefore liable to be grossly imposed upon by pretenders. And forcing spiritual men and women to unwillingly submit to the most flagrant errors in religious teaching, would destroy religion. Patent political preaching is not the kind of which God approves. God always has chosen, and always will choose, his own standard bearers.

Public schools, in many instances, are supplied with irreligious teachers, and they are not proper persons to read to pupils, or instruct them, out of the Bible. God put his law in the hands of Aaron in the beginning, and farther on, in the hands of the prophets, and lastly, Jesus Christ put the work into the hands of the newly-made church, and sent them out to preach to, and disciple all nations, encouraged by the words, "I am with you alway."

Christianity is a work of God in the soul, and a matter of conscience between the individual and his God; and no man has a right to step in and tell me what I shall believe, or how and when I shall worship. The Baptist, the Jew, and Adventist have a right to keep the seventh day or any other day if that is their sincere conviction. I have a right to keep every day in the week if I like, or no day at all, so long as I do not interfere with the social, moral, and religious rights of others. God does not compel men to be religious; does not force men to believe; they have a right of choice; they can doubt everything if they like; they make their choice, and must take the consequences of that choice.

I am opposed to the Blair bill, because it seeks to improve upon God's plan of dealing with men. It assumes that God is incompetent to control men under his system of government. And Mr. Blair volunteers to assist the Almighty in making people religious, if he can get Congress to help him. He had better keep his hands off the holy ark, for there is death behind it. Why will men undertake to lumber up Congress with a work that belongs exclusively to the Church and to individual conscience?

I am opposed to the Sunday-rest bill, because it takes away the right of the church as a religious organization; prostitutes its sanctity, and turns religion over to a Christless formality, and institutes a new machine for the manufacture of hypocrites, by compelling men to appear to be what they are not, and compelling men to subscribe to that which they do not believe, and will not practice.R. M. CULVER.
