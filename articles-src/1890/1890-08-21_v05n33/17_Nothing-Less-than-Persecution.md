COMMENTING editorially on the same case, that of R. M. King, the Chicago *Tribune* says:—

> Mr. King has not only the National Religious Liberty Association at his back, but the whole body of Adventists, who observe the seventh day as their Sunday, and are tenacious of their rights and their faith. They claim the right under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights of the State, to work upon Sunday as they do upon every other day of the week. As Mr. King himself is an Adventist, and his prosecutors and defenders are Christian organizations, the contest is confined to religious bodies, but the whole country will nevertheless watch the case with great interest, as it involves a question which has been largely discussed among the people but has not before engaged the attention of the national Supreme Court. So long as the labor of the Adventists on Sunday does not interfere with the rights of the Mosaic and Puritanic people on the same day, the prosecution of them seems neither more nor less than persecution.

This shows how fair-minded men regard Sunday laws, and especially their enforcement against those who observe another day. The observance or non-observance of a day should, however, make no difference, since it is neither the right nor the duty of the State to enforce upon anybody any religious observance.
