"RUSSIA," says the *Missionary Herald*, "is guilty of the most flagrant denial of the rights of conscience, and of religious liberty. It is said that there are now in the common prison of Witepsk, several men and women of high moral character, whose only offense is that they have spoken in quiet ways of the gospel truths which they have themselves received.

After confinement of about six months, their trial was to take place in June, with the probable result of their being deprived of property rights, and also sentenced to long imprisonment or banishment to Siberia. No hand, save that of the Almighty, seems able to put a stop to these atrocities."
