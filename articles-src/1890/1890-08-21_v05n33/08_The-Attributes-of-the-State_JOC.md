THERE is considerable difference between a *nation* and a *State.* A nation is an aggregation of people, who speak the same language, have the same characteristics, and follow the same customs. A *State* is a political organization of the inhabitants of a certain territory, formed by the people for their mutual protection against violence and injustice. A whole nation may form a single State, but this is seldom the case, as is shown from the divided governments of the Spanish, French, German, English, and other nations. National lines are absolute, and are determined by the circumstances of birth and language. A State exists by the will of those who form it, and its limits are not confined to conditions of nature, such as those of birth and language, since the representatives of many nations may combine to form a State. A nation is the product of nature, while a State is an artificial arrangement to meet existing circumstances, and is therefore liable to change.

A nation, in the state of nature, gives no security to the weak against violence and oppression from the strong. Without a civil government, such as is afforded by the State, anarchy would always prevail, and thus, each would do as he pleased, without regard to the rights of others. Might would be right, and the strong would always prevail, to the injury of the weak. This has been abundantly demonstrated in the history of aboriginal nations, from the remotest times. Civil government, then, is or should be, a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, to protect the person and property of all alike; to compel all to satisfy their wants from the products of their industry, rather than by plunder, and to settle their differences by arbitration, rather than by brute force.

In other words, civil government is organized to do for the members of a community, either singly or collectively, what they are unable to do for themselves without the co-operation of public authority. While this leaves the great part of human affairs, as they should be in any free government, to individual enterprise, there are always public measures, such as negotiations with foreign powers, the raising and maintenance of military forces, and the collecting of taxes with which to provide for expenses for the public good, which must be left to the domain of governmental power, because if left to the people promiscuously, misunderstanding and confusion would ensue, which would at once destroy the peace of the community.

The State cannot, however, do everything simply because it has been thus clothed with power. The State owes all that it is to the people who have created it, and defined its powers. It may be indeed that the powers of a State have not been limited at all by the people who have created it. But there is a Power yet above both State and people, who has set a limit to the powers of the State. The God of heaven has separated, from any jurisdiction or cognizance of the State, the duties and obligations which men owe to him. Man did not need a civil government to define moral duties, because such knowledge was in his possession before the formation of the civil government. And if man had acted according to this knowledge, the necessity for civil government never would have existed. Yet when man departed from the right use of this knowledge, and thus made it necessary that civil government should exist, even then it was not necessary to have a State compact to enforce the authority of Heaven, by punishing infractions of the divine law; for the Author of that law proclaimed his own ability to administer his own government, and punish for the violation of his statutes. "To me belongeth vengeance and recompense.... The Lord shall judge his people." Deut. 32:35, 36. The beings whom the State governs, are, therefore, subject to a moral law which is higher than any human law.

Then what is the necessity for a civil government? Simply to regulate the civil relations of those who are citizens of the State, and by whose consent it governs. But the State being the creature of the citizens, it has no right to command them in matters which would contravene the higher law to which they are amenable, since the Author of that law is above both the citizen and the State. In truth, the State can have no more power over the things of the *moral* law, which emanates from Jehovah, than it has over physical laws, since both of these have the same origin, and are alike unchangeable.

Some may object that this method of reasoning could not apply in countries where the patriarchal theory of government obtains. But that does not prove the reasoning incorrect. The rule followed in those countries where the oldest child is made a ruler of the nation, whether qualified or not, is absurd, and cannot be sustained either in reason or the Bible. Jacob was not the eldest son of Isaac, nor Judah of Jacob, nor David of Jesse, nor Solomon of David. Those passages in the New Testament, which describe government as an ordinance of God, and require subjection to it on that account, were written to a people who did not live under an hereditary government. The Roman emperors were magistrates supported by the army. None of them pretended to rule by right of birth. Nero, whom Paul exhorted the Christians in Rome to obey, was a usurper by the murderous intrigues of wicked and adulterous women. Tiberius also, whose authority Christ recognized by commanding that tribute should be given him, ruled by virtue of the will of Augustus, and the power of the army, "having crept darkly into it by the intrigues of a wife, and by adoption from a superannuated prince."

English kings, too, have ruled in defiance of the patriarchal theory, as will be seen by the history of that nation during the reign of Henry I., Stephen, John, Henry IV., Henry V., Henry VI., Richard III., and others. Henry VIII., far from believing in the divine right of kings, obtained an act of Parliament giving him power to leave the crown by will, and took advantage of that power, to the prejudice of the royal family of Scotland. Edward VI. assumed a similar power, with the approbation of some of the most eminent reformers. Elizabeth induced Parliament to pass a law giving power to the reigning sovereign, with the assent of the estates of the realm, to alter the succession.

These instances show conclusively, that none of those sovereigns mentioned, believed in the hereditary rule in government. Sometimes, indeed, as in the case of James, who, though an heir of William the Conqueror, was excluded from the throne by the testament of Henry VIII., it was maintained that birth confers a right to the throne which it is impossible for law to set aside. But a republican form of government has always been so obviously the best suited to man's civil necessities, that monarchies have been constantly yielding to its influences, until many of them have become so limited that little besides the outward signs of royalty remains, and the will of the people predominates.
