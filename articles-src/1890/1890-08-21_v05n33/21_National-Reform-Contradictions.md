ABOUT a year ago, Rev. J. M. Foster, one of the National Reform Secretaries, published an article in the *Christian Statesman,* in which, referring to the Jeffersonian theory of government, he said:—

> That theory is dead and buried long ago. There is only one theory accepted among political philosophers now: "There is no power but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God."

As every American knows, the Jeffersonian theory of government is that set forth in the Declaration of Independence, that governments are for the purpose of securing human rights, and that they derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, that is, from the people. This, Mr. Foster denies in the above quotation; but in the *Christian Statesman,* of June 5, Rev. R. C. Wylie, another National Reform Secretary, has an article in the form of a catechism, in which he says:—

> *Question.* What is the origin of that authority possessed by the Government to enact and enforce law?

> *Answer.* The authority possessed by the Government to enact and enforce law, is derived directly from the people.
This is sound doctrine, but it is not genuine National Reform doctrine; it is simply a National Reform concession to the American idea of government.
