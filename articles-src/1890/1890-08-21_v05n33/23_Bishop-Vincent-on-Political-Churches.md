BISHOP VINCENT is reported as having said, in a late address at Chautauqua:—

> I do not believe that the church of to-morrow ought to be a political church. When the Methodist Episcopal Church, which I humbly represent, begins a political career, urges the passage of certain laws and measures which will be for her special advantage, and hers alone, I am done with that church, and am her bitterest enemy.

The Bishop's first sentence lays down a general principle; in his second, he applies it to his personal relation to the denomination of which he is a member; and in doing so he emphasizes his antagonism to a political church as a whole and in principle.

The Bishop is right. As he is a follower of Christ and a lover of true religion, so is he a bitter enemy of political hypocrisy and legal formality.

No clearer and more certain evidence can be found, and no truer general criterion laid down, of the purity of a man's religion, than the mutual enmity which exists between him and a political church.
