THE State Secretary of the Sunday Union, for Iowa, has undertaken the publication of an eight page monthly, devoted solely, as it says, to the question, "Shall we protect the Christian Sabbath, or surrender it to the organized opposition."

That the *Pearl of Days* has now two coadjutors, one in the middle West, and another on the Pacific coast, the latter edited by the State Secretary of the Sunday Union, for California, marks the steady growth of the movement to accomplish religious legislation; and should stimulate to more faithful effort those who foresee the final outcome; that the truth of this question may be presented before the people while their minds are still free to consider it, and while there is still opportunity for full and untrammeled discussion.
