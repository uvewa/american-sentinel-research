PRINCIPLES are fundamental truths. In the Declaration of Independence we have this grand principle: "All men are created equal, and are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty," etc. The leading principle of the Bible is, that our first duty, hence our first right, is to love and worship God unmolested. This is religious liberty. The beauty of a principle is, that nothing but truth will fit it. Hence principles are touch-stones which distinguish the true from the false.—*M. E. Steward, A. M., in Southern Sentinel.*
