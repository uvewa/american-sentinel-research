"SOME Christians serve God so tremendously on Sunday," says Doctor Talmage, "that they are cross and crabbed all the week. Doing too many things on Sunday, they do nothing well all the rest of the week."

And the Doctor might have added truthfully that as a class such "Christians" are in favor of compelling everybody else to "serve God" just as they do, at least so far as Sunday is concerned. They are generally those who believe that the sum of all religion, worth having, is in Sunday keeping.
