DR. DAVID McALLISTER seems to think that religion depends upon the statutes of States and the edicts of empires. In this, he joins in opinion with the most rabid of atheists and anarchists who constantly charge religionists with being the dupes of power exercised through State authority.

The Emperor Constantine made Christianity the religion of the Roman Empire, and to this fact, many unbelievers in Christianity attribute its extraordinary growth. The very opposite of this is more probably the truth. Gibbon shows very plainly that Constantine himself, vacillated between Christianity and the old State religion of Rome almost to the end of his days, just as politicians seeking support from contending factions now do, when doubtful as to which party is most likely to prevail. It is often a fine stroke of political policy, for an aspirant for power and fame, to espouse what outwardly appears to be the weaker party in a State, and thus connect his name with its rise, and growth into full power and control. The statesman who has the shrewdness to fall in with the rising tide of public sentiment, at the proper moment, is sure to reap power and emoluments in the end.

Primitive Christianity was the religion of the poor fishermen of Galilee; and while their hearts were warmed, their hopes inspired, and their enthusiasm enkindled by it, it was laughed about and scoffed at, by the Scribes, the Pharisees, and the fashionable people of the time.

In Rome, Christianity took root among the workingmen—the poor and the lowly, in the cities—as radical reforms generally do. And its methods were so quiet, and its early adherents so peaceful, that, to use the words of Gibbon, it "gently insinuated itself into the minds of men, grew up in silence and obscurity, derived new vigor from opposition, and finally erected the banner of the cross on the ruins of the capitol."

In its primitive purity, Christianity had no use for the State as a means of propaganda. It grew and spread through the cities in spite of the State, and State religions, which, sooner or later, were always found to be its deadly enemies.

Why should the aid of the politician be invoked, to strengthen and support a movement having for its object the *reform* of public opinion, while *his* object as a general rule, is to quietly *float* with popular opinion *as it is?* Convince him that you have the votes to carry him along, and he is with you. Fail to do this, and he is in your way.

No religion ever remained pure and true to humanity, that sought to carry forward its propaganda by means of political strategem, political power, and political spoils.

The idea that the State can make *itself *moral, by the formula of "Be it enacted," is to invoke from the masses of the people, a moral force which, by hypothesis, does not exist among them; and it is as absurd, under our theory of popular government, as the attempt of a man to lift himself by the straps of his boots.

First plant the moral force in the hearts and minds of the masses—get them in love with the true, the beautiful, and the good; let them come to hate inequality of rights, and despise slavery in all its myriad forms; let them see the beauty of truth and the economy of righteousness; and there will be no occasion for wrangling as to what religion the "State" should believe in.

The truth is, the State, as such, does not and cannot believe in anything. A law book cannot think or feel, and can neither do right nor wrong. When a king is imagined to be the State, it might be presumed to have a moral character, or more probably, an immoral character. But when the State becomes the concrete result of the conflicting opinions and passions of sixty-five millions of people—a mere compromise, reflecting the opinions of no one individual,—it cannot be said to have a moral character, or a religious belief.

The Rev. R. M. Somerville evidently is not satisfied with the proposition to simply print the name of God in the Constitution. He wants Christ recognized as a politician also, to the extent of having his name mixed up with the names of the lawyers that figure so largely in our old musty law books. It is the old antiquated notion of religious *things* instead of religious men. Make the *things* sacred in order that they may make *us* pious! Does it not smack of image worship and idolatry?

When will the Church learn that moral force can be transmitted only by the tender cords of sympathy and love? Does not all experience prove that the State is incompetent *to force* men to love and believe, by means of policemen, courts, and armies?

Physical force is available to control *action* only. The attempt, through physical force, to make men love one another, is to make them hate and despise one another.

Let the fashionable churches come down to the level of the working people, as the early Christians did, and show their sympathy for the poor and lowly—not so much by alms-giving and begging as by showing them what their *rights* are, as well as their errors; by teaching them that no man has the right to acquire wealth through the power of the State—that the State can have no wealth to give to some without first taking it from others—that the man who sells his vote for money, is selling, not only *his* rights, but *other* people's rights; by teaching consistent, genuine righteousness all 'round, and everywhere, in high places and low, in public and private relations; let all this be proclaimed as God's law, and I venture to say more sympathy will be excited, more minds will be awakened and more churches will be filled, than would result from printing the word God in all the law books and school books, or by chalking his name all over creation by State authority.
