# A Scrap of History.

IN the Convention of the Sunday Union, held in Washington last winter, Mr. Crafts said that in the event of the passage of the Breckinridge Sunday Bill for the District of Columbia, a “law-and-order league” would undoubtedly be established to aid in its enforcement. Dyer and Obion Counties, in Tennessee, where Sunday prosecutions are now going on, had forestalled the Sunday Union, in this particular, as will be seen, by the following extract from the cross-examination of a witness for the prosecution, in the case of *The State of Tennessee v. R. M. King*, lately tried before Judge Swiggart:—

> *Question.*—You say this plowing of his, on that day, created a determination with some, that it would be prosecuted?

> *Answer*—Yes, sir,—ought to be.
> *Question*—Who formed that determination?
> *Answer*—Well, sir, there were several parties; previous
> *Question—*Name them.
> *Answer*—I want to tell you how I got the names, if you will let me.
> *Question—*Just give the names.
> *Answer*—Mr. Dobbins, Mr. Will Wright, and perhaps Mr. Frank Pardue (I am not certain), and Mr. W. R. King, and some others that I don’t know that I could name just now.
> *Question*—Of what church are you a member?
> *Answer*—Methodist Church.
> *Question*—Have you named all the. parties that you remember?
> *Answer—*Yes, sir, that is all,—all I could name just now.
> *Question—*At or before this time, had there been a combination, or a written agreement entered into, between you and the parties that you have named, that you would prosecute all violations of Sunday laws?
> *Answer*—Yes, sir, there had.
> *Question*—Have you ever had anybody else indicted or arrested, or charged, except Seventh-day Adventists?
Objected to.

> *Colonel Richardson*—I am asking this, with a view to show the *animus* of these witnesses, and their feelings against this particular man. I expect to show why Mr. Cole (as he said they had) entered into a compact to prosecute all the parties who violated the Sunday laws. I expect to prove by Mr. Cole, that divers parties (and, if not by him, by others) who are not Seventh-day Adventists, cut wheat and did all sorts of work on the Sabbath, desecrating it generally, and that nobody has been prosecuted or interfered with, except this remnant of Israel. (Hisses.)

> *Court*—Ask him if he has any feeling against this defendant, if you want to. I sustain the objection. (Defendant excepts. )
A PACKAGE of petitions from Michigan, has been received in Washington, by the secretary of the National Religions Liberty Association, with a note attached which reads as follows:—

> I circulated this petition in my school district. All signed it.

Such thorough work as this, is encouraging, especially when it is remembered that all these are enabled, by the leaflet, “My reasons for signing the petition against religious legislation,” which they receive, to understand more fully and defend the position which they have taken.

[167-168]

IT is clear that the chief effect of the late decision of the Supreme Court on the liquor question, will he to make the question of prohibition a national question only.

Now that prohibition has become indeed a national question let it be made strictly a political, and not a religious nor yet a religio-political, issue. Let the National Prohibition platform be stripped of its religious, National Reform features, and let it declare for prohibition straight, for prohibition only. Then it ought to win, and THE AMERICAN SENTINEL will do all it can to help it win. But so long as that platform retains its National Reform head, its religious body, and its Sunday tail, THE AMERICAN SENTINEL will be uncompromisingly opposed to it “teeth and toe nail.”

THE *Mail and Express* takes Doctor Talmage severely to task for allowing himself to be interviewed, for publication in a Sunday newspaper. But the *Mail and Express* recommends its own Saturday evening’s issue for reading on Sunday; and it is certain that in the Talmage interview there was nothing as dull and vapid as the matter of the *Mail and Express *habitually is; and it is likewise certain that there is not a Sunday paper in New York City which does not furnish much better reading than does the Saturday issue, or any other issue, of the *Mail and Express.*

LAST fall, Rev. N. R. Johnston, of Oakland, California, was appointed a member of a committee to organize local Sunday Unions in that State. In commenting upon this fact we incidentally remarked that it was certainly fit that he should be a member of the committee, since, though socially a very worthy man, his religious views were such that he could not see why if a theocracy was good for the Jews it would not be equally good for us; nor why if it was right anciently to put men to death for Sabbath breaking, it would not be the proper thing to do now. In short, we said that he was unable to distinguish between a divinely-established theocracy and a man-made counterfeit of a divine theocracy. Mr. Johnston felt grieved at this, and complained, both privately and publicly, that we had misrepresented him. Till now we have remained silent under the charge, having in our removal to this city mislaid the evidence of the truth of that which we said. However, a recent article in the *Christian Statesman,* from Mr. Johnston’s pen, has furnished abundant evidence that we stated the case none too strongly; and in this, and the preceding number of THE SENTINEL, under the heading, “How Far They Propose to Carry It,” this evidence is given. Mr. Johnston may not mean all that he says; in fact, we have often thought that he was better than his theory; but he should not find fault when people take him just as he says, especially when he expresses his sentiments in carefully written articles for publication.

THE twenty-fifth anniversary of the National Temperance Society was held in Broadway Tabernacle, this city, Tuesday May 13. The exercises were well attended, especially in the evening when the great building was crowded. The exercises throughout were more like those of a genuine temperance association than any which we have seen for many a day. In fact a genuine temperance organization is just what this Society is. The strong pleas that were made for the restoration of the real, good old temperance meetings and work, in which the effort should be to save men and build up strong individual characters, were in marked and refreshing contrast with the political harangues, the self-glorification, and the mutual admiration speeches of organizations labeled “Christian Temperance.” THE AMERICAN SENTINEL heartily wishes the National Temperance Society the most unbounded success.

A DISPATCH gives the information that the Governor of California has “pardoned an innocent man.” That is a most singular proceeding, though it is not the first time that it has been attempted by executives in the States. Pardon necessarily implies guilt. If the man was innocent, of what then could he have possibly been pardoned? It will be said that the man had been convicted and sentenced by the State, though innocent, and in order to release him it was necessary to pardon him. Not at all. There is no place for pardon in the case. When the State convicted a man who was innocent, then the State did wrong. And when the State discovered that it had done the wrong, even though it were mistakenly and unintentionally, the only proper thing to do was to issue a public apology, and a proclamation fully exonerating the innocent man who had suffered such grievous injury. To offer a pardon in such a case is only to add insult to injury. To offer a pardon in such a case is both to charge and to convict of the crime of which it is proposed to pardon the man. And for a man to accept pardon in such a case is to confess guilt. It would be well for governors at such times to bear in mind what justice is, and to be just before they undertake to be generous. It is impossible to pardon an innocent man.

IN a recent speech at Cooper Union, Dr. Mc Glynn said:—

> We have long since got past the idea of paternal government. We do not believe in a Government that is to feed people till old age with a spoon. We believe in self-government, especially in political matters, and I am free to say that I believe in a great deal of self-government in the Church as well as in the State. The average American must feel his blood boil with indignation at this notion of nursing and coddling the working men and women, being kind to the beggars, taking interest in their moral and spiritual as well as their material welfare.

The Doctor is quite right except in the statement that we have “got past the idea of paternal government.” That idea is the bed-rock principle of Romanism, of Mormonism, of Nationalism, and of National Reformism, and as a Nation we are badly afflicted with all of these isms. Indeed paternalism seems to be in the very air. It has been well said, however, that a paternal government is an infernal government for the reason that it must of necessity trench upon the most sacred rights of the individual. The paternal idea of government is that the State decides what is best for the individual, and then undertakes to see that he gets it, whether he wants it or not.

THE *Dial*, of Oakland, California, is striking some heavy blows against Sunday laws, and all religious legislation. We admire its talent but we cannot fully indorse all that it says, for the reason that it does not properly distinguish between Christianity and much of that which claims to be Christianity. Sunday laws are anti-Christian, and those who advocate them are, though it may be unwittingly, the enemies of the truth as it is in Jesus Christ. The *Dial* should recognize the fact that it is not Christianity but the lack of it which leads the Church to seek the aid of the civil power to support her institutions. Christianity is able, not only to stand alone, but to flourish under persecution. Indeed so true is this that it has been said that “the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church.” [169]
