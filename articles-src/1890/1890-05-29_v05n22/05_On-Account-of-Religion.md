# On Account of Religion.

*America* says that in 1885 Foster North, of Kewanee, Illinois, was expelled from the State University of Illinois, for refusing to attend religious exercises in the chapel, and that now, on the strength of the Wisconsin decision, he has entered suit to have himself re-instated as a student. We wonder that he did not enter such suit long ago; it certainly was proper for him to do so the very day he was expelled. The Constitution of Illinois declares that, “The free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination, shall forever be guaranteed; and no person shall be denied any civil or political right, privilege or capacity, on account of his religious opinions;” and that, “No person shall be required to attend or support any minister, or place of worship against his consent, nor shall any preference be given by law, to any [165] religious denomination, or mode of worship.” And when the authorities of the University expelled that student for that cause, they certainly put themselves above the Constitution. For, the officers of the State University are State authorities; their action would be the action of the State; and for them to compel attendance on religious exercises is certainly to require attendance at a place of worship; and to expel a student for not attending, was certainly to deny him a civil privilege on account of his religious opinions. All the people of Illinois are interested in this case, and we hope that they will see it through. We hope further to see the rights of that student vindicated by the Supreme Court of that State.
