THE bill which recently passed the Senate forbidding the sale of intoxicating liquors in the District of Columbia on Sunday, was for a time prevented from passing, by Senator Blair, who desired to have it amended. Finally, however, Mr. Blair withdrew his objection to its passage, saying:—

> This particular bill, it seems to be thought, is very good in the way of spoon-victuals, and I do not feel inclined to be an obstacle to the enactment of whatsoever good there may be in it into a law. *It is well to provide for the observance of the Sabbath.*

And so it appears that Senator Blair agrees with us that Sunday-closing laws are in the interests, not of temperance, but of Sunday observance. That bill ought to be killed, and we hope the House of Representatives will do it.
