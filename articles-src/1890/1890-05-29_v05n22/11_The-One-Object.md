AT the Garnett, Kansas, Sabbath-rest Convention, held in March, there was noticeable a general diversity of opinion on almost every point brought up except one. Some observed Sunday, because the fourth commandment is binding. Others observed it because of the resurrection of Christ and the completion of redemption on that day. Some believed it to be verily the seventh day from creation; while another had no less than a half dozen reasons for changing to the first day. Some believed in keeping the Sabbath according to the most strict laws of the Puritans; while another believed in an entirely different manner of Sabbath observance.

Thus it was all through the Convention on all points except the one great object, —that of having a law to enforce the observance of the day. All arguments were made for this one purpose. It mattered not though the reasons given were contrary the one to the other, they would [174] make the final conclusion point to the enactment and enforcement of a Sunday law, and that would seem to harmonize every thought.

The indications were that they think the Lord is not able to pass sentence and execute judgments against the violators of his law, and has consequently passed it over into their hands, for them to look after and enforce. So now they seem to think it incumbent on them to bring to pass some means whereby they can punish the transgressors of God's law (according to their interpretation of his law), and clear themselves of this great responsibility.

It is not surprising that they should come to such a conclusion, when we remember that one of their men has said, "In this work we are undertaking for the Sabbath, we are the representatives of God." It is the principle upon which the Papacy was built; and the Papacy was only the natural outgrowth of the principle. The establishment of this principle is their object.OSCAR HILL.
