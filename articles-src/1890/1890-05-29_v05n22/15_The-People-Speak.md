THE following editorial report from the daily *Bodie Miner*, of California, is worth reprinting here. It has the right ring and a good deal of it:—

Last Tuesday J. H. Cook and J. A. Wheeler of the National Religious Liberty Association, arrived in Bodie. These gentlemen are travelling through Eastern California and Western Nevada, obtaining signatures to petitions to Congress asking that body to refrain from any legislation whatever looking to a union of Church and State in the Government of the United States. Considering that we have got along very comfortably, very happily, and very prosperously for over a hundred years without any such cranky nonsense, no sensible man thinks there is any sense in starting it now. The movement which Mr. Cook and Mr. Wheeler are urging is a simultaneous one in every State and Territory in the Union, agents canvassing everywhere for signatures to Congress to let the Constitution remain as it is so far as regards religion or religious tests. Returns of signatures to Washington are made weekly. These gentlemen commenced canvassing for names as soon as they arrived in town, and about every lady and gentleman who understood the matter readily signed the petition.

A mass-meeting was held in Miners' Union Hall on Thursday evening. The meeting was called to order by Watkin Morgan. Orlando E. Jones was selected for Chairman, Watkin Morgan acting as secretary.

Chairman Jones read the Blair Sunday-rest Bill and the Joint Resolution proposing to establish religion in our public schools. Mr. Jones then proceeded, in his customary clear and perspicacious style, to point out the absurdity of legislating on those subjects at all. We are happy, contented, prosperous, rich, and the boss of the world; let us remain so.

F. P. Willard made a very neat and telling little speech in support of the petition, and was heartily applauded throughout.

Harvey Boone, while declining to make any remarks, heartily indorsed the petition and the object of the meeting.

J. H. Cook, who is thoroughly familiar with the entire subject, explained it very lucidly, after which the following resolutions were presented and read:—

> *Resolved,* That we, the people of Bodie, Mono County, California, in mass-meeting assembled, are steadfastly opposed to the adoption by Congress of the United States of the joint resolutions introduced in the Senate by Senator Blair, proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, respecting the establishment of religion and free public schools. That we are opposed to the passage by Congress of the Blair Sunday-rest Bill, and to its kindred measure introduced by Mr. Breckinridge, of Kentucky, and to all other legislation looking to the establishment of any system of religion by the Nation, or by any State; or restricting the right of any citizen to engage in any legitimate, lawful pursuits on any day of the week.

> *Resolved,* That the first section of the joint resolution for the amendment of the Constitution respecting an establishment of religion and free public schools, which reads as follows: "No State shall make any law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," is not designed to guard the rights of the several States, but to muzzle them, and thus center the power of legislation on the subject of religion for the several States, in the national Legislature.
> *Resolved,* That article second of said joint resolution which proposes to establish and maintain a system of free public schools in which are taught the fundamental principles of the Christian religion, is destructive of the principles of religious and civil liberty, and is wholly un-American in its inception, and deserves the universal condemnation of every American citizen.
> *Resolved,* That the Blair Sunday-rest Bill is wholly a religious bill. Its passage would be religious legislation, therefore, is in conflict with the first amendment. "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." That it is in conflict with the words of Christ, "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's." That it places a high penalty of crime on conduct not essentially criminal. That it is designedly loose in its wording, "labor to the disturbance of others," giving every advantage in law to any religious bigot who may chance to have had his mental equilibrium disturbed by Sunday labor, subjecting the offending party to a fine from $10 to $1000; also the premium bid for any one to spy out persons who may have labored and received pay for said labor, in conflict with said law; to bring suit in his own name, and for his own use, and recover said money; all of which speak plainly of the religious and intolerant character of the said bill; that they call loudly on every American citizen to come to the rescue and demand the preservation of the Constitution, as it now is, with all its safeguard against any religious legislation, and protection alike equally to all.
After the reading, N. B. Ward moved that the resolution be adopted. Carried, the vote being unanimous.

Those present were then invited to sign the petition, which all did with alacrity.

Friday morning, Messrs. Cook and Wheeler, having performed a good work in Mono County, left for Hawthorne, and will continue their labors to Candelaria, and down through Inyo. [175-176]
