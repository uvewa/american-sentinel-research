THE *Sabbath Advocate,* of Stanberry, Missouri, says that "the present tendency on the part of the people of this Nation is to put down everything that tends to unite Church and State, and consequently Mr. Blair is having poor success in his Sunday legislation. Too vividly does the past come up before us to tolerate such without a struggle. We say down with everything of such tendencies. Christianity can stand without a union with the State." If the editor of the *Advocate* would take the *Congressional Record* and note carefully the number of petitions presented both in the Senate and House in favor of a national Sunday law he would not feel quite so confident as he seems to that Mr. Blair may not after all be ultimately successful in his efforts to secure religious legislation. The friends of a national Sunday law are making a "still hunt," but they are doing effective work, and if the advocates of religious liberty suppose that there is no danger they are simply deceiving themselves. But what the *Advocate *says illustrates the situation exactly. The great danger to religious liberty in this country is due in a large measure to the indifference of the people. The great majority think that there is, and can be no danger; and at least a large minority care not a straw whose liberty is infringed so long as *they* are not affected. They fail to realize that the only safety for any class is in *jealously guarding the rights of all alike.*
