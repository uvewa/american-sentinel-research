# The Flaw.

THE object of the National Reform Association is stated to be “the maintenance of the existing Christian features of our national life. The Association is opposed to union of Church and State, on the one hand, and the secularized or atheistic State, on the other hand.”

The flaw in this very subtle statement, is in the last sentence. The supposition that the individuals who compose a secular State or Government, are necessarily atheists, is absurd. Neither is a secular State an atheistic State; nor a secular condition necessarily an atheistic condition. Every man, so long as he exists in this world and accepts its social and political responsibilities, must be a part of secular Government and a secular State. He may profess Christianity or atheism, still his secular, worldly duties to his fellow-man remain unaltered. Nations and States are secular and transitory; they are not of the spiritual world or eternal. Neither the District of Columbia, nor the State of Pennsylvania, nor the United States of America will rise in the resurrection. Neither the passage of Sunday laws, nor the insertion of the name of God in the Constitution can give eternal life to a legal fiction, or assure to it any such possibility.

Christianity or atheism can only be attributed to individuals, governmental units, and not to the composite body politic. Were that not the case, all would be lost, for, so long as there is an unrepented sin, the sinner is lost. Therefore, if Christianity or atheism can be attributed to the State, so long as there is one unrepentant sinner, the State is lost. Are the National Reformers willing to accept the inevitable logic of their position?

Let us analyze that sentence: “The Association is opposed to union of Church and State, on one hand, and the secularized and atheistic State, on the other hand.” The construction shows the opposition to be expressed against two things —“union of Church and State,” and a “secularized or atheistic State.” The expressions, “on the one hand,” and “on the other hand,” corroborate the evidence of the grammatical construction, and show that the intent of the sentence is in accord with its grammar. Therefore, in the mind of the writer, “secularized” and “atheistic” are virtually synonymous.

A State is necessarily secularized from its inception, inaugurated for, and dedicated to, worldly matters and purposes, not spiritualized and set apart for unworldly uses; and so the term “secularized,” as applied to the State, is a proper one. The State can never be anything else. But the citizens who compose, create, and give force to the secular government, may be, and many are, God-fearing men and women.

An “atheistic State,” however, would be a very different thing. Strictly, it would be a State officially and legally denying the existence of God.

Therefore the language of the sentence is at variance with the construction and its modifying phrases, and the opposition expressed, is against three things, instead of two,—“union of Church and State” a “secularized State,” and an “atheistic State.” With the opposition to the first, all well-informed Christians will agree. With the opposition to the second, none but anarchists will sympathize, for the abolition of secular government would do away with all government. The third, all intelligent men should recognize as in rhetoric a mere figment, and in fact a nonentity.W. H. M.
