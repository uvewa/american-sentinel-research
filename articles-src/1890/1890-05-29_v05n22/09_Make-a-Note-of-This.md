IN endeavoring to show that the enforcement of rigid Sunday laws is not inconsistent with the liberties of the Jews, Mr. Crafts, in his "Sabbath for Man," page 258, says:—

> It is not sufficiently emphasized that the Jew is left absolutely free to observe the seventh day. He can close his shop; he can refuse to work.

Herein lies a principle. As long as a man has the privilege of closing his shop and refusing to work, he is free to observe a day. Question: What man has not this privilege? Certainly all men have it, the Christian as well as the Jew. Then what Sunday-keeper is not absolutely free to observe Sunday? They all are. What consistency, then, can there be in Mr. Crafts and his party pleading for a law to prevent persons from being *forced* to labor on Sunday," as they did in Washington last February, at the hearing of the House Committee on the Breckinridge Sunday Bill?

In closing his shop, the Jew of course will lose trade, and in refusing to work, perhaps lose a job; yet, says Mr. Crafts, he is left "absolutely free to observe the seventh day." The Sunday-keeper can do the same and be left just as free to observe the first day. Let us not forget to emphasize this. Law in one case is as unnecessary as in the other.—*W. A. Colcord, in Review and Herald.*
