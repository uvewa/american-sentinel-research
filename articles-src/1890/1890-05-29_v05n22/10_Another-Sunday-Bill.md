# Another Sunday Bill.

THE Sunday-closing bill for the District of Columbia, which passed the Senate, April 5, was first presented under the title, “A bill for the establishment of certain laws or ordinances for the District of Columbia,” and contained twenty-four sections. Of these, all but the first five were stricken out when the bill came to be put upon its passage. The tenth section reads as follows:—

> SEC. 10. That it shall not be lawful for any person or persons to *curse or make use of any profane language,* or any indecent or obscene words, or engage in any disorderly conduct in any street, avenue, public space, square, road or highway, or inclosure, or at any railroad depot or steamboat landing, within the District of Columbia, or in any place wherefrom the same may be heard in any such street, avenue, alley, public square, road, highway, or inclosure, or in any such depot, railroad cars, or on board any steamboat, under a penalty of not exceeding twenty dollars for each and every such offense.

Thus, under a general title which told nothing, was included a Sunday-closing law, and a law against blasphemy. The clause providing a penalty for the use of profane language, was stricken out, in the indiscriminate slaughter of nineteen sections of the bill. Senator Blair desired to amend the bill so as to cover all days of the week, but at the earnest and persistent request of the friends of the measure, desisted from offering the amendment, and yielded to the compromise with the liquor traffic, because as he said,—“*It is well to provide for the observance of the Sabbath.”* In that sentence, he characterized the measure—and the whole Sundayclosing movement.
