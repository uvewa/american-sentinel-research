AT the Protestant Episcopal House of Mercy, in this city, there is held against her wish, and the wish of her parents, a Jewish girl sixteen years old. Two years ago at her home she acted very unruly, was disobedient to her parents, and quarrelsome with her brothers and sisters, and the parents asked the police justice to commit her to a reformatory, that she might be subjected to stricter discipline than they were able to bring to bear, until she should learn better how to behave herself. The police judge sent her to this Protestant Episcopal House of Mercy, as there is no Hebrew reformatory in this city. Now the parents desire that she shall be released. They tried to secure her release upon a writ of *habeas corpus,* but it was refused because it seems that by somebody's influence other than that of the parents, she had been regularly committed to that institution until she is twenty-one years of age. The parents have earnestly besought this institution of "Mercy" to let them have their child, but the institution still holds her, and, it seems, proposes to hold her in spite of all that the parents may wish.

If such a thing as this were done by the Roman Catholics, what a universal howl of execration would go up from Protestant throats! But, as it is, we have not seen mention made of this in a single paper outside of the one that made the announcement. We can hardly help wondering whether the managers of this institution ever heard of Christ, or of Christianity. It is certain that the name of the institution should be changed; for such proceeding is anything but merciful. Such action is a libel upon both the name and the Author of mercy.
