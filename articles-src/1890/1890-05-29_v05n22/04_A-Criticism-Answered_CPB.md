NOT long since an article appeared in this paper over my signature in which I used the following words:—

> The only way to prohibit the liquor traffic is to prohibit it, not one day in the week, but every day. To make criminal upon one day in the week that which is perfectly legal at all other times, is simply to place a premium upon official corruption; to make possible persecution, as in Tennessee; and to educate people to disregard and despise the law.

This sentiment was subsequently criticised by the *Colorado Graphic* as follows:—

> But how can Mr. Bollman, if he is serious, claim for prohibition for the six days what cannot be secured for the one day? A gentleman who stands so nobly for equal rights; so manfully against religious legislation, which is always sumptuary, how can he even suggest a prohibitory law and consistently maintain his other positions? Did he not read that in Bangor, in prohibition Maine, one hundred and fifty saloons (speak-easies) had been discovered and were closed by the Mayor, and that in thirty days thereafter there were fifty others discovered? No, sir; sumptuary legislation is a failure.

The writer does not pretend to say that prohibition has ever been a success in the sense of stopping all liquor drinking, or even all liquor selling, especially in large cities; nor does he pretend to say that it ever will be a success in any such sense. But be that as it may it proves nothing as to the merits of the question. Theft and prostitution, and gambling and lotteries are forbidden by law, but they are not prohibited in the sense of being absolutely prevented. They are, however, greatly lessened by the laws against them, and so has liquor selling and the evils which spring from it been greatly reduced by prohibitory laws in Maine, Iowa, and Kansas. It is, therefore, idle to argue that because saloons (speak-easies) exist in Bangor, prohibition is wrong or even that it is a political mistake. The only question is, Has the State a just right to prohibit the traffic in intoxicating drinks?

The *Graphic* assumes that prohibitory laws are of the same nature as Sunday laws, and other measures of religious legislation. This is a mistake as can easily be shown. About the only thing in common between them is that many religious people favor both. But the fact that religious people are in favor of two measures does not prove that they are both equally good or equally bad. Prohibition is in no sense religious. Very many religious people do not believe in it, while a great many people who make no profession of religion are in favor of it as a matter of public policy, and as necessary for the protection of life and property. The evil effects of liquor drinking are not confined to those who drink. Every intoxicated man is a menace to life and property, not his own life and property merely, but the lives and properties of others; and can it be that society has no right to protect itself against the danger?

Again, the traffic in intoxicating liquors entails upon the State enormous expenditures for the apprehension, trial, and imprisonment of criminals, and for the care of paupers. Crime and pauperism are the legitimate fruits of the liquor traffic, and can it be that the State has no right to prohibit that which has proved itself to be the most prolific contributor to our prisons, alms houses, and insane asylums? Certainly right and justice demand the prohibition of a business that burdens the State as the liquor traffic does. Suppose that the State has no right to prevent a man from drinking what he pleases, and that where and when he pleases, does it follow that it has no right to prohibit the public traffic in that which beggars whole families and turns them out paupers to be supported by those who by honest toil have accumulated property which bears its just proportion of taxation?

But it is said that prohibition interferes with personal liberty. Proper prohibition will never interfere with personal liberty. Moreover the cry of personal liberty does not come as a rule from the men who drink, but from those who grow rich by ministering to the most depraved appetites of their fellow-men. The liberty which they demand is liberty to enrich themselves by burdening the public with paupers and criminals. Are they justly entitled to such liberty? Hardly.

Liquor men themselves grant the right of the State to *regulate* the traffic in which they are engaged, and that not merely for revenue but to restrict the evils which it engenders. But the right to regulate carries with it the right to prohibit. And this is one reason why the State has no right to legislate upon religious matters, or in any way regulate the exercise of religion. If the State had the right to require or to forbid one religious observance, it would have the right to require or to forbid any or all others. This is why all Christians who prize religious liberty as they should, and who are willing that others should enjoy the same privileges that they themselves do, oppose all State interference in religious matters. They insist that all must be left absolutely free to worship or not to worship just as they please. But every body recognizes the right of the State to regulate liquor selling; to say that A may sell, and that B shall not sell. But whether they realize it or not, if the State has the right to say that one man shall not sell intoxicating liquors it has the right to say that no man shall sell such liquors. Did liquor dealers for a moment believe that their business is as legitimate as any other, and that the "right" to sell liquor rests upon the same ground as the right to worship, they would demand, not license as they now do, but [171] absolute freedom. But while prohibitory laws are purely civil, and the enacting of them not only the right but the duty of the State, Sunday laws are of an entirely different character. Sunday is a religious institution; its friends call it the *Christian *Sabbath, and most of them insist that it ought to be kept in obedience to the fourth commandment. It is therefore no more the right of the State to enforce its observance than it would be to enforce baptism or the Lord's Supper.

Laws forbidding the sale of intoxicating liquors to be used as beverages, violate no man's conscience. Nobody sells whiskey as a religious duty. The whole traffic is demoralizing and fraught with danger to life and property, and liquor dealers themselves know and acknowledge that this is so. But a failure to religiously keep Sunday endangers neither life nor property; it makes neither criminals nor paupers. Many good citizens and earnest Christians do not regard Sunday, because they do not believe that there is any divine law requiring its observance, and they exercise their God-given right to labor upon that day; but in so doing they do not prey upon others, they do not injure anybody in any way, nor do they burden the State. In short, there is no similarity whatever between Sunday work or business, and the liquor traffic: and there is and can be no more similarity between Sunday laws and prohibitory laws. The reasons for Sunday laws are wholly religious; while the only proper reasons for prohibition are wholly civil and political.C. P. BOLLMAN.
