IN the arguments on the subject of "Education and the State," which are now so widely made, it is often stated that ignorance is the mother of crime, and that therefore it is for the interest of the State that its citizens should be intelligent if it would have good citizens, as intelligence is the mother of virtue. This is not true. It would be hard to prove that ignorance is any more the mother of crime than is intelligence. The ignorant are not the only ones who commit crime. Go to any penitentiary, and, although we have not actually tested the matter, we feel perfectly safe in saying that of the inmates, it will be found that those who can read and write are not the minority. Ninety- four per cent of the criminals of New York State can read. Thousands upon thousands of boys to-day, are reading stuff that tends infinitely more to make them criminals than the inability to read could possibly do. It is a fact that from one of the Western penitentiaries a regular newspaper is issued. All the type setting, editorial work and everything in connection with it, is done by the regular convicts of the penitentiary. With hundreds, yea, thousands of people in the penitentiaries, the trouble with them was not that they could not write, but that they wrote too much, and too well, especially other people's names. The bank wreckers, the embezzlers, and the forgers, are not persons who are ignorant, they are people of excellent education.

This is not in any sense an argument in favor of ignorance and against education. It simply illustrates the fact that education does not give character, while it is, in fact, only character that counts. A man may have an excellent character and be either ignorant or educated, but if he is not honest he will steal, whether he be ignorant or educated. In fact, if he be not honest, the probabilities are that education will make him the greater thief, as in the case of the forgers, the bank wreckers and the embezzlers.

Let the people be educated most completely everywhere, but let character be built up in them at the same time.
