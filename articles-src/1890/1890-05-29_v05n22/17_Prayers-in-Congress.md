OF prayers in Congress, the *Christian Statesman* remarks:—

> "If the silence of the national Constitution as to religion is to be construed as a deliberate and intentional renunciation of all religion by the American Nation, then such prayers, or any prayers, in Congress, or in any State Legislature, are an impertinence and an anachronism, and ought to be abolished."

That deduction is perfectly logical, and the logic ought to be turned into a fact. Chaplaincies in Congress, in State Legislatures, the army, etc., *are* an impertinence and an anachronism. They are a relic of the hierarchical rule of the Middle Ages, and ought to be abolished. Legally, chaplains are unconstitutional loafers; physically, however, they are strictly constitutional loafers.
