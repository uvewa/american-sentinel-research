IN the course of a speech to the Senate in introducing a bill to repeal laws providing for the retirement of army and other officers, delivered in the Senate of the United States, April 23, Senator Reagan, of Texas, said:—

> It seems to me we can only account for the creation of privileged classes in this country, on the hypothesis that it is the result of a skillfully devised plan of those in this country who contemn the political doctrines of the illustrious Mr. Jefferson and his followers, who seek by this means to subvert our Federal system of States with reserved rights, and of people with reserved liberties, and on the wreck of this system to establish a strong, consolidated, centralized Government with power to repress and control the popular will, and, in the interest of the few, to establish a Government of force and coercion in the place of our present democratic Government based on the consent and agreement of the people and States.

In these words, Mr. Reagan has expressed the greatest danger which threatens this commonwealth, and one which has already passed its inception.
