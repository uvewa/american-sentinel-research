THE *Christian Statesman* refers to the illegal divorces granted to Hebrews in this country by Jewish Rabbis, some of whom assume the prerogative of the State in such cases, and then it says:—

> These facts illustrate the necessity for maintaining and enforcing carefully the distinctively Christian laws of the American Government.

We have nothing to say against the better enforcement of the laws in such cases, or against the necessity for better and more uniform laws governing the subject of divorce, but we do object to having such laws styled "Christian laws." To say that they are Christian laws is to say that marriage is a Christian institution, and that the State has a right to enforce Christianity by legal enactment.

The chief object of the *Statesman* at the present time seems to be to make the people of this country believe that they have already legislated upon Christianity, and that, since they have already enacted some "Christian laws," there is no reason why they should not now go on and legislate upon Christianity to any desired extent. This is their argument precisely, and it shows what must be the inevitable result if religious legislation is ever begun in this country. It shows the imperative necessity of watching every move of legislative bodies, that no false step shall be taken which will establish a precedent for legislation upon Christianity.

We agree that laws regulating marriage are right; that is, that there should be such laws; but we deny that marriage is a Christian institution, or that in passing such laws it is necessary to legislate upon the Christian religion.

1. Marriage is not a Christian institution because it originated before Christianity. It was instituted about four thousand years before the commencement of the Christian dispensation. In fact it was instituted before the fall of man, and consequently before man needed a Saviour and Christianity to redeem him.

2. Christian institutions are for Christians. If marriage were a Christian institution, then none but Christians would have a right to marry. But people who are not Christians have as much right to marry as those who are; therefore, marriage is not a Christian institution.

3. No one can be a Christian without observing all known Christian institutions. Hence, if marriage was a Christian institution, no one could be a Christian unless he was married. But that the *Christian Statesman* itself knows is not true.

Therefore we say that laws which regulate marriage are not Christian laws, but civil laws.
