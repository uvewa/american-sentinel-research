THE mischief of Sunday laws is again illustrated by a case out in Indiana. Mr. C. W. Cook keeps a hotel at New Haven. Some time ago he allowed the agent of the Toledo Automatic Cigar Company to put up on the outside of his house one of those little machines into which one drops a nickel and gets a cigar. On Sunday April 20, somebody dropped a nickel into the thing, got a cigar and smoked it. Mr. Cook knew nothing about it, had nothing to do with the machine himself, nor has he any of the profits of it at all, but simply allowed the owner of it to place it there, yet *he was prosecuted for Sunday desecration. *A change of venue was secured, and the case was tried in Ft. Wayne. After deliberating all night the jury brought in a verdict of guilty with a fine of one dollar and costs, and the costs amounted to over fifty dollars.

This well illustrates the value of Sunday laws. All they are worth, or that they ever were worth, is simply to give a chance to meddlesome bigots to pester, or vent their spite upon, their neighbors. This is the only earthly thing that Sunday laws are used for now, and it is the only thing they ever will be used for; and if the Sunday-law advocates get the laws enacted which they so long for, this simply illustrates in a very mild way, what will be the fruit of them.
