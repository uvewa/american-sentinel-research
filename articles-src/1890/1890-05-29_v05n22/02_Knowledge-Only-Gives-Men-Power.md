THE following quotation from Professor W. G. Sumner, of Yale College, makes an excellent statement of an important truth. Knowledge is not enough; there must be with it sufficient character to make a right use of it:—

"The moralists have never been satisfied with the old adage that knowledge is power. They felt the lack of the moral element in it: that is to say, they felt the lack of the element which it was their business to supply. The adage, however, was true. Knowledge is power, and, in itself considered, it is nothing more. The notion that knowledge makes men good is one of the superstitions of the nineteenth century. Knowledge only gives men power. It furnishes a chance. It brings with it, however, thé grim alternative already described. Will the man who has it use it for good or for ill? That is a moral question. It finds its answer in the springs of character, and the independent self-determination which lies deepest in the essential elements of each man's personality. This, by the way, is one of the reasons why there is no sound social or personal strength which is not founded on the training of the individual. It is the reason why individual character is the spring of all good in man or the State, and why all socialism is profoundly immoral. Wherever collective standards, codes, ideals, and motives take the place of individual responsibility, we know from ample experience that the spontaneity and independent responsibility which are essential to moral vigor are sure to be lost."
