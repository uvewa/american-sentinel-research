# Good Work in California.

IN the *Chronicle-Union* of Bridgeport, California, April 26, we find an excellent report of a large and enthusiastic meeting, held by the citizens of that place “for the purpose of entering their protest against Congress interfering in the religious concerns of the American people.” The meeting was addressed by the Chairman, Mr. W. O. Parker; District Attorney, C. L. Hayes; and Mr. J. H. Cook, Vice-President of the National Religious Liberty Association. With reference to the Blair Religious Amendment Mr. Hayes very aptly remarked: “‘The Constitution as it is’ is my motto. It was amended twenty-five years ago to free the slave; and I am not in favor of now tacking on another amendment to enslave the people.”

Judge Eddy suggested that all present who had not signed the remonstrance to Congress, be invited to do so before leaving the house.

A series of strong resolutions was adopted denouncing the Blair Amendment and the Sunday bills before Congress, from which we copy the following two:—

> *Resolved,* That we most earnestly request the Senators and Representatives of this State in Congress to oppose the adoption of the joint resolution and measures referred to. That a copy of these resolutions be forwarded to said Representatives for presentation to the Senate and House, and that the county newspapers be, and they are hereby respectfully requested to publish the same with the proceedings of this meeting.

> *Resolved,* That the earnest and effective work being performed by the National Religious Liberty Association in opposition to such legislation and to said proposed amendment to the Constitution meets with our unqualified approval, and that J. H. Cook, Vice-President, and Assistant Ira Wheeler, present at this meeting, deserve the thanks of the people for their untiring zeal manifested in advancing the cause of the Association.
The report closes as follows:—

> The meeting then adjourned, when all present, except one or two, signed the remonstrance, if they had not previously. The meeting was a very orderly one and fully reflected the sentiments of our people on these most unpopular measures.

We are glad it is so; and let the good work go on.
