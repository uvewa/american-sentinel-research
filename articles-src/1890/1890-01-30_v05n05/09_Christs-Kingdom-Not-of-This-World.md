THERE was a constant expectancy upon the part of Jesus' followers that he would take to himself regal power, and reign as king. Human power was inseparably connected with their ideas of success; and this expectancy often found expression in queries which plainly show the shape their hopes had taken. But the Saviour did not encourage the idea of associating his work with the kingdoms of the world. Exactly the opposite. He taught the doctrines of brothership instead of lordship; he called his disciples "friends," not servants; he taught meekness instead of "the manly art of self-defence;" humility, instead of pomp and pride. He taught that it was better to suffer wrong than to commit it; that it was better to be aggrieved than to be the aggressor; that mercy and forgiveness should prevail over justice, which was to be committed to him who judgeth righteously.

These characteristics plainly mark both his teachings and his life from beginning to close. When Peter resorted to the sword, he rebuked his spirit, and substituted kindness. When James and John suggested that the argument of fire from heaven be used upon those Samaritans who would not receive him, Jesus said, "Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of. For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them." Luke 9:55, 56.

He held at his disposal "more than twelve legions of angels;" but he never invoked the physical constraint of one of them to defend his cause or enforce his creed.

"Learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart," exclaims the great Author and Finisher of the Christian faith. It would have been well for the cause, and for its adherents since that time, had they fully comprehended the real spirit of the cause they profess, and possessed more of the spirit of its Master. But from that time until the present, men have sought to place the cause of Christ upon the support of civil power. Legislators and rulers have been petitioned and besought to take the interests and institutions of the Church under the fostering wing of legal protection; and wherever this has been tried, the result has been most disastrous to pure and undefiled religion. The Saviour says, "My kingdom is not of this world." Nor is this world any part of Christ's kingdom. *—Bible Echo, Australia.*
