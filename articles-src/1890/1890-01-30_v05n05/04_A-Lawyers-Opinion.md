# A Lawyer’s Opinion.

THE Washington *Post,* of January 12, has the following sensible communication from a prominent lawyer of that city. We commend it to the careful consideration of our readers:—

“The *Post* of January 6, 1890, published a dispatch from London, of the date of January 5, which says:—

> The Rome correspondent of the *Pall Mall Gazette *has had a remarkable interview with Monsignor Satelli, which reveals a mental grasp on the part of the prelate, fairly note worthy. The whole report is a gem, but this is perhaps the best thing: “All our bishops in the United States,” says Satelli, “are treated as sovereign princes, and Archbishop Ireland is the personal friend of Harrison. As a Democrat, he belongs to his party. He told Harrison that unless he would pledge himself to make concessions to the Catholic schools, all the Catholics would withdraw their votes from him. So he was obliged to do so. The public corporations, too, are only too glad to fulfil the wishes of our bishops, even before they are expressed.

“I think there must be some mistake about this; but the charge is one of such grave significance that President Harrison owes it to. himself, and to the country at large, to stamp it with a prompt denial.

“Our Government is purely secular in its character and purposes. It is vested with no ecclesiastical power whatever. It has no right, nor any constitutional power, to appropriate a single dollar for the support of Catholic or of Protestant schools, or schools of any religious denomination, nor to legislate, in any way, for or against any religious sect, or on the subject of religion. Every Catholic in the land is entitled to the same consideration, the same protection, the same benefits and advantages as the Protestant, the Jew, the Mohammedan, and the infidel, and no more; all are entitled to the same consideration and the same protection.

“Our Government is not a Christian nor an anti-Christian Government; nor in any sense an ecclesiastical Government, but purely secular; it is designed for the benefit and protection of all classes of men—men of all religions, and men of no religion.

“On the other hand, the Papal Government, so called, is purely an ecclesiastical organization, and is invested with no civil powers. There may be some points of agreement and contact between the Papal hierarchy and the several Governments of Europe, for the reason that in all the Governments of Europe there is, to some extent, a mingling of civil and ecclesiastical powers. But with our Government it is entirely different. Between the Papal hierarchy and the Government of the United States there is no point of contact or agreement; nothing upon which the two can mutually and officially act. The one is spiritual, the other temporal.

“And it is for that reason that there has never been any official representation of either at the court of the other during the century of our existence as a nation. What would be thought of the Episcopal Church of England, or the Greek Church of Russia sending a minister plenipotentiary or ambassador to represent the interest of either at the Government of the United States? And yet the papal authority is no more dominant in civil affairs in Italy than is the Episcopal Church in England, or the Greek Church in Russia.

“It may be well to note in this connection, the bill recently introduced in the House of Representatives by Mr. Breckinridge, of Kentucky, “To prevent persons [in the District of Columbia] being forced to labor on Sunday.” The title prefixed to this bill is a misnomer. It is not even pretended, either by the provisions of the bill itself, or by its author, that any ‘person in the District of Columbia has been compelled to labor on Sunday, at any time since the abolition of slavery therein.

“This bill, if passed, will be in direct violation of the Constitution of the United States, which declares that ‘Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.’

“It is based upon the false and shabby pretense that mankind are by nature so fond of labor and so ambitious to work as to call for the restraint of law to save them from the consequences of overwork, while, in fact, it is designed by its authors as an entering wedge for a wide system of aggressive laws on religious subjects in derogation of the Constitution and of the civil rights and religious freedom of the citizen.

“It is high time to sound the alarm, when a comparatively small, but influential, and well-organized body of ambitious and unrestful Protestants, and backed by the Jesuits of the Catholic hierarchy, boldly and openly seek to change the character, if not the form of our Government, from a purely secular to an ecclesiastical or priestly rule, which experience has proved to be, of all forms of government, the most tyrannical, the most cruel, and the most oppressive.C. H. B.”
