# Compelled to be Saved.

IN the Elgin, Illinois, convention of Congregational ministers, November. 8, 1887, Dr. W. W. Everts, of Chicago, in speaking of the prevalence of Sabbath desecration and its remedy, said: “This day is set apart for divine worship and a preparation for another life. It is the test of all religion.” That is to say, Sabbath-keeping is the test of all religion, and he who will not keep the Sabbath has no religion. But if he will not keep it he must be forced to, and thus act as though he had religion, no matter how corrupt at heart. Such a law would be, only could be, productive of the rankest hypocrisy. God will never accept of such a coerced religion. We admit, with Dr. Everts, that the Sabbath was given to assist in a preparation for another life; but when measures are adopted to compel men to prepare for another life, it is going beyond the jurisdiction of the Church or the State.

Dr. Everts further said: “He who does not keep the Sabbath does not worship God; and he who does not worship God, is lost.” Exactly, and a law to compel people to keep the Sabbath is nothing less than a law to compel people to worship God. If they will *not* keep the Sabbath, and thereby worship God, they are lost; therefore, they must be *compelled* to keep the Sabbath, worship God, and be saved.

Obedience to God, voluntarily rendered, is the greatest test of love and the highest form of worship. Said Christ: “If ye love me, keep my commandments:” John 14:15. But who ever heard of Christ compelling the people to show their love to him by forcing them to keep his commandments? The Scriptures set forth no such principle. The Sabbath belongs to Christ, and when on earth he told the people that he was Lord of it. Mark 2:28. There were Sabbath breakers all around him, but he did not appeal to Cesar for a law to compel them to keep it. He used the best means for saving people,—persuasion mingled with the deepest love. If compulsory measures had been a potent agent in saving those for whom he came to die, he might have used them.

It seems to be the design of ambitious clergymen, who are more zealous for an outward display than for inward piety, to transform this Government from a civil to an ecclesiastical power, and have a few men like the Roman pontiff, sit upon ecclesiastical thrones and make their interpretations of the Scriptures the law of the land. As a stepping stone to this they make Sabbath observance a test of personal religion and worship, and then tell the people they are lost if they do not come up to the test, thus trying to frighten them into favoring a Sunday law.

It is a good thing to keep the Sabbath and worship God; but it is a detestable, thing to *compel* people to keep it, and deceive them into the idea that obedience to such a law will save them. If the people cannot see the motive of those engaged in this Sunday-law business, it must be because they will not, or do not, investigate the matter, and reason from cause to effect.E. HILLIARD.
