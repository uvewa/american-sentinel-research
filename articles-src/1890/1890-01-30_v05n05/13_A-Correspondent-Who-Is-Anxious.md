A reader writes as follows, from Dassel, Minnesota:—

> "EDITORS AMERICAN SENTINEL: I have been an interested reader of your valuable little paper for some months, and feel to bid you God speed in your work, and hope you will soon be able to double the size of the SENTINEL. I have been so anxious about the Sunday movement, and fear so much to see the Blair Sunday Bill become law, that I have determined, God being my helper, to try to warn the people of the impending danger of Sunday and other religious laws. I am not a Seventh-day keeper."

We sincerely wish that there were thousands of other people in this country who would become as anxious as that and act in this same way to relieve their anxiety.
