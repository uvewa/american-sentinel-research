THE Blair Sunday bill has again appeared upon the scene of Congressional action, to seek at the hands of our present national legislators that recognition which it failed to get from the members of the Fiftieth Congress. The better to secure this, and that the public eye may not be turned upon it in suspicion, it has discarded its religious features and assumed a garb which is studiously secular. How this has been done will be evident to the reader from a comparison of the two phases of the bill, as given herewith, the essential points of difference being indicated by the use of italics and small capitals:—

It will be noticed, first, that a conspicuous change has taken place in the introductory clause which defines the purpose of the bill. As originally defined, its purpose was "to secure to the people the enjoyment of the first day of the week, . . . and *to promote its observance as a day of religious worship"* Now it is merely "to secure to the people the privileges of rest and of religious worship" on that day, "free from disturbance by others." The religious phase of the bill has disappeared entirely. It is now intended only as a mild and beneficient civil regulation, having in view the laudable object of securing to the people the privileges of undisturbed rest and religious worship on the first day of the week, of which it seems they have in some way been deprived!

This great change having been made in the object for which the bill was framed, we naturally look for a corresponding change in the bill itself. But here a strange fact presents itself; there is no change in the body of the bill at all. The same measures which one year ago would accomplish the object of securing to the people the enjoyment of the Lord's day as a day of rest, and promote its observance as a day of religious worship, are now considered necessary merely to give people a chance to rest and worship undisturbed! All those little phrases which upon the first appearance of the bill stamped it as a religious measure, have been pruned off, and it now appears labeled, "civil regulation." But it is the same old bill, imposing the same restrictions and exacting the same penalties. The change of label does not make it more desirable, or any less deserving of universal and uncompromising opposition.

Another strange thing which the above comparison brings out, is the sudden change which seems to have taken place in the public conception of the first day of the week. Only one year ago this day was as the bill stated, "commonly known as the Lord's day;" now the first day of the week is "commonly known as Sunday." It must be that the secularization of the day is indeed taking place at a rapid rate!

It is further noticeable that the authors of the bill in its present form have provided it with the semblance of an exemption clause for those who observe some other than the first day of the week. In the latter half of the last section it is stated that the bill shall not be construed "to prohibit or to sanction labor on Sunday by individuals who conscientiously believe in and observe any other day than Sunday as the Sabbath or a day of religious worship." There immediately follows, however, the qualifying clause, "provided such labor be not done to the disturbance of others." By referring to the first section, we find that all that the bill requires of any one, observer of Sunday or nonobserver, is that he shall not engage in labor on that day to the disturbance of others. The bill when it was before the last Congress, contained the same provision. The propriety of the term "semblance," as used above, is therefore evident. The bill virtually says, with true National Reform generosity, that where persons religiously observe any other day than Sunday, they shall not, on this account, be prohibited from labor and recreation entirely, but shall have the same privilege which all others enjoy of engaging in such labor and recreation on Sunday as will not be to the disturbance of others! This is doubtless in the line of those "concessions" of which we have heard from Mr. Crafts and others, and for which, as he says, observers of the seventh day have never shown any great disposition to be thankful.

It is hardly necessary to say that the thin secular guise in which this bill now makes its appearance, does not make it any less worthy of the strenuous opposition of every patriotic and liberty-loving American citizen than it was before this guise was assumed. The character and intent of the bill were plainly shown when it was introduced as a bill to "promote" the observance of the "Lord's day" as "a day of religious worship;" and the addition which the past year has made to the stock of wisdom of its originators, comes too late to make its secular guise effective. The bill is the same now that it was when first introduced, and in the opposition which we trust will be brought against it from all quarters, its advocates will have to meet this fact, and with it the stigma which must in every candid mind attach to their work, as a result of their manifest hypocrisy.—*Review and Herald.*
