A CORRESPONDENT of the *World- Herald* (Omaha, Nebraska), writing upon the Sabbath question, says:—

> "While I am in favor of having one day in seven to be observed as a day of rest, or holiday, I believe with Martin Luther, that it is wholly wrong to have any law compelling anyone to observe it as a holy day, and all who are sincere in believing such a law to be right do so through the prejudice of education, not from truth, reason and facts, for they contradict such a thought."
