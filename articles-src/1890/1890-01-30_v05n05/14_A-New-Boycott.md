GENERALLY speaking, absolute consistency in any human enterprise that is at all complex in its bearings is impossible; but the efforts of those persons who would compel the cessation of all work on Sunday are rather unusually inconsistent. Consistency, while not essential (in fact it may often be a sign of weakness), is nevertheless held to be a jewel; and inconsistency *in extremis* becomes absurdity.

The attempted coercion of the people of the United States to observe a certain Sabbath in a certain way, is absurd.

The people of this Republic have attained to a certain degree of intellectual independence. Thinkers of great thoughts doubtless are rare, as they have ever been, but thinkers of practical thoughts have become exceedingly numerous; and the habit of social self-reliance, fostered by political freedom, has engendered a corresponding intellectual or mental self- reliance, which is freeing the race from superstition and moral bondage exactly as popular education frees it from literal ignorance.

People no longer believe that kings have divine rights—at least the people of the United States do not. In fact, the Declaration of our Independence teaches us that all governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. The Constitution of the United States recognizes no higher source of power than the "consent of the governed." That idea has permeated the social as well as the political fabric.

The Church is a social institution, with spiritual jurisdiction over its members. That the ministers, pastors, or priests have any powers beyond those delegated by the consent of their congregations or flocks is not now generally believed; yet that assumption seems to be the "head and front" of the so-called Sabbatarian movement. . . .

That a man should rest one day in every seven is not at all unreasonable. But to compel him by law to rest one day in seven, and to designate by law which of the seven shall be the day of rest for him and all other men, is a measure to which the "consent of the governed" can never be gained. It is arbitrary and unreasonable, regarded from any but a sectarian . standpoint. True, the commandment enjoins: "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy," etc. . . . But when they seek to impose upon unwilling fellow citizens such observance, they must of necessity show a higher source of authority than any named in the Constitution; and it is then that the inconsistencies of divers religious systems and the basic discrepancies of denominational opinions become fatal weaknesses which stamp the acts of the Sabbatarians with the seal of absurdity.—*Peublo (Col.) Sunday Opinion. *[39]
