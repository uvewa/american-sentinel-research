THE Elmira (N. Y.) *Telegram* says:—

There is no power in the Constitution of the United States to prescribe the modes and time for the religious observance of any day in the week. The people are at liberty, without restriction, or definition of duty, to worship God in their own way, according to the dictates of their own conscience. Laws cannot be built to make a man rest when he isn't tired, or regulate the way he shall get rested when he is. [41]
