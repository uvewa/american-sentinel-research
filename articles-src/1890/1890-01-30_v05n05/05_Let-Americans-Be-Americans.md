IN the following editorial from the *Tribune* of this city there is a valuable point, one which we wish there was made much more of throughout the land. The aping of European ways by Americans is a shame and a disgrace to every one who does it.

"At the Holland Society's dinner on Friday night Mr. Theodore Roosevelt made some remarks in an old-fashioned way upon an old-fashioned subject. After recalling the social, political, military, financial and other triumphs of American citizens of Dutch ancestry, Mr. Roosevelt made the point that whatever may have been the strength and virtue of their Holland blood, they wrought as Americans, and could not have won the renown that has rewarded their labors had they remained Hollanders here. He then proceeded to apply this point to existing situations, and to urge the duty of all foreigners to become heartily and sincerely American. This is in no sense a new suggestion, but it needs to be constantly enforced upon the attention, not only of foreigners, but of native-born Americans as well.

"There is a class of Americans, almost confined to the Eastern cities, who have seemed to think it an evidence of culture and of social and intellectual rank to indulge in supercilious' reflections upon their country and their countrymen. We have lately feared that this class of people was growing, not merely among the silly creatures who have neither brains nor any use for brains, but among really estimable persons and as the result of a propaganda undertaken primarily in the interest of certain European economic theories. The zeal and industry of those in charge of the propaganda have not seemed to be satisfied with those comparisons which in their eyes show the superior excellence of foreign industrial systems, but they have felt it necessary also to sneer at all things commonly thought to be characteristic of our society.

"They sneer at our politics, declaring in effect that no such thing exists as an honest American politician; that all officeholders in this land, where we teach officeholding to be no man's right, but every man's proper aspiration, are selfish, corrupt slaves of party; that to be prominent in the council or active in the management of a party is to be utterly wicked and unclean—to be, indeed, a "machine politician" is their synonym for "devil." They sneer at our educational system and methods, and affect to think we have no "real colleges," apparently believing it impossible for an educator to be wise without a wig or efficient as a teacher without a gown. They sneer at our press, and save themselves vast intellectual effort by throwing all their fine scorn into the quotation marks with which they invariable, surround the word journalism. They have not yet got ready to attack the public school system or freedom of worship, but they do what they can to prevent the extension of the public school system, and they plainly indicate that they have more faith in the piety of a bishop who is also "my lord" than of one whose character is unaided by civil title. They apparently act upon the belief that it is a sign of broad-mindedness and liberality to take that view of a method or that side of a controversy Which is antagonistic to the popular American view.

"These people are not very susceptible to arguments, but they are painfully sensitive as to the impression they produce upon others. They wish to be thought vastly clever. If it could only be got into their heads that, on the contrary, they really excite only pity and ridicule, it would probably do them good."
