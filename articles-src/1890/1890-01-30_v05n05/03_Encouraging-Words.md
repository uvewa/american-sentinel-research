# Encouraging Words.

THE Oakland (California) daily *Times *of January 10, notices the removal of the AMERICAN SENTINEL to this city, as follows:—

## “Departure Of A Faithful Sentinel.”

“Oakland has one religious paper the less by the removal of the AMERICAN SENTINEL, published for four years in Oakland, by the Pacific Press Publishing Company, to New York.

“The ability of this paper, under the editorial charge from the first of Elder E. J. Waggoner and Professor A. T. Jones, has been marked, and its deserved success phenominal. Starting as an eight-page monthly, in January, 1886, it attained the first year to a circulation of over 136,000 copies, and the third year of more than 600,000. Last January it became a weekly and had a circulation during the year of over 1,000,000 copies. Its avowed aim, thus far consistently and energetically carried out, has been to oppose every principle, effort or movement which tends in any way to a union of Church and State, and to preserve inviolable the strictly secular and non-sectarian attitudes adopted by the fathers of our Republic and embodied in the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution, as also in the Constitutions of this and all the other States of the Union. An organized, determined and persistent effort is being made to overturn this fundamental principle and introduce a religious amendment which, if adopted by Congress and endorsed by the popular vote, will thoroughly sectarianize the Constitution. Against this movement the AMERICAN SENTINEL is dot ing and is bound to do valiant battles. It holds, with Roger Williams, that ‘ civil government should rule in civil things only,’ and, with George Washington, that ‘ every man who conducts himself as a good citizen is accountable to God alone for his religious faith, ’ and that any interference with this right in the way of penal Sunday laws or otherwise is a wanton and flagrant usurpation and should be resisted by every loyal American citizen with his utmost power.

> “In principles and sentiments the *Morning Times,* with most of its brethren of the secular press, fully agrees, and we are glad to see in the last issue of the AMERICAN SENTINEL a hearty acknowledgement of sympathy and encouragement extended by various representatives of the California secular press, and particular by the Oakland *Morning Times.*

> “The change of location to the metropolis of the Nation and the center of the battle on this national question, is undoubtedly a good one, and we believe and predict that the AMERICAN SENTINEL will at least double its last year’s circulation of 1,000,000 copies during the current year.” [38]
