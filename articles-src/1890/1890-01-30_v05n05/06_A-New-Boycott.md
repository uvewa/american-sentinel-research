# A New Boycott.

GENERALLY speaking, absolute consistency in any human enterprise that is at all complex in its bearings is impossible; but the efforts of those persons who would compel the cessation of all work on Sunday are rather unusually inconsistent. Consistency, while not essential (in fact it may often be a sign of weakness), is nevertheless held to be a jewel; and inconsistency *in extremis* becomes absurdity.

The attempted coercion of the people of the United States to observe a certain Sabbath in a certain way, is absurd.

The people of this Republic have attained to a certain degree of intellectual independence. Thinkers of great thoughts doubtless are rare, as they have ever been, but thinkers of practical thoughts have become exceedingly numerous; and the habit of social self-reliance, fostered by political freedom, has engendered a corresponding intellectual or mental self- reliance, which is freeing the race from superstition and moral bondage exactly as popular education frees it from literal ignorance.

People no longer believe that kings have divine rights—at least the people of the United States do not. In fact, the Declaration of our Independence teaches us that all governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. The Constitution of the United States recognizes no higher source of power than the “consent of the governed.” That idea has permeated the social as well as the political fabric.

The Church is a social institution, with spiritual jurisdiction over its members. That the ministers, pastors, or priests have any powers beyond those delegated by the consent of their congregations or flocks is not now generally believed; yet that assumption seems to be the “head and front” of the so-called Sabbatarian movement. . . .

That a man should rest one day in every seven is not at all unreasonable. But to compel him by law to rest one day in seven, and to designate by law which of the seven shall be the day of rest for him and all other men, is a measure to which the “consent of the governed” can never be gained. It is arbitrary and unreasonable, regarded from any but a sectarian . standpoint. True, the commandment enjoins: “Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy,” etc. . . . But when they seek to impose upon unwilling fellow citizens such observance, they must of necessity show a higher source of authority than any named in the Constitution; and it is then that the inconsistencies of divers religious systems and the basic discrepancies of denominational opinions become fatal weaknesses which stamp the acts of the Sabbatarians with the seal of absurdity.—*Peublo (Col.) Sunday Opinion. *[39]

ONE of the recommendations adopted by the Paris International Sunday Congress, upon “The Weekly Rest Day from a Social Point of View,” is this:—

> The smallest amount of rest which man ought to have is one day in seven; we mean by that, the Sabbath day, for that which is necessary for man is not a lay of relief from labor only, but a day for true moral elevation.

If it is a day of rest simply from a social point of view, what matters it which day it is. From a social point of view, one man or a thousand men can rest just as well on one day as another. But that is not what the Congress meant to recommend. The Congress “means” that the Sabbath day is the one which shall be observed for, rest and which is the smallest amount of rest that any man ought to take, and that not for physical rest primarily, but for true moral elevation. In this the Congress abandons the social point of view, adopts the religious, and places the day of rest upon the religious basis, and by so doing, it contradicts itself in its recommendation. But this is not an exceptional case by any means. No argument has ever yet been made professedly from a civil or social point of view that did not in fact rest upon the religious. And no such argument ever can be made. The thing is religious in itself. It cannot be made anything else and by no argument can it ever be made consistantly to *appear* anything else.

REFERRING to the Blair Sunday Bill now pending in Congress, the Litchfield (Minn.) *Independent* says:—

> We have no hesitancy in giving our opinion that such legislation would be an act of bigotry not worthy this day and age. Let the Government keep its hands off from any interference with the religious conduct of the people so long as the rights of others are not concerned. If the stability of the Christian religion now dominant in this country depends on any bolstering acts like the Blair bill, better let the structure topple at once.

A CORRESPONDENT of the *World- Herald* (Omaha, Nebraska), writing upon the Sabbath question, says:—

> “While I am in favor of having one day in seven to be observed as a day of rest, or holiday, I believe with Martin Luther, that it is wholly wrong to have any law compelling anyone to observe it as a holy day, and all who are sincere in believing such a law to be right do so through the prejudice of education, not from truth, reason and facts, for they contradict such a thought.” [40]

THE *Christian Nation* criticises the SENTINEL for maintaining that “governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed,” and makes an extended argument to prove that this is not true. We know that it is not true according to the National Reform religious-legislation theory; but it is true according to the American theory, and the American theory is true according to the Word of God.

THE American Sabbath Union prints the following inquiry:—

> Is it not time to start a righteous crusade, under the laws of God and of man, in abolition of this ruinous system of [Sunday] bondage?

Oh, certainly it is! Let the crusade be started at once. Let this cruel bondage be abolished. And in order that this may be accomplished swiftly and certainly, we suggest that the American Sabbath Union change its name to the American Abolition Union. Let slavery be abolished, say we, forever!

December 29th, Mr. Crafts, of the American Sabbath Union, delivered an address at Association Hall, 86th Street, New York City. In that address he said:—

> The national Lay Congress of Roman Catholics after correspondence and conference with the American Sabbath Union, passed its famous resolution in favor of co-operation with Protestants in Sabbath reform of which the following is a full and correct copy: “There are many Christian issues in which Catholics could come together with non-Catholics and shape civil legislation for the public weal. In spite of rebuff and injustice, and overlooking zealotry, we should seek alliance with non-Catholics for proper Sunday observance. Without going over to the Judeaic Sabbath, we can bring the masses over to the moderation of the Christian Sunday. To effect this, we must set our faces sternly against the sale of intoxicating beverages on Sunday. The corrupting influences of saloons in politics, the crime and pauperism from excessive drinking, require legislative restriction which we can aid in procuring by joining our influence with that of the other enemies of intemperance. Let us resolve that drunkenness shall be made odious, and give practical encouragement and support to Catholic temperance societies. We favor the passage and enforcement of laws rigidly closing saloons on Sunday and forbidding the sale of liquors to minors and intoxicated persons.”

Upon this Mr. Crafts remarks:—

> This does not mean that the millenium is to be built in a day. This is only a proposal of courtship, and the parties thus far have approached each other shyly.

When courtship has gotten so far along as the proposal, marriage is not far off, especially where the parties are so coy as is this species of Protestantism. And when this marriage between Protestantism and Catholicism is accomplished, what will become of the Protestant portion of the union? What kind of Protestantism is that, anyhow, which so willingly, or rather anxiously, carries on a courtship with Roman Catholics to the extent of receiving a proposal of marriage? Yes, that marriage is coming, and like every other great feature of Catholicism, it is contrary to nature—one woman marrying another. And the fruit of it will be, as pictured in the Scripture, a hideous, nondescript monster. Let there be raised up in this land a Protestantism that will assert itself not only against Roman Catholicism as such, but also against this degenerate Protestantism that has forgotten its place and its mission in the world.

The resolution “that drunkenness shall be made odious” by giving it governmental and religious sanction six days in the week, is likewise worthy of the Catholic Church.

THE organ of the American Sabbath Union says that “the opposition to Senator Blair’s Sunday-Rest bill, introduced in the United States Senate, December 9, and printed in the *Pearl of Days,* is based upon a false assumption. That bill does not assume, as it is claimed, that civil legislation upon this subject appeals to the divine law for its support. Nothing of this kind appears in the bill.” Certainly nothing of the kind appears in the bill, for it has been omitted for the express purpose of disarming opposition to the measure. It is, however, not a false assumption to say that the bill is a religious measure and that the motives of its promoters are purely religious. A careful comparison of the bill as introduced in the Fiftieth Congress and as now pending in the Fifty- first Congress will convince anyone that precisely the same object is to be accomplished by the bill as it now stands, as it was hoped to accomplish by it as originally framed. We print on another page an article from one of our exchanges which shows this so plainly that none can fail to see it.

WE notice that some of our exchanges, as well as a number of our correspondents, make the mistake of confounding the Blair Educational Bill with the Educational Amendment. These are not identical by any means. The Blair Educational *Bill *is a measure that has been advocated by Senator Blair for several years, and has passed the Senate several times. The object of this bill is to appropriate a certain amount—seventy millions, we think—from the surplus funds in the public treasury to the different States of the Union according to the proportion of illiteracy. But this bill does not propose in itself to have anything to do with religion in the public schools; it simply proposes to take some of the surplus in the public treasury and divide it amongst the States for the States to use according to their own educational systems.

The Educational *Amendment* proposed by Senator Blair, is that which we have printed and commented upon in the SENTINEL. This proposes to amend the Constitution of the United States so that the principles of Christianity shall be taught in all the public schools in the Nation.

The Educational *Bill* would become a law, and of force, merely upon the action of Congress and the approval of the President. The proposed *Amendment* would be of no force until it was approved by three-fourths of the States. We shall print soon a copy of the Blair Educational *Bill* that our readers may understand just what the intent of it is. We make these remarks just now, only for the purpose of correcting the mistake that some have made, of confounding the bill with the proposed amendment. Please don’t do it any more.

THE American Sabbath Union complains that, “New England is in peril from Sunday work and Sunday dissipation.” How can it be otherwise under Sunday laws? The effort of the Sunday-law workers is to preserve Sunday as a religious day. Secular work is not in harmony with the religious idea of the day, therefore, work is forbidden. When work is forbidden to those who are not religious they are compelled to be idle, dissipation is the sure outcome; and that also is out of harmony with the religious idea of the day. As Sunday is held to be the palladium of salvation for the State; whatever State it is that has Sunday laws will always be in peril from Sunday work and Sunday dissipation.

THE Elmira (N. Y.) *Telegram* says:—

There is no power in the Constitution of the United States to prescribe the modes and time for the religious observance of any day in the week. The people are at liberty, without restriction, or definition of duty, to worship God in their own way, according to the dictates of their own conscience. Laws cannot be built to make a man rest when he isn’t tired, or regulate the way he shall get rested when he is. [41]
