IN the United States District Court, November 4, Judge Hanford rendered an opinion in the suit brought by Catholic Bishop of Nesqually to obtain the title of 340 acres of land occupied as a military reservation by the United States Government at Vancouver, Wash. The claim brought by the plaintiff is based upon the establishment of a missionary station at Vancouver with consent of Hudson Bay Company. The property is now estimated to be worth nearly $1,000,000. The Court holds that the claims of the United States Government to the lands, as a reservation, is prior in time and for that reason, if no other, superior in equity to that of plaintiff. An appeal was taken to the United States Supreme Court. This is simply history repeating itself; favors once granted the Roman Church have invariably been subsequently demanded as rights; and in this respect many so-called Protestant bodies are not one whit behind Rome.
