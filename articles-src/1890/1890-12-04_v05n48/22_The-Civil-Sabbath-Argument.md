A LITTLE pamphlet on the Sunday question has reached our table. We are at a loss to understand why a man who professes to reverence Sunday should use such suicidal means. The book begins by claiming that the day is a *religious* Sabbath, but ends up by the oft-repeated assertion that it is not; that it is a *civil* Sabbath. The argument simply overthrows itself. It is a new form of the story about the Irish woman who didn't want to lend her tub:

"A tub is it! Sure an' I niver owned sich an article," and seeing a doubtful expression on her neighbor's face, added, "An' Saysoids, wasn't it Mrs. O'Rafferty that borried it jist this blessed minit?"
