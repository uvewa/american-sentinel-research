THE *Christian Advocate*, referring to the Louisiana Lottery, says:—

> It takes from New England more than three million dollars annually. It draws over long distances and its drafts are immense. How much does it return? If it did no other mischief than swallow the people's millions without yielding any adequate return it might be endured. The demoralization of consciences and manhood which it produces is infinitely worse.

This is a very common but a very erroneous idea. The legitimate business of the Government is to protect the persons, property, and reputation of its citizens; and to do this properly requires the prohibition of such swindling concerns as lotteries.

The fact that lotteries are demoralizing does not justify their prohibition. The same argument would justify the suppression of a great deal of literature with which probably even the *Advocate* would not insist that the State should meddle. When the State begins to regulate morals there is no place for it to stop short of absolute paternalism with all its objectionable features.
