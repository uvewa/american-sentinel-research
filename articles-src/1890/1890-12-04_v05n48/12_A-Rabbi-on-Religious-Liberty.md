[A speech delivered by Rabbi David Phillipson before the late Secular Congress at Portsmouth, Ohio. Somewhat abridged.]

THE blessings we enjoy we rarely appreciate to their fullest extent, until we are in danger of being deprived of them. Full religious liberty, and freedom of conscience is one of the greatest, if not the greatest blessing enjoyed by the people of this country. . . .

We have no favored, no recognized, no State Church. There is nothing in the Constitution of the country that can be interpreted to the advantage of any one religious denomination or to the disadvantage of any other. The land has been blessed indeed during the century and more of its existence, blessed on this very account. There has been full amity and comity before the law among all religious denominations. Nor has religion suffered, for there is no people in the world in which the religious sense is so fully developed or so deeply imbedded as in the American people.

Smoothly and without friction have the wheels of the religious life revolved in all this time, but during the past year or so strange voices are making themselves heard, and fanatics, if not hot-headed, then cool-headed ones, who are all the more dangerous on that account, urging a recognition by the Government of this country of the claims of a special religion, of Christianity. There were, during the last session of Congress three measures before the legislative bodies sitting in Washington, all having the same purpose in view, the Blair Sunday bill, and the Blair Educational Amendment before the Senate, and the Breckinridge Sunday bill before the House.

These attempts may well fill us with alarm, even though these measures did not gain the sanction of Congress, yet the very fact that they were presented shows [383] that there is danger ahead, and that among a certain portion of the community (and that no small one) sentiments are abroad which are thoroughly at variance with the intentions of the founders of the Government, and with the teachings of true religious liberty; these teachings are the complete separation of Church and State, and full freedom of every individual to worship and to think as he will.... These ideas held in the closing decades of the last century; they have held during this century, but now there appears to be a retrogression; we are seemingly going back to those darker days when one religion was recognized by the State to the exclusion of others....

Listen to this sentence from a section of one of these bills: "Each State in the Union shall establish and maintain a system of free public schools adequate for the education of all the children living therein, between the ages of six and sixteen years, inclusive, in the common branches of learning, in virtue and morality, and in a knowledge of the fundamental and nonsectarian principles of Christianity."

The fundamental and non-sectarian principles of Christianity! What are they? Those principles in which all Christians believe; a few of such principles are the divinity of Jesus, original sin, justification by faith, etc.; see you not the insidious attempt to force Christianity upon the State, and have it acknowledged as the national religion, no matter though there are hundreds of thousands who do not believe in the fundamental and non-sectarian principles of Christianity; let not that term "non-sectarian" mislead; it is not applied in a general sense, the non-sectarian principles of religion, but the non-sectarian principles of Christianity. . . .

A Government, one of whose foundation stones is this principle of the absolute separation of Church and State, may not for a moment entertain any such resolution, but it is sad to think that we have retrograded so far, that religious narrowness has found its way even into the halls of Government. What individuals do without in the different walks of life is their own concern, but when a man is elected to the Legislature of the country he becomes representative not only of the people who coincide with his private religious views, but of the people at large; and the moment he assumes these large duties, these small individualities must be laid aside, or else he is not the man for the place.

Another foundation-stone of the Government is individual liberty of action, as long as it does not interfere with the like liberty of others. This, the so-called Sunday laws tend to subvert. The Government may not officially recognize any one day upon which it prohibits freedom of action. . . These bills are obnoxious but not because they designate Sunday as the day to be particularly observed. They would be just as obnoxious if they would name the Saturday or any other day. The State may not interfere with the freedom of the individual conscience; once begun who can tell where it will end; the encroachments will grow more and more until in all probability we will get back to the old Blue Laws, which prohibited any man to walk in the field on Sunday, or to smile or listen to any music except the dreary hymns, which the gloomier they were the more religious they were supposed to be. The State has its proper work, the Church has its own sphere. "The civil power ought to be not only neutral and impartial as between different forms of faith, but ought to leave these matters entirely on one side, regarding them no more than it regards the artistic or literary pursuits of the citizens."

Such has been the policy of the Government; it is a late day now to begin to subvert it; but I believe it may truly be said that the majority of the men and women of the land protest against even the least encroachment of the State upon the religious sphere or the smallest interference with the inalienable rights of the individual conscience and thought, and if they do not so protest it only shows that the narrow-mindedness of days that we had thought long past still exists to-day. Senator Blair, for example, is not a representative of the people, but of a class of men, who, though living in the last years of the nineteenth century, belong to the spirit of the seventeenth. They must still learn, all men and women of this kind, that sectarianism is not religion, that the bond of mankind is broader than the bond of the Church, that no single body of men has any rights, as such, over any other, and that the God of mankind is much more loving than the God they profess, who is at best only the God of a sect, all others except those who believe and think with them being placed out of the pale of his regard. This sectarianism represents the spirit that breathes in every law or resolution which is brought forward in the interest of any religion in the councils of the State; this is the spirit that dominates some of our so-called statesmen at this late day.

I would like you to contrast with these expressions the words of him whom Americans honor above all men—of Washington. With a century of experience back of them the Sunday agitators and Church-in-the- State advocates see not as clearly as did the American fathers with no further experience than their own good, common sense and their mighty intentions of the right, what are the natural rights of man, what religious liberty means. Washington was what is called a good church member, being a vestryman of the Episcopal Church; but this did not blind him to the fact that there might likewise be truth in other systems, nor did it prevent him from perceiving the necessity of keeping religion out of the State, nor of according full liberty of thought, worship and action to all.

All this is the more wonderful when we remember that these men had all been British subjects, and in no country in Europe was there closer connections between Church and State than in England; also in the Colonies in this country had there been an established Church, which was recognized by the laws of the State, all the more glory and honor to them that they should see beyond the ideas in which they grew up, as it were, and free themselves from the conceptions that were so prevalent around about them. It was a wonderful age and they were wonderful men. What clearer statement has ever been made of the religious rights of man than the following words of Washington: "Every man who conducts himself as a good citizen is accountable alone to God for his religious faith, and should be protected in worshiping God according to the dictates of his own conscience." Let the latter-day apostles, who are now living, hear and take instruction from such sentiments. No word here about the fundamental and non-sectarian principles of Christianity to be taught to the children in the public schools, but each man should be protected in worshiping God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and not according to the rules and laws set and prescribed by men....

Religious liberty is the brightest jewel in the crown of American institutions; it has placed the man above the sectarian; it has placed manhood upon the highest pinnacle. God Eternal has created men of many minds; in nothing do these minds differ as much as in religious thought; each one unto himself, than, in this. Jew and Christian, agnostic and infidel, will find perfect peace and live in perfect harmony only so long as private convictions are not interfered with, only so long as the State will attend to its own, the Church to its own, as was the thought of the great Americans whose names we honor and whose thoughts, which are also our thoughts upon the subject in hand, may be gathered into the few terse words: "Religion must always be kept separate from civil government."
