"THE company of Bellamyites recently organized in Des Moines will locate," says the Nebraska *State Journal*, "at Lake Arthur, Louisiana, on a tract of 2,000 acres of land. Their experiences will be interesting, but will add nothing to the sum of human knowledge on the subject of co-operation. They may flatter themselves that their scheme is new, and will have a tremendous influence in reforming the country and converting it to Nationalism, but they are doomed to disappointment. Communism of this kind is as old as the race, and the people who join the colony are simply going back to the methods discarded by their ancestors hundreds of years ago."

Nationalism makes the State everything and the individual nothing. It is impracticable, and it is well that it is, for its adoption would mean utter stagnation in all human affairs.
