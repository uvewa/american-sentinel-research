'THE history of Protestantism has nothing to boast of over Catholics," says the *Catholic Review.* "They know very well—at least some of them do—that we can more than match them in every charge they bring against us, especially in the charge of persecution for conscience' sake. If we were so disposed we could appeal to the whole history of Protestantism, and especially to that of our Puritan forefathers, to prove conclusively that the country is in danger of the supremacy of that element." This is all too true; but it don't prove that persecution for conscience' sake is right. It is equally evil come from what source it may. Intolerance masquerading as Protestantism is just as wicked as when wearing the badge of Rome.
