THE *Independent* has the following:—

> A colporter of the American Bible Society, Penzotti, has been imprisoned in Peru, near the capital, for circulating Spanish Bibles. At the latest advices he had been lying in jail two months awaiting trial. It was his expectation when he last wrote that he would be sentenced shortly to four months or a year's imprisonment. The only crime of which he was guilty, so far as the American Bible Society has learned, was that of selling Bibles. It seems incredible that such a case should occur in any of the South American countries, and particularly in a State like Peru. In Argentine and in Chili full liberty of worship is allowed, but not yet in Peru nor in Bolivia.

Yes, it does seem strange that such an outrage upon human rights can be perpetrated in this enlightened age anywhere outside of Russia—or rather it would seem strange did we not know that in more than one State of our own glorious Union, honest, industrious, and God-fearing men have within the present year been imprisoned, not for selling Bibles, but for reading the Bible and obeying it just as it reads rather than as expounded by the dormant religious sects.
