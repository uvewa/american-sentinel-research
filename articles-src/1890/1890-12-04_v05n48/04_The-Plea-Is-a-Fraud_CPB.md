THE following is from the "piece" which Mr. Crafts is reciting to audiences in various parts of the country, from Maine to California:—

> The right arm of the American Sabbath Union is the promotion of the religious Sabbath; its left arm the preservation of the civil Sabbath. These two things—the Christian Sabbath on the one hand, and the American Sabbath on the other hand—are as distinct as my two arms, that resemble and cooperate, and yet not the same. This distinction is itself an answer to most of the objections to Sunday laws, which rest chiefly on the false assumption that Sunday laws are enforcements of a duty to God.

Let us examine a little the claim that Sunday laws are religious, not civil, and see if it is indeed a false assumption as Mr. Crafts asserts that it is. How have the courts regarded this matter?

In the case of Bramhall *vs.* Van Campen (8 Minnesota Reports, 13), Judge Flandrau, of the Supreme Court of Minnesota, gave the opinion that "the Sabbath laws of that State can have no other object than the enforcement of the fourth of God's commandments." In the Supreme Court of Texas, Judge Caldwell held that "the object of the Legislature was to forbid all secular employments on the Sabbath, not excepted in the act. The disregard of the Sabbath, the refusal to recognize it as a day sanctified to holy purposes, constitutes the offense." (Elsner *vs.* the State, 30 Texas Reports, 524.) In deciding one of these Sunday cases the Supreme Court of Alabama also said: "We do not think the design of the Legislature in the passage of the act can be doubted. It was evidently to promote morality and advance the interests of religion, by prohibiting all persons from engaging in their common and ordinary vocations." (O'Donnel *vs.* Sweeney, 5 Alabama Reports, 467. See also Wright *vs.* Geer, 1 Root, 474; Fox *vs.* Able, 2 Connecticut Reports, 548; George *vs.* George, 47 New Hampshire Reports, 27.) [379]

The "civil Sabbath" is simply the religious Sabbath enforced by civil law. Were it not for the fact that Sunday is a religious day, a day regarded as sacred by a large portion of the community, nothing would ever be heard of the "civil Sabbath." The plea is a fraud. B.
