# Let the Verdict Hasten.

IT is well that the case of R. M. King, Seventh-day Adventist, of Obion County, Tenn., is to be carried to the Supreme Court of the United States for adjudication. It will be remembered that he was heavily fined in the lower court for quietly working on his farm on Sunday; and that his defense as a Sabbath-keeper was disregarded. The decision has been sustained by the higher courts in the State, and hence the final appeal to the Supreme Court of the Nation. There have been several similar cases in which Seventhday Adventists, and Seventh-day Baptists have been thus persecuted. Prejudice and ignorance have thus combined to produce a state of things like that which existed in the Middle Ages. Such cases denote a revival of the bigotry which burned Protestants and Papists in the stormy days of the English Reformation. It seems incredible that such things can be in the last decade of the nineteenth century. They are part and parcel of the new crusade represented by the American Sabbath Union, and the attempt to save the failing fortunes of Sunday by civil law. We are glad that the highest tribunal of the Nation is to pass upon this case. Every Sabbath-keeper is directly involved in the results which are likely to flow from that decision. The whole status of the Sunday laws of the United States is also likely to be much affected, *pro* or *con*, by the verdict of the court. Let that verdict hasten.—*Sabbath *(*Baptist*)* Recorder.*
