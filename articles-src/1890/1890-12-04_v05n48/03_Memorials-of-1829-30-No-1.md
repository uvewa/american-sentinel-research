# Memorials of 1829-30. No. 1.

## A Memorial From Senator Blair’s State.

IN the interesting Sunday agitation of 1829-30, petitions, both for and against the discontinuance of Sunday mails, were sent to Congress from all parts of the country. Considerable interest was aroused, and even in Congress politicians were found to champion both causes. Several reports were written; but the most influential, and the ones receiving the approbation of Congress, were those written by Colonel Johnson, of Kentucky, afterwards Vice- President of the United States.

As the same question has been again introduced in our National Assembly by Senator Blair, of New Hampshire, whose Sunday Bill is now in the committee rooms of Congress, perhaps some of the old documents which aided so materially in the defeat of Sunday legislation sixty years ago, will be of interest to the readers of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. The first I shall send you is a memorial from Senator Blair’s own State. It reads as follows:—

> *To the Honorable, the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled:*

> The subscribers, citizens of the United States, and inhabitants of Portsmouth, in the county of Rockingham, and State of New Hampshire, having been informed that petitions have been, and are about to be presented to Congress by many of our fellowcitizens, in various sections of the country, praying that the transportation of the mail upon the first day of the week may be discontinued, we beg leave respectfully to remonstrate against granting the prayer of said petitioners, for the following, among other reasons:
> We believe that the measure proposed by said petitioners, if carried into effect, would operate unfavorably upon the interests of the Post-office Department, and would occasion much inconvenience to our citizens generally; that it would wholly fail of effecting its avowed object, and would, in the end, *injure rather than promote the cause of true religion;* that, however pure and patriotic may have been the motives in which it originated, the measure has found its support among a majority of its friends more in their zeal than in their knowledge: yet we cannot but regard the steps they are taking as movements hostile to the liberties of the people, and we are persuaded that the *original movers* of the measure designed it as a stepping-stone to more sensible inroads upon our religious privileges. By establishing the principle it involves, *they hope to silence remonstrance against their future enterprises,* and contend successfully *with weapons furnished them by Congress.*
> The supporters of the measure are sufficiently protected in their worship, and in the enjoyment of their religious privileges, by the laws of their respective States, and this is all they have a right to demand; while others are not permitted to disturb them, they should not, as we humbly conceive, be permitted to disturb others; they have not, to our knowledge, been appointed by the Almighty the defenders of his honor, or the avengers of his injuries. The experience of all ages fully testifies the deplorable consequences of arming religion with the power of the laws. Church and State were never united, [363] but the articles of their union were subsequently sealed with blood.
> In an enlightened community, blessed with free and liberal institutions, *religious despotism can only be established insensibly, and by degrees. Every approach to it should be vigilantly guarded against by the Government.* Knowing that in all ages, down to the present time, the clergy have been enterprising and ambitious, seizing eagerly upon power, and exercising it without reason and without mercy, it would be arrogance in those of the present age to claim an exemption from similar propensities; and, even were they to claim it, their claim would not be credited by careful observers of their conduct. When we consider the number, talents, and influence of this body of men, their zeal and activity, the intimate union that exists among them, and the concert with which all their movements are accomplished; the astonishing credulity of many of their adherents; the support they derive from numerous religious corporations and societies, rapidly increasing in numbers and in wealth; the almost unlimited control which they exercise over our colleges and other literary institutions, with no power but the laws, which they are ambitious to control, to watch or check them—we see reason to dread even their unassisted efforts to deprive us of our liberties; but especially should we deprecate arming them with powers which properly belong only to the people and the rulers of their choice—powers, like in other days, to tread on the necks of kings, dictate laws to nations, and murder millions with impunity. *We cannot shut our eyes to the visible fact that the clergy are the prime movers, the life and soul of the measure prayed for by the petitioners.*
> With these views and feelings, we deem it our sacred duty respectfully but solemnly, to remonstrate against the measure prayed for by said petitioners, and we feel conscious that *in so doing we shall best subserve the cause of true religion* and the interests of our beloved country.
These reasons, urged so forcibly and so successfully against Sunday legislation sixty years ago, are equally applicable today. What was the “life and soul” of that movement, is the “life and soul” of the present movement—and now, as then, the move is simply a stepping-stone to further legislation in the same line. W. A. BLAKELY.
