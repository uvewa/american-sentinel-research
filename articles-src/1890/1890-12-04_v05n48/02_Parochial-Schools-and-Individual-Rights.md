THERE is no question that the education furnished by parochial schools is generally of an inferior character, and it is a matter of regret that they should be established. The public schools do the work for the children far better. But an attempt to prevent the establishing of parochial or private schools by constitutional amendment or otherwise, would, in our opinion, be extremely unwise.... It is asking the State to do a very tyrannical and unnecessary thing. It is the right and duty of the State, undoubtedly, to provide a system of public education and to insist by compulsory laws and otherwise that all children of sound mind shall receive instruction in the rudiments of learning; but to insist that they shall not receive this instruction in private or parochial schools or at home would be to invade individual rights. The effect of such a proposition would be a hot sectarian war. It would unite Catholics solidly, and it would arouse no small proportion of Protestants to strenuous opposition. Many Lutherans believe in parochial schools and maintain them, and so do other Prottestants.—*Independent.*
