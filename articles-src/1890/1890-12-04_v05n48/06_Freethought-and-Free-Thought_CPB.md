THE following letter explains itself. We give it place as a matter of courtesy to a lady:—

> *Philadelphia, Nov. 20, 1890.*

> EDITORS AMERICAN SENTINEL:
> Your issue of November 20 contains some criticisms upon my attitude at the Portsmouth Congress of the American Secular Union,—criticisms which, despite their kindly tone (for which I thank you), call for some reply upon my part.
> You quote from my speech on "Methods of Extending Our Work," and charge me with committing our society officially to a sectarian stand in favor of infidelity.
> Allow me to say, before all, that I detest the word "infidelity," in whichever of three meanings it be taken—*i. e.,* (1) unfaithful, (2) without faith, (3) opposed to the prevailing faith of the community. The first meaning, no one who is at all acquainted with me will ever apply to me; the second, I deny emphatically, as I am a Liberal Unitarian, with a very well-defined belief; and the third, I maintain, cannot with justice be applied to any moderate non-Trinitarian Liberal, since those who *really* uphold orthodox Christianity are in the minority in this country. (See statistics in my speech.)
> As for my "declaration of war on religion," I fail to find such in a single sentence of my speech. I did, however, recommend that children be taught to realize "the evil that *priestcraft* and *religious superstition* have been from the days of savagery down." But what have these things to do with the "two great commandments" of love to God, and love to one's neighbor, which are the sum and substance of every true religion, pagan as well as Christian? You seem to object to my anxiety to prevent the young "from falling into that religious superstition which puts the cross higher than their moral duty as good citizens, and which teaches them to consider what the Church sneeringly calls 'mere morality' as of little account in the sight of the Deity whom they worship." Can it be that *you* would place church observances above your duty to the truth and to your fellow-men? Not so, gentlemen; the moral tone of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL forbids even the suggestion of such a thing.
> I did, however, recommend Freethought Sunday-schools for children, and Freethought Lyceums for young people. But what does "Freethought" mean? Simply the right to freedom of thought—the right to seek truth wherever we can find it. Is *that* irreligious? So much the worse then for that sort of religion, I should say; and I think you would agree with me. In regard to the methods which I advocated, I was careful to advance them as my personal views, not as my official utterance, as you will see if you read my speech throughout; and in delivering these parts of my address, I emphasized the personal pronoun. I took the liberty of advancing these more radical views of my own, because I knew that the majority of the delegates would expect me to outline work for the most ultra among us, as well as for the most conservative. Moreover, our people are different from yours. They are, many of them, impatient of working in [380] harness; they can do their best as scouts, as guerrillas. That I, as Secretary, should not take into consideration this class of our members, which comprises many of our most active workers, would indeed have been an official blunder. But, as for committing our society to any ism, even the ism of denouncing the church, which is the bulwark of the National Reformers, I have never done so; nor, so far as I know, am I likely to do so while I remain Secretary. Unofficially, I shall probably continue to protest against some dogmas which perhaps you and others believe in, as I do not intend to allow even our non-sectarian society to shut off my right of free speech. I trust, however, that I shall never be lacking in the parliamentary courtesy due to the opinions of those who differ with me. I trust that I shall always remain broad-minded enough to give intellectual hospitality to every earnest seeker after truth, be he Churchman or Radical.
> You are quite right in saying that the truth or falsity of the Christian religion has nothing to do with the question of separating Church and State. Nevertheless, mankind has usually been swayed by likes and dislikes, rather than by simple justice. In the case of your own organization, while your paper firmly maintains its unsectarian stand, are not most of your people upheld in their struggles against persecution by a feeling of devotion to their Master? In our own organization, numbering among its membership so many Freethinkers, Atheists and Individualists, can it be wondered that the impelling motive of the majority should be one of hostility to a church which they blame for being a hindrance to progress? Moreover, as Mr. T. B. Wakeman said at our Congress: "As long as our theological fellow-citizens will insist upon the infraction of secular Government by forcing the Bible into our public schools, chaplains into public bodies, and the exemption of churches from taxation, certainly we are bound to inquire, what are their Bible, their prayers, and their churches worth?" He also refers to the disadvantage under which we labor, in having to invite "those of extremely divergent views on every other topic except political secularization, to take part in our Congresses held for that purpose;" and he adds: "We must try to get over that difficulty by mutual intellectual and spiritual hospitality."
> Although your organization and ours are working for the total separation of Church and State from entirely different motives, the object of our struggles is the same; and I trust that the day will come when we shall co-operate effectively as allies, without any sacrifice by either of us of our impelling motives.
> We were glad to have Professor J. O. Corliss, of the National Religious Liberty Association, with us at the Congress. His ringing speech hit the nail on the head, and pleased our people generally, even where they did not agree with him from a religious standpoint. I earnestly hope that your people will be represented at next year's Congress also. Meanwhile, let us hold out a helping hand to one another in the good work wherever we can, even though we be not ready to become formal allies. And last, but not least, please remember that the officers of the American Secular Union, whatever their private or personal views, commit themselves and the society officially to the promulgation of no ism whatever.
> With best wishes for the success of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL in its noble work, I am
> Yours very truly,
> IDA C. CRADDOCK,
> *Cor. Sec. American Secular Union.*

We have no extended comments to make upon this letter; but we must say that we cannot see that we did Miss Craddock any injustice in our criticism upon her utterances at Portsmouth. Our use of the term "infidel" is justified by common usage, and by Webster's definition of the word. It means "one who is without faith, or unfaithful; hence, a disbeliever, a freethinker," etc. A freethinker, Webster says, is "one who disregards revelation; an unbeliever." The synonyms are "infidel, skeptic." Moreover, freethinkers themselves use the word "infidel." Our correspondent should go to the root of the matter and change the facts, the dictionary, and the practice of the world at large, before finding fault with us; if she is a freethinker she is also an infidel, however much she may dislike the name.

"Freethought" is not a dictionary term, but according to the usage of freethinkers themselves it is a synonym for infidelity. The assumption that freedom of thought is "freethought" is unwarranted. The Christian is just as free to think, and thinks to quite as good purpose as the freethinker; there is "freethought" and free thought; but they differ in this, that while the former implies disbelief, or skepticism, the latter means free exercise of the mind.

We would not place "church observances" above duty to the truth and to our fellow-men, but we do say that faith in Christ is essential to the perfect discharge of these duties. Miss Craddock, in common with other freethinkers, would doubtless dissent from this proposition as she has a perfect right to do. We criticise her only because such suggestions have no proper place in the Secular Union if it is unsectarian. The Union though not a party is a political organization to influence the State in the direction of secularism; and "secularism" does not mean opposition to Christianity, it simply means opposition to union of Church and State, or religion and the State. But when the Secular Union arrays itself against Christianity and devises plans for the instruction of the youth in "freethought" it really assumes to array the State against Christianity. The Secular Union agrees with us that the State has no right to favor Christianity; is it not equally true that the State has no right to antagonize Christianity?

Miss Craddock can no more separate herself from her office, and as an individual outline work for the radical members of the Union, than the American Sabbath Union can separate Sunday from the religious sentiment that sustains it, and transform it into a civil institution.
