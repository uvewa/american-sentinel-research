A LONDON secular paper remarks that "it is hardly fair that a ship-owner who encourages his crew to respect Sunday should suffer in the competitive struggle," and says that the Government should "secure for all alike the rest and quiet which in the self-governing Colonies is enforced by law."

Commenting upon this, the *Present Truth,* an English religious paper, says: "That is, compel men who do not believe, so that those who do will have no sacrifices to make, and will not suffer in the competitive struggle. This would be compensation with a vengeance. That religious papers should be making such appeals as this is not a hopeful sign of the times. They only show how utterly antagonistic to the spirit of the gospel is the spirit of Sunday laws and all other religious legislation."
