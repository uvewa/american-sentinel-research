THE *Mail and Express* says editorially that "the Sabbath is emphatically an American institution." We had supposed that it was a divine institution; certainly that is true of the Bible Sabbath, but there may be a Sabbath that is an American institution; if so, that fact would explain the demand for laws to maintain it; every country of course should bolster up its own institutions.
