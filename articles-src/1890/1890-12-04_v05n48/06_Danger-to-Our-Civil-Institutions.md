# Danger to Our Civil Institutions.

THE common sense of the people sees very plainly that if religious instruction is introduced, the school system as it is cannot remain. It will be broken up and church schools substituted. There will be Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, and infidel schools, and each division will have to support its own. The proposition has been made that the school fund be distributed among Catholics and Protestants according to their numbers; but the State can make no such religious discrimination. A great part of the population, also, are of no religious belief and convictions, and the number of Jewish children in the schools is large, much larger proportionately than the number of Jews in town. Neither is there any agreement among Protestants as to what is the true religion to teach. Schools that would suit Episcopalians would not suit Baptists and Methodists. If there is to be any religious instruction, each party will demand that it be after its own tenets. Each wants to hold its own children in its own fold, for on them chiefly depends the perpetuation of its strength.

The only way to escape discord is to keep the instruction purely secular, and it is the only course consistent with our theory of Government. Otherwise we should have to give up the public school system altogether, and turn over education to private enterprise wholly. If there were as much dissatisfaction with this divorce of religion among parents generally as there is among theologians, such a result would be unavoidable. The people would not support the public schools. But the census every autumn shows that there is no such popular discontent. In spite of many Catholic and Protestant parish schools, the public school-houses are not large enough and numerous enough to hold the children who are sent to them. The great mass of the people seem to take no interest in the discussion which is so active in many religious quarters. They are not disturbed because religion is out of the schools.—*New York Sun.*
