REV. NATHANIEL W. CONKLING, D.D., writes a letter to the New York *Observer*,* *descriptive of Alaska and some of its people, in which speaking of the Metlakahtla Indians, he says:—

> These so-called Indians are Christianized. Mr. Duncan acts in the belief that to educate them without Christianizing them is to give them a bane rather than a blessing. All information goes to show that they are consistent Christians. In this Sabbathless country, every Metlakahtla Indian who makes a contract to work in mines, canneries, or forest, insists on the distinct agreement that he does no work on Sundays.

Who can doubt that these Indians are altogether more self-reliant and better able to meet all temptation under such circumstances than they would had they been hedged around with a Sunday law, and required to keep the day to avoid arrest and imprisonment? The fact that these Christianized Indians keep Sunday in a country where there is no law requiring them to do so, shows that others could keep it also if they were only sufficiently Christianized to be willing to practice a little self-denial, and suffer loss if necessary, rather than violate their conscientious convictions of duty.
