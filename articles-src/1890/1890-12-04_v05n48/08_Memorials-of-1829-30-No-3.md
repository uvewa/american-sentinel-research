## Principles Involved In Sunday Legislation.

> "*To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress Assembled*:—

"The memorial of the subscribers, residing in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, respectfully showeth:

"That they approach the Supreme Legislature of their county, not for the purpose of infringing on the privileges of others, but to secure that liberty which, in their apprehension, is now endangered. When these United States became independent of the British crown, and assumed their just station among the sovereign States of the earth, the delegates appointed to represent the different provinces were not unmindful of the great trust confided to them by the people. To guard against any abuse in matters of religion and civil policy, the wise framers of the Constitution of our Government, after defining with unexampled accuracy the rights of the citizens, and limiting the authority of Congress, expressly prohibited the latter from interfering with the religious opinions of the people.

"Your memorialists have, therefore, regarded with abhorrence the diligent and untiring efforts of a combination of religious sects, made to obtain an ascendancy in the administration of public affairs. To them, it is obvious that *the ultimate object* proposed to be attained is the *recognition by Congress of certain specific doctrines*, and thereby to enslave the consciences of the free citizens of this great Republic. It is now contemplated to fill all the public offices with men who shall, either directly or indirectly, accept the faith and doctrine of a powerful party. The subject of which they now speak, the memorialists are aware, has frequently been the occasion of much painful thought to some of the most eminent statesmen who have adorned our country with the luster of their talents.

"Your memorialists regret the necessity which compels them to intrude on your deliberations at the present juncture. Silence upon their part would be construed into approbation of the measures pursued by those whom they are resolved to op pose. They will, therefore, address you in language suited to the emergency, and with a sense of the responsibility thus voluntarily assumed.

"At the last session of your body, great efforts were made to induce you to pass a law, the object of which was to suspend the transmission of the mails on what is called the Sabbath. But a patriotic Legislature then decided that it was incompetent for them to approach an undetermined question in religion. It was with great astonishment your memorialists heard that the attempt was again to be renewed, and a new attack to be made [381] on the rights of conscience. They have received with sorrow the information that petitions are daily presented to both houses of Congress in relation to the present mail establishment. *To have proposed an open union of Church and State would have been so manifest a violation of republican principle, as must have drawn upon its authors the just resentment of an indignant people. But the subject now adopted as suitable for the legislation of Congress, can be discussed with less danger and *WITH AN EFFECT EQUALLY CERTAIN.

"Your memorialists have in vain endeavored to discover any reasonable motive for the selection of the Sabbath as peculiarly proper for legislative support. There is no small diversity of opinion among mankind regarding the propriety of keeping one day in seven holy. The Jews, and some sects of Christians, aver that the *seventh*, and not the *first* day of the week, is the true Sabbath. A large number of pious persons believe that the Jewish Sabbath, with its ceremonial observances, has been abolished; and that, in its place, the first day of the week must be held equally sacred. Another class of mankind maintain that the institution is utterly abrogated, and that neither day should be observed.

"Your memorialists believe that if Congress possess the power to designate what day shall be the Sabbath, and to define its appropriate duties, it would be equally within the scope of their authority to decide other disputed points. If the Constitution has imposed on Congress the duty of discriminating what mode of faith shall be adopted, it must, as a consequence, give the power to compel obedience. Hence all the religious obligations of men must become the subject of legislation to the ruin of families and the destruction of personal comfort and convenience; for if the law can enforce *one* religious duty, it can, by parity of reasoning, insist on the performance of *all.*

"Your memorialists would say that, when the Congress of the United States shall prefer an arrogant and domineering clergy, heaping upon them privileges and immunities not enjoyed by other citizens, then will be formed *as powerful an ecclesiastical establishment as can be found in any other nation on earth.* The doctrines of the favored party will then become the creed of the country, to be enforced by fines, imprisonment, and perhaps death.

"The historian Gibbon utters an important warning upon this point. He says: "It is encumbent on the authors of persecution previously to reflect whether they are determined to support it in the last extreme. They excite the flame which they strive to extinguish; and it soon becomes necessary to chastise the contumacy, as well as the crime, of the offender. The fine which he is unable or unwilling to discharge, exposes his person to the severities of the law; and his contempt of lighter penalties suggests the use and propriety of *capital punishment*."* Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, chap. 37, Par. 23.*

"Superstition and bigotry will paralyze the steps of genius, and, the further improvement of our now happy country must be suspended. If the sun of her glory shall now set, it will, perhaps, never again rise to cheer a benighted world with the splendor of its rays.

"Your memorialists would further represent that, in their present appeal to the justice and magnanimity of the constituted authorities of their country, they are actuated by no irreverent motive. Nor do they cherish other than feelings of respect for their fellow-citizens who differ from them in sentiment. They do not ask you to throw any impediment in the path of those who, in sincerity of heart, would worship the God of their fathers. Their design in now appearing before you is to preserve the liberty of conscience inviolate; and to ask that the Constitution of the Government may not be infringed in this particular.

"On no consideration would they wish to restrain the right of free discussion in relation to the matter now pending before you. That liberty they ask for themselves, they devoutly desire may be enjoyed by all mankind. They are, however, aware that the Sabbath is a part of the Jewish law, and it is for that people to advocate its sanctity. These are, however, satisfied in the enjoyment of their own rights, without intruding on those of others. The declaration has gone forth from a sect of Christians, that the due observance of the Sabbath is essential to the moral health and existence of the Nation. They have arrogantly usurped the right to determine in what the Sabbath shall consist, without having the least regard for those who conscientiously differ from them.

"Your memorialists have considered the importance of your deliberations to the welfare of the Nation, and that something more than an ordinary occurrence is necessary to justify them in thus obtruding on your attention. Their inclinations would have induced them to keep silence, had they not felt themselves urged by a sense of imperious duty to oppose the daring schemes of the day. The zeal with which the plans of different sectaries have been prosecuted, and the pertinacity of design manifested by their continuing to force their views of religion on the people, must be accepted as an apology. The great political doctrine, that all men have a natural right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their consciences, is now denied. It is said that religion requires compulsory laws for its security, and the extension of its influence over the conduct and characters of men. The truth of this position is denied in the most unqualified manner by those who now address you. They are clearly of this opinion that there is no just cause of complaint on the part of the petitioners, and that their intolerant zeal has evidently destroyed their judgment.

"Your memorialists feel no disposition to submit to compulsion in matters which rest exclusively between themselves and the God who made them. Besides the attempt now being made on Congress, numerous other arbitrary measures have been adopted, with the intention of holding up to public odium those who cannot think in conformity with the doctrines avowed by your petitioners. Whatever fanaticism may have anticipated in former days, or zealous bigots in the present may predict, no great danger is to be feared of the stability of our Government, except from the combinations of a corrupt clergy. More than half a century has elapsed since the day when a large and fruitful Nation was given to the world. The prosperity of our country is unparalleled in the annals of history; peace and plenty have united to bless her inhabitants. Every description of creeds and endless varieties of faith have their votaries, and flourish under the protection of a generous system of laws. Learned institutions are encouraged and thrive among us; and there is reason to believe that the hour is rapidly advancing in which every individual in our extensive territory will be properly qualified to exercise the great functions to which he is eligible. From Maine to Mexico, and from the Atlantic to the Western wilds, the same smiling scene is displayed.

"Your memorialists would inquire if, in this general prosperity, the friends of religion and morality have any well- founded cause of discouragement? The countless evils that must flow from the least interference of the general Government with the view of favoring a religious party are such as, in their consummation, would prove destructive to our national existence. It is impossible, on an occasion like the present, not to advert to the misery which has flowed from the assumption of ecclesiastical dominion in other countries. There are regions where persecution even now erects her blood-stained banner, and demands unnumbered victims for her unholy service. The past history of the Church furnishes a melancholy demonstration of the danger to be anticipated from an alliance of the ministers of religion with the civil magistracy. There is no language which can adequately describe the abuses which have been practiced, the diabolical cruelty which has been perpetrated, and the immense amount [382] of suffering which has been inflicted, under the plea of defending the cause of religion. The beauty of youth, the venerable decrepitude of old age, and the power of rank, were equally incompetent to relax the iron grasp of the Church.

"Your memorialists would also suggest that the liberal provision made by our Constitution for the exercise of individual rights, and the encouragement given to enterprise and talent, have invited to our shores multitudes of honest and ingenious artists. Fleeing from persecution in the land of their nativity, they have sought a home in the only country under heaven where liberty can be said to dwell. Here they calculated to be delivered from those galling restrictions which had rendered existence wretched; and here they have not, as yet, been disappointed. We owe it to them, as well as to ourselves, to employ every energy to perpetuate our excellent Government, and to defend it from the attacks of insidious enemies.

"Your memorialists repose, with the fullest confidence, in the wisdom and integrity of their representatives in Congress. They cannot, however, leave the subject without the expression of their sincere approbation of the manner in which the question now under consideration was disposed of in the last session of your body. They would, therefore, respectfully ask that, not only should the prayer of the petitioners be rejected, but that such order shall be taken on the question as will forever preclude its revival."
