THE *Mail and Express* says:—

> Let the pure religious fire caught from heaven by the clean hands of the fathers ever brightly burn upon the altar of American liberty. May every foreigner, who visits our shores of freedom during the World's Fair, return home with the conviction that true religious devotion is not only compatible with, but essential to, the highest form of individual independence, and national liberty.

But what becomes of "individual independence" if the individual is so hedged about by civil law that he has no independence?
