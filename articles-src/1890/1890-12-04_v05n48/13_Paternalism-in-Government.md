THE pretension is always set up in behalf of arbitrary government that the ruler can do better for the people than they can do for themselves. This idea of paternalism in government was discarded by our fathers when they ordained for themselves and their posterity that they would be a self-reliant, self-supporting, self-governing people. Under our theory of government the people are no more dependent on their rulers and law-givers for their support in their industrial pursuits than they are for food and clothing, or for their consciences and their religious creeds—*Senator Morgan.*
