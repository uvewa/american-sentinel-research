# A Question.

IN Brooklyn, N. Y., four persons were convicted and fined from $100 to $500, for refusing to give to certain children medicine prescribed by physicians, choosing rather to treat the children by other means. They were people who believe in the "faith cure," and the children died, hence, the prosecution and the punishment. This has caused much discussion in the public press, some taking one side and others the other. All that we shall say just at this time is simply to inquire, How would it do to impose such a fine upon those who do not believe in this method of treatment—the doctors for instance—every time they lose a case? [47-48]
