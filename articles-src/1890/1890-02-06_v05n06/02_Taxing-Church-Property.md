# Taxing Church Property.

WHETHER we like it or not, the drift of political sentiment is everywhere in the direction of taxing church property the same as any other.

This was. expressed in the constitutional convention in Washington Territory by the adoption of a clause forbidding the release of any kind of property from its proportionate share of the public burdens. The object of this was the taxation of churches, private schools, and charitable institutions.

California has had a similar provision for several years in its Constitution. Though at first opposed by a large minority, it has grown in popularity until it is now accepted as a matter of course even by the most thorough-going churchmen. Some of them express the belief that the poorer churches should be exempt, but this simply corresponds to the opinion held by many political thinkers (among them ex-Secretary McCulloch) that all small property holdings should be exempt.. So far as the costly city churches are concerned, the sentiment favoring their taxation is almost unanimous.

In the Eastern States the sentiment against exemption is also growing, though in a less marked degree. It is in the main confined to political students, and to the more strenous supporters of the public school system who oppose the education of a part of the children in parochial schools. Not until all church property is taxed, they maintain, can we make sure that all our children shall have a common education in the principles of American citizenship and be united in sentiment and sympathies.

Curiously enough,; England has taken an important step in the same direction. Only a short time since a considerable sum was bequeathed to a foreign missionary society, and the executors under the will claimed that it should be exempt from the tax upon bequests. Lord Chief Justice Coleridge decided that the probable excellence of the charity in no way lessened the claims of the State. The amount of the tax on the bequest was the State’s money and not the testator’s. To remit it was to increase by just so much the burden upon the remaining taxpayers. Such an increase of the public burdens could not take place except by the direction of the public itself. No exemption could therefore be permitted.

In the same way it might be maintained that in this country, where all private property is held subject to a lien for annual-taxes on the part of thé State, the value of this lien is in fact public property. To remit the tax when the property is transferred to a religious institution, is therefore to increase the amount of the charity out of the pockets of the remaining taxpayers. Such, at least, is the philosophy of the refusal of California and Washington to exempt the property of religious and charitable institutions. It is the logical carrying out of two American principles: First, the complete separation of Church and State; second, equality before the laws for property as well as men.— *Commercial Advertiser.*
