A BEAUTIFUL illustration of the benefit which the Church derives from an alliance with the State is presented in the case of the English Marquis of Ailesbury, who is the patron of twenty-one church livings in the Established Church, while at the same time he is debarred from all English race-tracks for cheating.— *Review and Herald.*
