# National Reform Work in Cincinnati.

January 20, 21, there was held in the city of Cincinnati, a "Christian Convention," to consider "what can and ought to be done to save our land from the rising tide of vice and immorality." While ostensibly held in response to a call signed by eighty-two persons, of whom seventy-three were ministers, the fact that not one in ten of these persons were present, and that the convention was presided over by Rev. J. M. Foster, secretary of the National Reform Association, and attended by such men as Rev. Sylvester Scovel, Rev. D. McAllister, and Rev. W. F. Crafts, shows it to have been held in the interests of the National Reform movement.

The real work of the convention, apart from a two-days' exhibition of oratory and sophistry, is expressed in the following preamble and resolutions which were unanimously adopted and will in due time be presented before the Legislature at Columbus:—

> It must be admitted that God, the Supreme lawgiver and Judge, is the source of all civil authority and will surely punish all who persistently dispise his authority; as he has declared in his word. 'The Nation and kingdom that will not serve me shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted. ' A truth time and again recognized by the early statesmen of our Government, by our legislators and by Congress as late as 1863, when the Senate of the United States resolved that devoutly recognizing the authority and just government of Almighty God in all the affairs of men and nations, and sincerely believing that no people, however strong in the justness of their cause, can prosper without his favor.

> This convention is fully convinced that vice, morality and crime in any community destroy its happiness and material prosperity, and it is equally true of States and nations, and since a disregard of the Sabbath and other moral laws of God—laws which belong to the State as well as the churches—is one of the factors in promoting these vices, immoralities and crimes, we regard it as of the utmost importance that the States, in the interest of good government and the prosperity of the people, should especially protect the Sabbath as a day of rest; therefore.
> *Resolved,* That our Constitution and laws should be freed from all ambiguities which obscure their meaning and thereby give encouragement to the practice of vice and crime and render it difficult to enforce the penalties of violated laws.
> *Resolved,* That the laws on our statute-books in reference to protecting the Sabbath as a rest day should be faithfully enforced all the more as they are in the interest of the whole people.
> *Resolved,* That this convention hereby petitions the General Assembly of Ohio to amend the laws relating to our police court juries so as to bring them into line with the laws selecting juries for our county courts.
> *Resolved,* That this convention cannot but reprobate in the strongest terms the disregard of the sanctity of the judicial oath and the principles which have heretofore made trial by jury the bulwark of personal liberty, by juries, which, contrary to admitted evidence of guilt, have, nevertheless, acquitted culprits because they did not approve of the laws which they had violated.
A glance at some of the papers read will suffice to show the spirit in which these resolutions were conceived, and the sophistry of the arguments employed.

The paper read by Judge M. B. Hagans was a prominent feature of the first day's programme. He started out to consider the subject of "The Civil Sabbath," but soon branched off into history, carrying his hearers back 2,500 years to the time of Nehemiah, and thereby surprised the thinking portion of his audience, who must have wondered what Nehemiah or anyone else living in his time knew about a "civil" Sabbath. He referred to the action of Nehemiah in closing the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day and threatening to lay hands on Sabbath desecrators,—an argument having no possible bearing upon the subject of a "civil" Sabbath, since Nehemiah did this, not to protect the poor laboring men from the slavery of their Sabbath toil; but to enforce the observance of the Sabbath as a religious institution, lest they bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the Sabbath. It is to the religious side of the question that the advocates of a "civil" Sabbath always gravitate in their arguments. Judge Hagans needs to be informed that we are not now living under a theocracy, and have no one to stand in the place of Nehemiah, unless we concur with Mr. Crafts in the idea that "the preachers are the successors of the prophets,"—a theory which it would greatly stretch the credulity of most of us to accept.

The idea that the Sabbath should be enforced because it has a place in the common law of the land, was another boomerang which the Judge hurled at the opposers of a "civil Sabbath." Did the Puritans, from whose legislative efforts our Sunday laws have descended, enact those laws in the interests of a "civil Sabbath"? Did the Church of England, from which the Puritans obtained their legislative ideas ever do this? Did the Roman Catholic Church, from which the Church of England sprang, ever demand legislation in regard to a "civil" Sabbath? Everybody knows better. Our Sunday laws are the relics of an age when Church and State were united, and Sunday was enforced as a religious institution, and this stamps them as religious laws, appropriately included in our [44] statute books under the head of "offenses against God and religion." Such is the genealogy of our present Sunday laws, which Judge Hagans and others of similar bias would like to see enforced under the guise of "civil" regulations. Under the inspiration of his theme the Judge sighed for mayors in our great cities, like Nehemiah who was not troubled with police boards and the jury system, but was himself mayor and chief of police at the same time,—a sigh which will not be extensively echoed among the people of those cities, or the officers of our municipal corporations.

Rev. John Pearson read an able paper on "The Minister and His Responsibility for Public Sentiment," and, unconsciously perhaps, hit the National Reform theory a blow squarely between the eyes. Ministers of the gospel and churches were not, he said, to come down from their high position to take part in the battle of politics, but to stand as watchmen on the walls of Zion, speaking out loud and boldly on all questions which concern public morals. This they ought to do, and the place for them to do it is in the pulpit. But the trouble is that ministers preach smooth things there, and then call on the legislatures to do the work they leave undone, by compelling people to be moral by law. Such preachers would do well to read over and study the great commission under which they profess to be working: "Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, *teaching* [not compelling] them to observe all things, whatsoever I have commanded you." This defines the legitimate sphere of the Christian minister, and when he becomes an advocate of compulsory morality, he is engaging in a work which Christ has never commanded or sanctioned.

Rev. G. W. Lasher read a paper on "The Sabbath and the Working Man," repeating the familiar arguments relative to man's physical, mental, and moral need of a Sabbath rest, considering the subject from the standpoint merely of a physical and moral necessity, of which the civil law might properly take cognizance. The effect of his effort was seriously marred at the close when the Rev. Mr. Pearson arose and reminded the assembly that that was a Christian convention, that the good old- fashioned religious Sabbath was what they were principally concerned with, and that the "civil" Sabbath had been dinned in their ears quite as much as was profitable.

"A Legal Argument against Secular Common Schools," was the title of a paper read by Dr. McAllister, editor of the *Christian Statesman.* He ignored the position of parent or guardian as the overseer and inculcator of morals upon the minds of youth, and relegated this duty entirely to the State. The oath which the State demanded of its jurors and public officers furnished, in his view, a convincing reason why the public schools should instruct the youth concerning the nature of an oath, and concerning that Supreme Being of whom it makes mention. Upon this slim foundation did he build his "legal argument against secular common schools." He even went so far as to assert that secularism, to be consistent, would be compelled to rule out Webster's Dictionary; as if there were no difference between defining the existing conceptions of religious things, and inculcating religious ideas! He would have the principles of Christianity openly taught in the public schools, which would leave to the Jew and the infidel, who did not wish their children thus taught, the happy alternative of withdrawing their children from the institutions they are taxed to support, or of building up schools of their own in that fair country to which the Rev. E. B. Graham, a co-laborer of Dr. McAllister's, referred when he said, "If the opponents of the Bible do not like our Government and its Christian features, let them go to some wild, desolate land, and in the name of the devil, and for the sake of the devil subdue it, and set up a government of their own on infidel and atheistic principles, and then if they can stand it stay there till they die!"

Rev. W. F. Crafts arrived during the concluding part of the session, and spoke on "The National Sabbath." He maintained, among other things, that the rest-day must be a common day for all, ignoring the fact that communities of seventh-day and first-day observers exist together in many places without causing the slightest friction of the wheels of commerce, and said that it was an act of great generosity on the part of the States to exempt Seventh-day observers from the penalties of the Sunday laws. Such an exemption he evidently did not sanction. He would have all Sunday work of every kind stopped, except works of mercy and necessity (which he would want the privilege of defining), in order that the poor laboring men might enjoy their Sunday rest. One cannot help wondering why, if they are so enslaved and oppressed by Sunday work, there has never been a "strike" made by them for that rest. There have been strikes enough for almost everything else, but no strike for Sunday rest has ever been put on record. On the contrary, the laboring men have to be earnestly importuned by Mr. Crafts before they will indorse, and then not unanimously, the movement for a national Sunday law.

Space forbids the mention of other papers and speakers, in some instances able and interesting, but which did not touch so directly upon the subject of a State religion. The convention was thinly attended, about one hundred being present on an average, a large proportion of whom were women. Its effect upon the city and the State remains to be disclosed. L. A. SMITH.
