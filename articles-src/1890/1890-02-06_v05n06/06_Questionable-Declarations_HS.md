# Questionable Declarations.

THE following extract from a letter to the New York *Voice,* raises a very pertinent question for the consideration of the Prohibition party, if it is indeed prohibition that that party desires. The extract runs thus:—

To the *Voice.*—The letter from a correspondent, W. H. Wilgus, in a late issue of the *Voice,* brings up one of the most important questions the Prohibition party has yet to meet. Is there any better time than the present to meet it frankly and honestly?

Judging from the platforms adopted by various States this fall the Prohibition party now stands for prohibition and religious legislation. The last is an expression that ought to be hateful to every true American. But is it too strong in this case?

These platforms call upon the State to defend the sanctity of the Sabbath in varying phrases, but to the same intent. Now, the Sabbath is purely a religious institution, and it does not alter the case to substitute the word Sunday, or call for a "civil Sabbath."

The expression is self-contradictory. The province of civil government is to prohibit that which is uncivil, but it cannot be shown that honest labor on any day of the week is "uncivil," except by allowing the religious character of the day to be taken into the account, and then the State steps outside of its proper sphere of action. However, this phase of the question needs no discussion now, for there is no effort made to conceal the fact that it is the protection of Sunday as a religious institution which is desired...

But what if we exempt the minority from the operation of such laws? That is simply to tolerate them; and toleration is a word hateful to every true American. It does not make such legislation right; it admits the right of the majority to rule in matters of conscience; and last but not least, it does not work satisfactorily, and will inevitably lead to a repeal of the exemption clause. Our papers are strangely silent in regard to these facts and on this question; but certainly no side issue will cause such division as this, for it involves a matter of conscience:

Already the beginning of this defection is apparent. The recent formation of the National Religious Liberty Association is a straw which shows, too well, what we may expect in the near future. Here is an association, composed of Christian men, heartily in favor of prohibition, loyal to our Constitution, and yet compelled by earnest convictions to unite in defense of religious liberty, and oppose the Prohibition party because of its stand on this question.

It is nonsense to invite to full party fellowship those who are agreed with us on [45] the main issue while such declarations in favor of religious legislation are found in our party platforms as have recently been made.
