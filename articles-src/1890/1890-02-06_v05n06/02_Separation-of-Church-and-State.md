> No intelligent man will condemn our churches as long as they are kept entirely distinct and separate from the State. But every Republican and every Democrat, every American should resent to the bitter end every attempt of any church to mix "things spiritual and things temporal," to join Church and State, or to make laws to compel men to conform to any code of morals.—*Topeka Republican.*
