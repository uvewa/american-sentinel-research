# Religious Liberty in Rhode Island, 1636.

UNLIKE the other American Colonies, Rhode Island enjoyed the privileges of entire liberty of conscience from the time of the foundation of the commonwealth. Roger Williams, its founder, believed that God alone had to do with the heart of man, and that it was "unlawful for the magistrate to meddle with the breaches of the first table" *(i. e.,* with violations of the four first commandments, which have only to do with our relation to God). Accordingly, he founded the first commonwealth the world had ever known on the principles of individual right of conscience; and may be justly called The First American, which title does him more honor than if he had held the highest office the Colonies could afford.

From the publications of the Narragan- sett Historical Society, I take the following:—

> Roger Williams, says Professor Gervinus, in his recent "Introduction to the History of the Nineteenth Century," founded, in 1636, a small new society in Rhode Island, upon the principles of entire liberty of conscience, and the uncontrolled power of the majority in secular concerns. . . . The theories of freedom in Church and State taught in the schools of philosophy in Europe, were here brought into practice in the government of a small community. It was prophesied that the democratic attempts to obtain universal suffrage, a general elective franchise, annual parliaments, entire religious freedom, and the Miltonian right of schism, would be of short duration. But these institutions have not only maintained themselves here, but have spread over the whole Union. They have superseded the aristocratic commencements of Carolina and New York, the high-church party in Virginia, the theocracy in Massachusetts, and the monarchy throughout America; they have given laws to one quarter of the globe; and, dreaded for their moral influence, they stand in the background of every democratic struggle in Europe.

The founder of Rhode Island not only believed in every individual having the right of conscience, but he believed in every individual (the Indian as well as the white man) having *all* his inalienable rights. Consequently, he contended that the patent from the king, depriving the Indian of his land without his consent thereto, was sinful; and hence, like Penn, he purchased his land from the native inhabitants. His study of the teachings of Christ (for he was a devoted Christian and close Bible student) gave him a clear understanding of the inherent rights of mankind and the proper sphere of government. It was Christ himself who said, "My kingdom is not of this world"; and "Render, therefore, unto Cesar the things which are Cesar's, and unto God the things that are God's."

George Bancroft, justly meriting the eminence which he has gained for his critical and diligent research, as well as graphical description, truly says:—

> The annals of Rhode Island, if written in the spirit of philosophy, would exhibit the forms of society under a peculiar aspect. Had the territory of the State corresponded to the importance and singularity of the principles of its early existence, the world would have been filled with wonder at the phenomena of its history.

Again, the historian says:—

> The land which was now [1636] occupied by Williams, was within the territory of the Narragansett Indians; it was not long before an Indian deed [dated March 24, 1638] made him the undisputed possessor of an extensive domain. Nothing displays more clearly the character of Roger Williams than the use which he made of his acquisition of territory. The soil he could claim as his own, as truly as any man's coat upon his back; and he reserved to himself not one foot of land, not one tittle of political power, more than he granted to servants and strangers. He gave away his lands and other estate to them that he thought were most in want, until he gave away all. He chose to found a commonwealth in the unmixed forms of a pure democracy, where the will of the majority should govern the State, yet "only in civil things." God alone was respected as the ruler of conscience.

Thus it was that the grand institutions of the great American Republic had their birth. These principles were afterward fostered and encouraged by various commonwealths, and by such men as Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and their fellow-statesmen; and, finally found a place in the Constitution of the United States of America.

Well may the American people feel proud of their country. And every freeman should watch with a jealous eye, lest these principles, which have raised this nation above any other nation on the face of the globe, should be set aside, and our national Government, even yet, legislate upon the subject of religion. W. A. BLAKELY.
