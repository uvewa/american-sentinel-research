# Pertinent Questions.

IN the Sunday issue of the *Tribune* of this city there is a department entitled "In the Church Porch," in which much sound doctrine is dispensed,— the following, for instance, which we commend to Joseph Cook and others who in the attempt to justify their demand that the State shall teach religion, so innocently exclaim that so many of the people "never see the inside of a church":—

> "Did Jesus preach his gospel in a big and well-appointed church in High Street, Jerusalem? Did he announce that those who desired to hear him must go there; or did he rather go where the sinners were and there preach to them? Preach to them? I recall the word. He did better than preach; he entered into the lives of sinners; he learned what their burden of sorrow or trouble was and tried to lighten it. He came to them not as a professional preacher, but as a friend and brother. And if the modern church would succeed it must go and do likewise.

> "Take an illustration. Here is a great physician, and here are a multitude of sick folk needing his skill. But instead of going to the homes of these sick folk and trying to cure them by suggesting remedies appropriate to their special cases, he erects a big hall, and gives a course of learned and brilliant weekly lectures on the importance of believing in, and supporting the State Medical Society. Do you think the sick people would go to these lectures to be cured of their sickness? But maybe the physician would describe in his lectures the true nature of disease and the manifold resources of medical science. Maybe he would show how frequently people brought sickness on themselves by their vices or their ignorance. Would that help the sick people? Not at all. No matter how comfortable his lecture-hall might be, no matter how beautiful the music of his choir might be, no matter how eloquent his lecture might be, those who were sick in their wretched homes, or on the streets, would still remain sick, until he went to them individually, and gave them medicine to heal their sickness.

> "What say you to this, brother preachers, who expect sin-sick souls to be cured by listening to your eloquent sermons on the importance of joining the church, or on some abstruse scheme of theology? Would it not be wiser to go to these men and women and personally give them the medicine which will cure their special sickness? Not that preaching is to be ignored. Oh, no. It is one of the greatest functions of Christianity. But it cannot take the place of sympathetic ministration to individual souls, which, more than anything else, is needed to-day in our great cities. To vast multitudes of men and women, parochialism, with its cast-iron methods, is an utter and complete failure. Would it not, therefore, be wise for the Church to try some other more simple and direct plan?" [63-64]
