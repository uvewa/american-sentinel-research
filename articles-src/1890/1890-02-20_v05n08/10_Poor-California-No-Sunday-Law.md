# Poor California—No Sunday Law.

REV. ASELM H. BROWN, writing from San Francisco to the *Christian Intelligencer,* on the "Moral Conflicts on the Pacific Coast," says of the Sunday:—

> From careful observation and study of the churches, I believe the Sabbath [Sunday] is observed here by the resident Americans as faithfully as it is observed in other States by the same class of people. California has no Sabbath law, but such a law where it exists is not generally enforced. Christian people would like to have one, and mean to secure it and enforce it. But, although without it, the Sabbath [Sunday] is by no means obliterated as a day of rest,—tourists from the East, among whom are many professing Christians are not as careful as they should be in observing it.

And then he mentions the example set by a distinguished clergyman and minister who was connected with a board of missions. Of the latter, one person said that "Mr. Ingersoll would not probably have set a worse example in breaking the Sabbath day."

With reference to this testimony, we would note the following points: 1. It is in harmony with others which have been borne (Mr. Crafts to the contrary, notwithstanding) that Sunday is as well observed by Americans in no-Sunday-law California as other Sunday-law States. [62] 2. The worst influences as regards Sunday violation come from professed Christians, some of these being ministers in the Church. 3. Christians want laws to compel Sunday observance, evidently to compel these church members to live as they believe.

What a travesty is all this on the religion of Christ, when Sunday-keeping has so little support from the Scriptures, when church members set the worst example as regards its observance, then for Christians to clamor for a civil law to compel recreant brethren among others to observe it! It is a confession that it has no basis in God's word, and that they have no faith in the power of Christ to impress it upon the conscience, Sunday is a papal institution, and it takes papal means to "induce" the people, some of whom are Sunday Christians, to observe it. May it be long before California greets the Dark Ages in another Sunday law.

But our genial townsman, N. R. Johnston, member of the State Executive Committee of the California branch of the American Sabbath Association, is becoming discouraged over the prospects of a Sunday law, at least his letter of December 3, to the *Christian Statesman* so indicates. He says:—

> At my last writing I hoped to be able ere this to communicate something very encouraging as to the progress of our Sabbath cause in this State, but in common with others I have been disappointed. Even since the State convention, held while Dr. Wilbur Crafts was here, when a large Executive Committee was appointed, the interest in the cause has seemed to be growing less.

We only hope that it is true, and wish Mr. Crafts would come again and a committee twice as large be appointed. The cause, in part, of this decline our friend thinks is because of the agreement to leave out of view the divine authority and the religious feature of the reform—to work only for a "civil Sunday law, . . . to ignore the claims of the moral law of God." And Mr. Johnston concludes that '' unless there can be awakened more earnestness and a heartier cooperation on the part of church members, it will be a long time before California will have any Sabbath law or any better Sabbath observance." He "thinks it doubtful whether they will ever again have any kind of a law in favor of any kind of a Sabbath."

It is a mournful wail. If we may be allowed to suggest to these preachers, we would say, turn from man and put your trust in God. If Sunday is supported by the Bible, preach it, practice it, press it home by the aid of the Spirit of truth upon the conscience of men, and observance of the day will improve. You will not need the support of the civil arm. But if Sunday is not supported by the Bible, it is not worthy of this effort. If these ministers would only preach the gospel, what a blessing it would be. They ought to be discouraged.—*Signs of the Times, Oakland, California.*
