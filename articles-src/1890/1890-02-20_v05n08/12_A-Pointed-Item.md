# A Pointed Item.

A religious paper of Oakland, California, has the following pointed item:—

> "The field secretary of the American Sabbath Union, who has so much to say about the unfortunate and fearful condition of California with no Sunday law, says of his investigation in New York City on the first Sunday ' of the year, and since,' 'I started to write down a list of the places *open,* but found it would be much easier to make a record of the places *closed. ' *Dear Mr. Crafts, San Francisco and Oakland are not so bad as that, with no Sunday law. And if there had been such a law as you desire, how would you have escaped arrest? Under which head, 'mercy' or 'necessity,' would *your work *have come?"
