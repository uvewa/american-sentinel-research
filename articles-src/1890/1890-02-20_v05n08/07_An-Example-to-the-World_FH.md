# An Example to the World.

WITHOUT doubt the government of the United States has stood as a beacon-light to the whole world. It has done more for civil and religious liberty than any other nation. At one time it stood alone in representing the right relation of civil government and religion. This grand example has not been without fruit. Its influence has been felt throughout the world. One by one the other colonies of Great Britain have slowly followed in its wake.

The following proclamation of Queen Victoria, issued in 1858, to the natives of India, shows on the face of it the gentle influence of the United States Constitution:—

> Firmly relying ourselves on the truth of Christianity, and acknowledging with gratitude the solace of religion, we disclaim alike the right and the desire to impose our convictions on any of our subjects. We declare it to be our Royal will and pleasure that none be in any wise favored, none molested or disquieted by reason of their religious faith or observances, but that all shall alike enjoy the equal and impartial protection of the law; and we do strictly charge and enjoin all those who may be in authority under us, that they abstain from all interference with the religious belief or worship of any of our subjects, on pain of our highest displeasure.

> And it is our further will that, so far as may be, our subjects, of whatever race or creed, be freely and impartially admitted to offices in our service, the duties of which they may be qualified by their education, ability, and integrity duly to discharge.

The same desire for religious liberty is seen in the other colonies. In 1868 the union of Church and State was abolished in parts of the West Indies. In 1869 the Irish Church was disestablished. In 1870 the State Church was done away with in Jamaica and in Victoria. In 1871 civil government and religion were rent asunder in St. Kitts, Antigua, and Granada. In 1875 State aid was abolished in the Cape of Good Hope, In 1881 the same was done in Ceylon. In our own country (England) the tide towards religious equality is no less steadily setting. In 1812 the Conventicle and Five Mile Acts were repealed. In 1828 the Test and Corporation Acts likewise went. In 1855 an act for securing "Liberty of Religious Worship" was passed. In 1858 Jews were admitted into Parliament. In 1860 an act for opening of Grammar Schools for Dissenters passed. In 1867 all the Queen's subjects, without reference to their religious belief, were declared eligible for office as Lord Chancellor of Ireland. In 1870 the University Tests abolition acts passed. And at the present time strenuous efforts are being made to abolish the union of Church and State.

Yes, the influence of the Constitution still lives, and is to be seen outside of the United States. The eyes of Europe and of the world are fixed with intense interest on that country. The question to be solved is, are the people going to stay by the glorious principles set forth by the framers of the Constitution, or are they going to go back on them? Are they going to allow a few ambitious clerics to drag that country back to a mediaeval standard? God forbid! And for the cause of religious liberty may the United States Constitution forever remain as it is.

FRANK HOPE.
