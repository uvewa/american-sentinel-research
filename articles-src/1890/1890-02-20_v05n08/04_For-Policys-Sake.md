# For Policy’s Sake.

THE Freethinkers profess to be decidedly opposed to Sunday laws everywhere. Yet the *Truth Seeker* reports from “a friend” in the Washington Legislature, the following words:—

> A majority of both houses are really Freethinkers but many of them are also politicians, and would make no break that would hurt their politics; but yet I am in hopes, and encouraged to think that I can get through a Sunday law that will be quite liberal. I am convinced that the majority of the members would prefer none, but for policy’s sake, we will have to have something.

The politician takes precedence of the *free thinker* there. The Freethinkers are much like many other folk with whom they find so much fault. The *Truth Seeker *very properly remarks, that “comment on that state of things is almost superfluous.” The American Secular Union needs to hurry along with its one thousand-dollar prize manual of “the purest principles of morality.” It is much needed in the Washington Legislature right now.
