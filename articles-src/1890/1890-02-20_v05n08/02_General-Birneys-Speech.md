# General Birney’s Speech.

WE here present the speech of General A. A. Birney, of Washington City, on taking the chair to preside at the citizens’ meeting, held in that city, Tuesday evening, January 28, 1890. General Birney is a son of Hon. J. G. Birney, who ran for president on the Abolition ticket, in 1840 and 1844. He fought through the war, in which he honorably won distinction; and, as his excellent speech shows, still stands for the rights and liberties of all men under the Constitution. The General’s comments are all the more valuable as he is one of the leading lawyers of the Capital City. On taking the chair the General said:—

> I have been requested to open the meeting, by stating its object. This meeting is called by citizens who are opposed to a bill offered to the House of Representatives, on the 6th inst., by Mr. Breckinridge, entitled, “A Bill to prevent persons from being forced to labor on Sunday.” It was intended by those who called the meeting, to give a fair hearing for the friends of the bill, and, for that purpose, the invitation was extended to any one, who desired to do so, to speak in its favor.

> I believe it is customary for the chairman to announce whether he is in favor of or opposed to the position and object of the meeting. As I have not already given in my adhesion, and have not had time, since receiving notice, to prepare myself, I have written a little memorandum which I hope will be instructive and suggestive. On an analysis of this bill, I find the following to be its prominent features. It prohibits all secular work with two exceptions—“Works of necessity or mercy,” and “Any person or persons who shall conscientiously believe in and observe any other day of the week than Sunday, as a day of rest.”
> Now, a plain interpretation of this law, would render unlawful, the running of street-cars, railroad-cars and steamboats on Sunday; also the delivery of letters or telegrams on Sunday, or even driving carriages to church on Sunday. All these and similar questions, would be referred to a police judge to decide. The services of a paid janitor or salaried organist of a church, or a third party Prohibitionist meeting would need to be passed upon, as to whether secular or religious, as such meetings are frequently held, and such labor performed upon Sunday. The intervention of policemen might also be called in. In the second place, could a professional surgeon receive pay for his Sunday labor? Would a professional physician [51] and surgeon attend upon a patient with very great alacrity on Sunday, if he had no expectation of being paid for it?
Where do you draw the line between what is necessary, and what is not necessary? If I get my cook to prepare me a warm meal on Sunday, shall my cook and I be fined a hundred dollars for that?

Again, who is to decide as to whether a person’s belief is “conscientious” or not? This would be akin to the work of the Inquisition. And thus, any one would have the means of gratifying malice, private spite and personal revenge.

What is the necessity for such a law in the District of Columbia? The people of this District have their faults, but laboring on Sunday cannot be considered one of them. We have some 200 churches in this city, large, and well filled, on Sunday; and there is not a better church-going people in the United States than the people of Washington City. The sound of the trowel is not heard, and building is suspended on Sunday, and the rights of church-going people are respected here in Washington, equally with those of any city in the Union.

This sort of legislation belongs to days which are passed. In the early days of Maryland and New England, there was a good deal of it. There is now, on the statute books of this District, an old Maryland law which has never been repealed, under which, a person convicted of “blasphemy” received the mark “B” in his forehead, signifying “blasphemer” (reading statute of date, October 26, 1723). I see some here, who would stand a bad chance under that law,—for instance, my friend Dr. Shippen, pastor of the Unitarian Church. I have read this law *verbatim, *because the present bill of Mr. Breckinridge seems to have been taken from it.

Now, are we ready to go back 167 years in our legislation, to revive a law that has been rejected by the common sense of our ancestors? Such a law may be in place in countries where there is a union of Church and State, but it is out of place in this country, where no attempts upon the liberties of the citizen should be tolerated.

Now, the only principle upon which a line of this bill could be justified, would be a “sanitary” principle: that is, assuming that it is necessary for health, that a man should rest one day out of seven, assuming also that it is the duty of Congress to see that he does not labor more than the six days, and to prescribe a certain day on which he should not work. But that theory has not been sustained by the courts, besides, a great many men don’t need that restraint. They have plenty of rest, and a council of physicians would hardly say that it was necessary for them to rest on a certain day out of the seven.

But the bill is sought to be justified, by the principle that religious congregations should not be disturbed; but such congregations are already amply protected by law.

I now introduce the first speaker of the evening.
