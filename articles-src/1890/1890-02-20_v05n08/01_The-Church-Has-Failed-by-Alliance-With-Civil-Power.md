THE Merrick County (Nebraska) *Republican,* of February 7, has the following item:—

> "On Sunday evening Rev. Mitchlemore, of the Central Baptist Church, preached on the subject, 'Why prohibition does not prohibit:' As a chief reason he found that the Church had failed in its duty of reforming men by the power of Christian teaching. The Church has crippled its efficacy in moral and religious work by seeking an alliance with civil power. In other words Mr. Mitchelmore holds that the religion of Jesus Christ is the power of God unto salvation to all men, whether slaves to appetite, or money, or in whatever condition of immorality or sin. He believes the Church admits the inefficacy of Christianity when it converts itself into a political engine to accomplish the reformation of man. This view is logical and worthy of more consideration than is given it in Central City. It is certain that either Christianity has lost its saving power or many priests of God are wofully misled in their ministrations."
