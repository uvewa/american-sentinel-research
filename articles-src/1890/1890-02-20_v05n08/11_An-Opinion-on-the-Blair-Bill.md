# An Opinion on the Blair Bill.

*Truths of Nature,* a monthly journal of natural science, published in Boston, has the following concerning the Blair Sunday Bill and its supporters:—

> "He has a very powerful, but a very unchristian minority in the sponsors of his bill, seeking in this way to strengthen their waning power. The bill may be passed, for the American people are patient and long-suff ering in such cases; but there is such a thing as the 'last feather,' and when the reaction takes place in the minds of the American people the tribe of Blairs will be swept into obscurity, and the religious freedom of the people of the United States will be doubly assured. The very fact that Senator Blair, in his 'Sunday Rest bill' invokes the aid of statute law to compel the people to rest according to his programme robs the Sabbath of its holiness. . . . Each man should be allowed to spend the day according to the ' dictates of his own conscience,' so long as he does not interfere with the natural rights of others. If the churches are not filled there is something wrong in the churches. When Senator Blair's followers are prepared to discard purple and fine linen, distribute the proceeds among the poor, and then preach as did the lowly Nazarene, without price; when they are willing to follow those they desire to save, as did Jesus, they will rob their present action of its selfish aspect. The time has gone by when we could take a club and compel men to go down on their knees and pray. We can no longer put a man in the stocks for being an absentee from church on Sunday. The very power that Senator Blair seeks in his 'Sunday Rest bill, ' if granted, would defeat the object sought."
