# A Special Offer.

ANY one—either new or old subscriber—mentioning this notice, and sending us one dollar for one year’s subscription to THE AMERICAN SENTINEL within 30 days from the date of this paper, will receive by return mail, post-paid, a copy of either “Civil Government and Religion,” or “The National Sunday Law,” both of which are advertised on the preceding page.

THE Troy Annual Conference has petitioned Congress that the corps of army chaplains be enlarged. The development of a military corps of religionists, goes naturally hand in hand with legislative enactments to secure formal observance of religious doctrines.

THE *Southern Sentinel,* a Dallas, Texas, paper, that has for some months been doing good service in the promulgation of correct political doctrines in the Lone Star State, has just been enlarged. The principles of the *Southern Sentinel* are substantially the same as our own, and we rejoice in its prosperity.

THE *Inter-Ocean* says, that under the compulsory education law of Illinois, some school trustees “have assumed the right to indulge their individual prejudices against parochial schools.” Yes, such laws as that are always used that way. The proper thing to do to put a stop to it, is to blot from the statute books such laws, forever.

AUGUST 4, an election was held in Salt Lake City, in which the Liberal, or anti-Mormon ticket, was successful. Referring to this fact, the *Mail and Express *says:—

> Again the Christians have whipped their opponents. In yesterday’s election the Liberals carried the county by majorities ranging from three to five hundred, although the Mormons had placed a bogus ticket, called a “workingmen’s ticket,” in the field. The contest was bitter and exciting.

Thus, it appears that in Utah whatever is anti-Mormon is “Christian.” We have no idea, however, that the men who engaged in this “bitter and exciting” contest had any idea of doing it as Christians, but only as citizens. The use of the word “Christian” in this connection, is due to the determination of the *Mail and Express* school of politicians to so mix religious and political questions, that the people will entirely lose sight of the difference, and suffer the State to exercise authority in both spiritual and temporal affairs.

IT is stated that in a recent lecture in London, Dr. Parker said:—

> Sunday is... given up to parties at your homes, bicycling, and lawn-tennis, even among occasional church-goers, who would vote against the opening of museums on Sunday.

It should be remembered that this is in “Christian” England, where they have a national Sunday law, an established church, and about all that the National Reformers insist would make it a Christian nation. The moral is, that people cannot be made religious by law. Another thought in connection with it is, that this Sunday intolerance affects people very similarly in every part of the world; the “Christians” who want to compel others to keep Sunday when they do not keep it themselves, are not confined to England, some of them are to be found in New York, and we have even heard of them as far west as California.

THE Paterson (N. J.) *Press* has written to the authorities of one hundred-and- three of the principal cities of the United States for information as to the regulations governing the use of their public parks on Sunday. Replies were received from eighty-nine, and of these, New Orleans is the only city which makes no distinction between Sunday and other days of the week. Washington, D. C., and Richmond, Virginia, furnish no means of recreation and permit no amusements whatever in their parks on Sunday.

The comparison which the city of Washington bears in this regard to the other cities of the country, is an interesting fact to note, when it is remembered with what urgency a local Sunday law was pressed, at Washington, last winter. It is but another evidence of that which the entire country now knows, namely, that the whole effort was only an attempt to secure political capital to further the general movement for a national Sunday law.

A CORRESPONDENT of the Duluth *News, *makes the following good point:—

> Rev. W. F. Crafts, of the American Sabbath Union, after presenting his reasons for a Sunday law before an audience of workingmen, was asked if a law could not be made demanding one day of rest in seven, leaving the individual to choose his day. Mr. Crafts replied: “If you take religion out of the day, you take the rest out of it.” Now, if you cannot get rest on Sunday without religion, and a law is made compelling you to rest, what else is it but a law compelling you to be religious?

The fact is that were it not for their religious regard for Sunday, neither Mr. Crafts nor any other minister would be found pleading for a Sunday law. The history of the eight-hour movement, and other labor reforms, proves this; the ministers have, as a class, interested themselves in none of them.

PRINCE BISMARCK is credited with the following:—

> Over-education led to much dissatisfaction and disappointment in Germany, but in Russia it led to disaffection and conspiracy. There were ten times as many people educated for the higher walks as there were places to fill. Further, education was making pedantic theorists and visionaries, unfit for constitutional government. It would be madness to put such men in authority. Russians do not know yet what they want; they must therefore be ruled with a rod of iron.

Of course education unfits men to be ruled by despots. Education familiarizes men with the truth that governments derive their just powers not by inheritance, but by the consent of the governed; it is, therefore, the foe of autocrats.

ON April 9, Senator Vance introduced in the Senate, “A bill to release certain church property in the District of Columbia from taxation,” which enacts, “That all taxes and special assessments which may have been heretofore charged against any church property in the District of Columbia, but remaining unpaid, be cancelled and released: *provided,* that at the time such tax or special assessment was levied, the property in question was used exclusively for church purposes.”

Thus, unquestioned, would the United States Government recognize the demand of the Church for this *modicum* of indirect support from the State. As church property is untaxed, so all other property must submit to a heavier taxation in proportion, and therefore the taxes, which the church property would otherwise pay, are divided *pro rata* among all tax-payers, and consequently the entire taxable property is assessed with the church taxes.

By this indirection the churchman obtains from the non-churchgoer just so much towards the aggrandizement of his church, and the more worldly, wealthy, covetous and miserly the church organization is, just so much more involuntary support and aid it draws from those who are not in sympathy with its hoarding methods.
