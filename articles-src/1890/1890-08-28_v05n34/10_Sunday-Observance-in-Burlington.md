MANY of the good people of Burlington are urging on a movement, through mistaken zeal, to force the observance of Sunday as a day of rest and religious worship. Their motives, however pious, are sadly at fault—alike antagonistic to the spirit of our Constitution and the teaching of the divine Master. However right according to his conscience, it may be for the Christian to set aside the first day of the week for reflection on the goodness and mercy, and for praise and worship of the Creator, there can be nothing but harm arise from the effort to coerce others not thus inspired with the spirit of worship or veneration, or who prefer other days or methods of manifesting their religious beliefs and duties.

State enactments cannot invoke a moral force that does not exist in the masses of the people. First implant in the hearts of men a love for truth, goodness, and righteousness, and no use of policemen's clubs or courts or other punitive measures will be needed to inspire adoration of the Creator's works, or compel the keeping of his holy commands. The individual and not the State must be the one to whom teachers and pastors should appeal. "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."

Sunday, as the Christian Sabbath, is a religious institution. Its enforcement no more devolves upon the State than does that of the rite of baptism, or the Lord's Supper, or other forms, symbols or ceremonies. The object of government is civil order and welfare. Its province does not extend to spiritual affairs.— *Western Herald*,* Burlington*,* Iowa.*
