A RECENT London dispatch says:—

> The exaction of tithes for the support of the Established Church continues to excite much opposition in Wales, and at a sale under distraint in Montgomeryshire a few days ago, the chief constable was struck, and the auctioneer repeatedly kicked by a mob. The sale, however, was persisted in, and the amount distrained for recovered.

Our English cousins ought to learn that there is a better way of getting money for the support of churches than by direct tax: it is by exempting church property from taxation, and by appropriating public money for the support of denominational schools. The result is the same, and ugly scenes are avoided.
