JUST as long as Protestants insist, against all their principles of separation of Church and State, that there shall be religious exercises in the public schools, they have no argument against the Catholics. The reading of the Bible, or prayer, in the public schools is a relic of a State church, such as we used to have; and the fear of dropping it lest religion should suffer, is the survival of the cowardice which used to make the Church think it would perish if it lost the support of the State.—*Independent.*
