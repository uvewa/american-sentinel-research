A CIRCULAR letter has been issued by the Sunday Association of Illinois, to churches, trade and labor Unions and other associations, in which they ask all ecclesiastical and beneficial organizations to adopt a set of resolutions, asking Congress to pass the National Sunday-rest bill; the managers of the World's Fair to close its gates on Sunday; the pastors, church clerks, and secretaries of various ecclesiastical, ethical, or beneficial societies, to co-operate with the Sunday associations in the different States to secure Sunday legislation; and finally urging the Evangelical Alliance to give its influence especially to the furtherance of the enforcement of Sunday observance and in securing the united effort of all religious bodies to this end, with particular reference to the Sunday-rest bill and Sunday observance at the World's Fair.

Thus the work of organization for the promotion of religious legislation goes steadily on, and the plans by which it is intended to accomplish the ends expected are by no means circumscribed, but are enlarged to take advantage of the organized assistance of every society or association of men, women, or children which it is possible to enlist among the ranks of the "National Reform Soldiery," which, Miss Willard says, "goes 'marching as for war' in behalf of a national Christianity."
