# Seventy-Five Dollar Jokes.

MR. M. A. GAULT, of Blanchard, Iowa, is a district secretary, and an active worker, of the National Reform Association. We compile a few of his statements, that the reader may better appreciate what follows. Here are some of them:—

> Whether the Constitution will be set right on the question of the moral supremacy of God’s law in government, without bloody revolution, will depend entirely upon the strength and resistance of the forces of Antichrist.—*Christian Statesman*, Nov. 1886.

> Don’t think we are advocating war; but if we are not successful in the use of these other means, as it was with the anti-slavery question, after they had agitated and petitioned, and used the ballot they drew the sword; so shall we as a last resort, be compelled to use the sword and the bullet.—*Statement in a lecture at College Springs, Ia.*, Feb. 10, 1889.
> Our remedy for all these malefic influences is to have the Government simply set up the moral law, and recognize God’s authority behind it, and lay its hand on any religion that does not conform to it.— *Christian Statesman,* Jan. 13, 1887.
> We propose to incorporate in our national Constitution the moral and religious command, “In it [the Sabbath] thou shalt do no work,” except the works of necessity, and by external force of sheriffs we propose to arrest and punish all violators of this law.—*In a letter to the writer,* dated June 3, 1889.
> I see most of your literature in my travels, and I am convinced that your folks will die hard. But we are helping Brother Crafts all the time to set stakes, and get ropes ready to scoop you all in. You will kick hard, of course, but we will make sure work.—*Card to J. S. Washburn,* dated Nov. 22, 1889.
Mr. Gault, and R. C. Wylie have recently been holding local conventions at various points in Kansas, in the interests of National Reform, and especially Sabbath reform. In their convention at Garnett, Mr. McReynolds was granted twenty minutes’ time the second day of the convention, which was March 20. In introducing him, Mr. Gault stated to the convention that Mr. McReynolds’ people thought they were trying to get a law to persecute them; then turning to Mr. McReynolds, he said: “Mr. McReynolds, I would shoulder my musket and fight for you before I would see you persecuted for your faith.”

Mr. McReynolds then arose, and stated that he would first show how Mr. Gault intended to fight for us. He read the quotations from him and Mr. Graham, found in “Civil Government and Religion,” page 54; also Mr. Graham’s card to Mr. Washburn. This brought Mr. Gault to his feet. He said all the trouble was, we people did not know how to take a joke. He said he did not mean what he said, but simply wrote to Mr. Washburn in a joke. He said some of their men had said things in the past, which they do not say now; and, for his part he would withdraw all those statements he had made.

We do not wonder that some of these men feel ashamed of some of their statements when they meet them in cold printer’s ink, and that they would gladly take them back. The best they can do for them now, however, is to smooth them over, and call them “jokes,” and say they did not mean what they said. But how may we know whether they are joking, or mean what they say, or not? The surest way we have of ascertaining this, is by testing those things which they are endeavoring to secure. They are clamoring for more, and stricter, Sunday laws. How do these laws operate? Just recently (March 6) one of our brethren in Tennessee, R. M. King, has been fined seventy-five dollars for working quietly in his own field on Sunday. The judge and prosecuting attorney of the court in which he was tried, as well as his neighbors, have declared that if Mr. King and his brethren continue to labor on Sunday they must leave the country. Now, Mr. Gault may call this a joke, but we look at the matter quite differently. If he and his fellow-laborers had to pay for the come-out of their jokes, perhaps they would think differently too. Here is a man, a Seventh-day Adventist, being persecuted on account of the existence of a Sunday law. Mr. Gault has said, that before he would see our people persecuted he would shoulder his musket and fight for us. Let him take up his gun now, and go down to Tennessee. Here is an opportunity. Let him go to the court house at Troy, Obion County, and pay the seventy-five dollars and costs. Or was he also “joking” when he said to Mr. Mc Reynolds that he would fight for us? How may we know whether he meant this or not? Let him settle the bill, and then we shall have reason to believe he meant this, and was joking in his other statements; otherwise we shall probably hold to our former opinion. It was fun for the boys to stone the frogs, but it was death to the frogs. Mr. Gault and others seem to delight in making these inflammatory speeches, but seventy- five-dollar jokes are quite serious things for poor men to pay. And the worst, we fear, is not yet.—*W. A. C. in Review and Herald.*

IN proportion as the ecclesiastics became co-legislators, heresies became civil crimes, and liable to civil punishments.—*Dean*, *Milman*. [254]
