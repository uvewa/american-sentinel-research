THE St. Paul *Dispatch* notes the fact that a new Russian war vessel is called *The Twelve Apostles,* and says: "Its presumable mission is to go abroad into all the world and preach the gospel of—fiendish despotism." And that is about as near as any civil government can come to preaching the gospel. Civil government always smuts religion when it touches it.
