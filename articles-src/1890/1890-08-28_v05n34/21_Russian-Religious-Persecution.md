COMMENTING upon an imperial ukase recently issued, forbidding further action by Protestant missionaries, especially in western Russia, under the penalty of expulsion from the empire, the *Mail and Express* says:—

> This is in perfect keeping with the treatment which the Hebrews are now receiving in the same country; and it is in harmony with the policy which is crushing out Lutheranism and German speech in the Baltic provinces. The Russian Government seems resolved to make an end of all race, religious, and lingual differences within the limits of the empire. It is a policy which has its merits; but it is very cruel. It can be carried out only in Russia.

The *Mail and Express* is about the last paper that ought to find any fault with the Czar for any efforts which he may make to put an end to race, religious, and lingual differences in his empire, for that is practically what it advocates doing in this country. Such a policy is, however, neither more meritorious nor less cruel in America, than in Russia.
