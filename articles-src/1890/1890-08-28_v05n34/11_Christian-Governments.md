THE *Christian Index and Southern Baptist* says:—

The only governments in the world which are Christian, according to the *Catholic Review,* are those of Spain, Austria, and Ecuador. If this is true, then it is also true that a Christian government is no great gain to a people—a conclusion which refutes the assumption which it follows. The fact is that, in the sense of the New Testament no government is Christian, and least of all among civilized nations the governments that are Romanist. [270]
