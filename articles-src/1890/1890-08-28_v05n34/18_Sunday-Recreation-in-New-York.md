THE *World* asks: "How long will the anachronism and injustice continue which compel New Yorkers to violate some statute in order to get needed and innocent recreation on Sunday?" It will continue as long as the State attempts to compel people who have not a religious regard for Sunday to act as though they had. As it stands, the law is utterly useless; and serves only to breed contempt for all law.
