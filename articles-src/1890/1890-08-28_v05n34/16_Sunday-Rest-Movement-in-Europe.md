THE movement for the promotion and enforcement of the observance of Sunday as a day of rest, is making rapid strides in Europe, as is shown by the following Paris dispatch to the London *Daily News:—*

A short time ago MM. Jules Simon, Leon Say, and Cheysson, in the name of the League for the Promotion of Sunday Rest for Working People, wrote to the Minister of Public Works, to assist them in an appeal to the railway companies. They did not ask him to use any compulsion, but simply to show himself favorable to the objects of the League, in asking the companies how they might possibly meet them, and whether it would not be possible to suspend, wholly or partially, goods traffic on Sunday. M. Yvest Guyot, in answer states that he has submitted the application of the League to the railway companies, in the hope that they would so arrange the regulations for goods traffic as to be able to grant one day in seven, or at least a part of one to those employed.
