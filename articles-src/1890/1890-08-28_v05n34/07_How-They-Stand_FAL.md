THE meeting of the National Educational Association, convened at St. Paul, Minn., July 8.

After the addresses of welcome, a number of responses were made. The following extracts from the sayings of prominent men of the country show the attitude they sustain toward the subject of religious liberty.

President J. W. Strong, of Carleton College, addressed the assemblage eloquently on behalf of those institutions of the State which are not under State control, and for the educational interests of Minnesota. He said: "But there are in Minnesota other educational interests not under its direct control. Our private schools and our seminaries of learning are not technical parts of our system, but they play a great and important part in our work of education. These parts are in nowise antagonistic to each other, but aim at what the State can never give, a *moral and religious training and symmetrical development*, which in ordinary schools is not to be had.... We do not ask the State to teach religion, but we hold that for her own sake she must guard well religious liberty."

Dr. W. T. Harris, of Washington, D. C., said: "In your proffers of free education, we recognize a devoted interest in the fundamental principles of good government, and while your schools are conducted on this broad basis of virtue and intelligence, let us urge that to enhance their good work there must never be a substitution of school work for that of the Church; nor can it be done with safety." F. A. LASHIER.
