THE *Christian Advocate*, of this city, has the following:—

> By whom are the saloons supported? Not by the women; not by the ministers and teachers; not by the substantial business men and thriving manufacturers. The Rev. H. W. Bennett, of Columbus, Ohio, says that on Saturday evening careful watch was kept for one hour over five saloons in that city, during which time 640 persons entered, 554 of whom were young men. That hour and that night may be a fair sample, and that city quite like other cities. The young men who work in the mills and shops, and the young men who do not work, support the saloons.

The question which this suggests to our minds, is, Would a Sunday-closing law prevent this? The answer must clearly be in the negative. And yet we are gravely told that more liquor is sold on Sunday than upon any other day. If the demand for Sunday-closing was made broad enough to cover all the time from Saturday noon till Monday morning, there would be a little more consistency in parading it as a temperance measure. As it is, the most that can be said for it is that it is probably of about as much value, from a prohibition standpoint, as high license, unless, as is the case in this city, corrupt police captains make it a source of revenue by permitting, for a money consideration, a side-door business on Sunday.
