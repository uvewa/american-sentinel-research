THE papers of Finland have received notice from the Russian authorities that advocating the people's rights, even in the most sober manner, must stop. The Czar is determined to be a "father" to his people, even if he has to banish half of them to compel the other half to adopt the "true religion" and correct political views. The Government of Russia is thoroughly paternal.
