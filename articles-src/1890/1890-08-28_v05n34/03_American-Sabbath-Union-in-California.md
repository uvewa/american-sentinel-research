A CALIFORNIA paper has the following note:—

The Executive Committee of the American Sabbath Union has appointed the Rev. Edward Thomson, D. D., LL.D., the State secretary of the association for California, and district secretary for the Pacific Coast. He has appointed a district convention in San Francisco, for August 1G, 17, 18. Bishop Fowler is expected to preside, and Bishop John P. Newman will assist. The *California Christian Advocate* says: "This will be the opening of what we trust may prove a successful campaign in the interests of Sunday reform. The American Sabbath Union has accomplished great things in other States, and we doubt not if the Christian people of every denomination will give Dr. Thomson and his coworkers a hearty welcome, that much may be done here." We presume that this means the beginning of active work with reference to the coming State election.
