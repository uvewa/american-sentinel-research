# Very Apparent.

WORKING people in France are now entitled to rest one day in seven. But inasmuch as the Legislature declined to designate *Sunday* as the legally appointed rest-day, the law is not satisfactory to ultra Sunday-law advocates. It is indeed probable that the result of the law will be less Sunday labor, and that that will be the day generally selected by employes, but that which is really desired by the Sunday people is not only Sunday rest from labor, but governmental recognition of Sunday sacredness. Commenting upon the French law, the *Christian Advocate,* of this city, says:—

> Some of the nations of Europe have long tried the experiment of ignoring the divinely established law of a seventh-day’s rest, and have found the results unsatisfactory. Gradually but surely steps are being taken toward restoring the Sabbath to its place among the national institutions of government on the Continent. What folly it would be for us to rush into the same error which is now being abandoned by other countries after sufficient trial. Yet this is the tendency in America. No nation can defy or ignore the law of God and escape disastrous results. “God is not mocked.”

The inconsistency in this is apparent when we come to consider that if the divine law means simply “a seventh-day’s rest,” the French law meets it fully; and if it means a definite seventh day, as the Jews, and not a few Christians hold, it does not help the matter in the least, for *Sunday is not the seventh day, but the first.* As before remarked, they want laws which will recognize *Sunday* as the Sabbath, and they will be satisfied with nothing less.
