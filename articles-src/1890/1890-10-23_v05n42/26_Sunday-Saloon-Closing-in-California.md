A REPORT of a committee at a recent Sunday-law meeting in California, contains this statement: "The public ought to be thoroughly informed of the reasons for the Sunday closing of saloons." Well the reason is not far to seek, nor hard to state; it is simply a desire on the part of one part of the community to honor the first day of the week because they regard it as the Sabbath by divine appointment. If the motive were purely or even primarily a temperance one they would demand the closing of saloons on all days.
