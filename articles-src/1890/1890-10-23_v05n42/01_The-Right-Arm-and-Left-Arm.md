"THE right arm of the American Sabbath Union," says Mr. Crafts, "is the promotion of the religious Sabbath; its left arm the preservation of the civil Sabbath. These two things—the Christian Sabbath on the one hand, and the American Sabbath on the other hand—are as distinct as my two arms, that resemble and co-operate, and yet are by no means the same." And as it is usually the office of the left arm to assist the right, so the office of the "civil Sabbath" is to assist in forcing the observance of a religious institution upon the American people.
