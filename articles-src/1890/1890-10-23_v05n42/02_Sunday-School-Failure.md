A CHURCH paper says: "There are ten million pupils in the Sunday-schools of the country. A better showing ought to be made in morals, but the fact is, thousands leave the Sunday-school for the saloon, and the downward path in other directions. There is certainly a failure somewhere." Yes, there is a failure; and the reason is found in the fact that too many depend far too much upon the Sunday-school to give their children religious instruction. No school instruction can possibly take the place of the religious instruction that should be given in the home.
