TROUBLE over the reading of the Bible in the public schools is reported from the Western Reserve, in Ohio. A parent complains that the teacher to whom his children are sent, persists in devoting a portion of each day to scriptural reading, and as his children are compelled to be present, according to the school-room rule, he demands to know whether he cannot legally withdraw his children during that hour.
