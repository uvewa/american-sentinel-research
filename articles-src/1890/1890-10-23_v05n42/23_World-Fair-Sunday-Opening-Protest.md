IT is stated that Secretary Dickinson of the World's Fair Commission, is deluged with letters and protests against Sunday opening. So numerous are they that he has been compelled to have circulars printed acknowledging their receipt. In the number of petitions the Christian Endeavor Society heads the list, half the petitions and remonstrances coming from branches of that organization; then comes individual churches, then the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. "Already," says the *Mail and Express*, "it is evident that the opposition to Sunday opening will be the most formidable demonstration of its kind ever made in the country." We wonder if in this, as in the matter of a national Sunday law, the petitioners are to be counted several times.
