COMMENTING upon the Tennessee Sunday-law cases, a London, England, paper says:—

> "All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets." Matt. 7:12. If this rule of conduct were followed, we should have no occasion to report such cases as these prosecutions in Tennessee under the Sunday law. This State has had a bad record for a few years past, in this respect.

This is true, but the Golden Rule has no place in the code of those who make and enforce Sunday laws.
