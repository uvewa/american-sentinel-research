## An Interesting Case.

A NOVEL and very interesting case is to be tried at the present term of the Illinois Supreme Court, which involves the question of compelling students in institutions of learning supported by the State, to attend the devotional exercises which precede the regular work of the day.

A student of the University of Illinois, —established under the laws of Congress and the State of Illinois, in the years 1866 and 1867, "to teach in the most thorough manner such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts, including military tactics, and not excluding other scientific or literary studies,"—absented himself from the morning devotional exercises, for which absence he was expelled.

He has brought action against the trustees of the University, and will rest his case on Sec. 3, Art. 2 of the Constitution of the State, which says: "No person shall be required to attend or support any ministry or place of worship against his consent, nor shall any preference be given by law to any religious denomination or mode of worship."

## Non-Partisan Temperance Work.

Mrs. J. Ellen Foster, President of the Non-Partisan Woman's Christian Temperance Union, of Iowa, spoke in Central Music Hall, Sunday, October 5, on the history of the temperance movement in this country, the principles on which it is now based, and the relation of the organization which she represents to that reform. She gave this, among other reasons, why the Woman's Christian Temperance Union could not be partisan, that the organization was born of the Church, nourished by the Church, and could not consistently unite, as a body, with any political party any more than could the Church. [331]

In the course of her address, she had occasion to refer to majorities, in the following words, which show that she does not accept the prevalent idea of the infallibility of majorities: "Majorities when right are magnificent, but when wrong are dreadful."

Her address was characterized by a spirit of Christian fairness and honest conviction born of truth.

## The Bible In The Public Schools.

The following petition is now being circulated in the city, by the Woman's Moral and Educational Union, and thousands of signatures are being secured:—

> *To the Honorable Board of Education of the City of Chicago.*

> *Petition for the Reading of the Bible in the Public Schools.*
> WHEREAS, the Bible is the great fountain of public and private morals, and contains the most exalted literature ever produced;—and.
> WHEREAS, the effect of reading appropriate extracts therefrom, to and by the pupils in the public schools would be to elevate their minds, and strengthen their moral character.
> *Therefore,* The undersigned citizens of Chicago respectfully pray that the proper order may be made to require the reading of such extracts in the opening exercises each day, of all departments of the public schools in Chicago.
> The undersigned regard the claim that such reading would be an infringement of just personal or religious liberty, as wholly destitute of merit, and insist that such reading would still leave the mind and conscience of every pupil entirely free from any improper bias.
At a meeting of the Methodist ministers of the city, held October 6, the movement was indorsed. Several prominent clergymen of the city are opposed to the movement, among them Rev. H. J. Jackson, of the Mansfield Avenue Methodist Church; Rev. William Lawrence, of the Independent Baptist Church; and Rev. John L. Withrow, of the Third Presbyterian Church.

A committee waited on Archbishop Freehan to secure his indorsement of the movement. They took with them a copy of a book of Scriptural extracts, which read alike in both the King James and the Douay versions, used in the schools of Toronto, Canada, and asked the Archbishop if he would agree to such a compromise in Chicago schools. He replied that the conditions here were different and that he could not indorse the proposition. They called also on Rabbi Hersch, who refused to sign the petition and promised to give his reasons in writing.

Some of the agitators are willing to select their quotations from the Old Testament only, in deference to the Jews. They go even further, and state that they are willing to confine the selections read, to the Proverbs, that both the Catholics and the Jews may be satisfied. No attention is paid to the views of infidels.

Without doubt the majority of those who are agitating this question are actuated by the purest of motives. They see the moral degeneracy of the rising generation, and in casting about for a remedy they decide that the Bible read in the public schools is one, and not following the logic of the movement to its legitimate conclusion, they, with more heart than wisdom, enthusiastically set out to accomplish their object. That they are wofully in error concerning the province of civil government, is shown from the position taken by the president of the Union, in conversation with your correspondent. "I am opposed," said she, "to teaching sectarianism in our public schools, but there is a national Christianity upon which all can agree. The Government establishes a standard of weights and measures, and for the same reason should establish a standard of religion."

Your correspondent is more than ever convinced that THE AMERICAN SENTINEL has entered upon its mission none too soon. These movements are but the vanguard of a large and rapidly organizing army, or as one of the editors of the Chicago *Evening Journal* stated it, "They are the ripples on the surface of a great sea."

We will speak of the agitation to close the World's Fair on Sunday, in our next.

A. F. BALLENGER.
