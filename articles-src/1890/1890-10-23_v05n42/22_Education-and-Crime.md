ONE of our exchanges, the *Loyal American*, notes the fact that "the prisoners in the Stillwater prison, Minn., publish a weekly paper, the *Prison Mirror*, at one dollar per annum. It is edited and printed by the convicts." And yet like a great many other people, the editor of the *American* insists that the State should educate its citizens *to prevent crime!* Education is a good thing, a very good thing, but as a preventive of crime it is not much of a success. Thousands of men in the penitentiaries of the various States, and thousands more who ought to be "doing time," are educated men. If only the illiterate were dishonest and vicious, the amount of business transacted by our criminal courts would be very much less than it is.
