THE *Sabbath Harbinger* is the name of a new 24-column monthly, "religious family paper, devoted to missionary work and Sabbath reform in the South." It is published by the Southern Sabbath Publishing Association, Beauregard, Miss. "It will be," says the publishers, "uncompromisingly opposed to anything tending toward the encroachments, usurpations, and assumed authority of a hierarchy, either in name or in fact, let it come from whatever source it may." If this promise is redeemed, the *Harbinger* will oppose the work of the American Sabbath Union, and the schemes of the National Reform Association.
