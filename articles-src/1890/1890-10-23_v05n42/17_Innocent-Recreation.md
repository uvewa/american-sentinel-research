"IT is this 'innocent recreation, '" says the New York *Observer,* "advocated by Cardinal Gibbons and Liberal Protestants, that destroys the idea of Sunday being a holy day." The inference is that the State should forbid innocent recreation. It is this thought that inspires the demand for Sunday laws on the part of churches and church papers. [335-336]
