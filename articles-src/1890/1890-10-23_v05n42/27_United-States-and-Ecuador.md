ARE there many people in this country who would be pleased to see the United States governed as Ecuador is? Perhaps not, but there are many thousands of people among us who are striving to bring about a union of Church and State, and if they are successful it will only be a question of time—a comparatively short time—when the only difference between the United States and Ecuador, will be in the number of population and the area of territory.—*American Standard. *[337]
