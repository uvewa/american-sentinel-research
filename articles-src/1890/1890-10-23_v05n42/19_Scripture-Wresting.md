IN an article in the *Evangel of Rest,* Rev. J. M. Hamilton quotes Lev. 19:30: "Ye shall keep my Sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary," and applies it to Sunday-keeping and attendance upon church services! Ps. 87:2, and 132:14, are wrested in like manner; while Isa. 66:23, is tortured into a command for everybody to go to meeting upon the first day of the week! And that he calls teaching divine truth!
