> What constitutes a State?

> *Not* high-raised battlement and labored mound, . Thick wall and moated gate;
> *Not* cities proud with spires and turrets crowned.
> *Not* broad-armed bays and ports.
> Where laughing at the storm, rich navies ride:
> *Not* starred and spangled courts.
> Where low-bred baseness casts perfume to pride;
> No, men, high-minded men—
Men who their *duties* know.

But know their *rights,* and knowing dare maintain.

These constitute a State.—*Sir William Jones.*
