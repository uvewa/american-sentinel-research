THE American Sabbath Union, of the United States, has its peer in the "Lord's Day Alliance," of Canada, in which most of the Protestant denominations of the Dominion are said to be represented The Presbyterian Church seems, there, to take the initiative, as it does here. At a late meeting of the Presbyterian General Assembly the Committee of Sabbath observance presented a set of resolutions which were adopted. The following are the fourth and fifth resolutions in the series:—

> 4. That the Assembly records its approval of the effort now being made to obtain from Parliament a Sabbath law for the whole Dominion, recommends presbyteries and kirk sessions to take action in support of it by petition or any other way that may be deemed efficient, and that the Assembly again forward to Parliament a petition in favor of such legislation.

> 5. That the Assembly expresses its gratification at the cordial co-operation of all the Protestant denominations, as manifested in the Lord's Day Alliance of Canada, and appoints as its representatives in the Alliance the members of the Sabbath Observance Committee.
