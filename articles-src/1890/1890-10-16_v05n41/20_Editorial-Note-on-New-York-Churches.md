THE "Metropolitan Church and Choir Directory," for 1890, gives the number of churches in New York and Brooklyn as 750. This is an item of importance, as well as interest, when it is considered that effort is now being made to show the strength of the churches as a factor in local politics in the city of New York. How long is it possible for the Church to exert itself in politics in New York City, without becoming a full-rigged political machine? Have the political bosses in the past shown themselves too highminded to steal the livery of the Church to serve their master the devil, and Mammon, in? Certainly this is what they will do the very hour these noble-purposed, but mistaken gentlemen succeed in making the Church a political power.
