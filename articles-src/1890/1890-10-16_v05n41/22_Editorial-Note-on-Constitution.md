WE find the following in an exchange, credited "*Voice;"* we doubt if it is from the paper of that name published in this city, but it may be:—

> For our part we want to see less useless and hopeless tinkering with the Federal Constitution, and more of an effort to secure a government in conformity with the spirit of that still grand document. The changes the people of America most need are not changes in the Constitution. That is about the only thing left in our Government to be proud of.

We, too, believe that our Constitution is as nearly perfect as it can be made, certainly much more nearly so than it would be if amended according to the programme of the various and numerous Constitution tinkers. Let it remain as it is; and obey it as it is.
