SAYS the *Christian Statesman:—*

> The platform of the Prohibition party, in Pennsylvania, retains the familiar pregnant acknowledgment of Almighty God as the source of all power and authority in civil government.

It follows that should that party come into power it would attempt to define and to enforce the will of God, and herein lies the evil of such acknowledgment by parties and by governments.

Every individual should not only acknowledge, but should yield allegiance to God for himself, and should do all that he can, by persuasion, to induce others to do the same, but political parties should do nothing of the kind for they are organized for the express purpose of administering the government, and as government is force, for a political party to make such an acknowledgment as that quoted above, is simply to avow the purpose to force upon all the people their interpretation of the will of God. God has not committed such power to men.
