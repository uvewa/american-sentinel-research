REFERRING to the Lutheran declaration that the "underlying principle of the Bennett law is needless interference with parental rights and liberty of conscience," *America* says:—

> The best refutation of this false charge is to be found in the fact that, although the law has been in force nearly two years, there has not been a single prosecution under its provisions.

Indeed, simply because a law is not enforced it is a just and humane law! It must be then that the Tennessee Sunday law was a perfectly righteous statute, till R. M. King was arrested and fined under it, simply to gratify the intolerance of his bigoted neighbors. Strange logic, that!
