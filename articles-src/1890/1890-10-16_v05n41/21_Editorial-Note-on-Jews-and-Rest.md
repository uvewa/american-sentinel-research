THE *Christian Statesman,* of August 7, has the following, which is interesting, especially in view of some of the so-called arguments in favor of compulsory Sabbath keeping:—

> A well informed authority says that Columbia College, New York, is largely carried on for the benefit of the Jews. They take five times as many prizes, in proportion to their numbers, as other classes; and in the annex to Columbia College, seventy per cent of the pupils are Jewesses. The Jews control journalism in Germany, and are very largely influential in journalism all over the world.

This ought, certainly, to disprove the claim so confidently made in justification of Sunday laws, namely, that a regular day of rest is a physical necessity, and that in order for a portion of the community to take the necessary rest all must rest. The Jews do not rest habitually on Sunday, and it must be confessed that but few of them observe with any degree of strictness any other day; yet it is a fact that in point of both mental and physical vigor they excel. This fact, coupled with like facts concerning the Japanese, a people who keep no rest day, ought to effectually dispose of the fiction that a regular weekly rest is a *physical* necessity.
