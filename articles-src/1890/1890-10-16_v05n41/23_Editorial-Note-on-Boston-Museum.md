IT has been proved by actual demonstration in Boston, that Sunday opening of their Museum of Fine Arts is appreciated by the general public. A writer in the *Independent,* of this city, says:—

> The Boston Museum gives free admission to visitors two days in the week, Saturdays and Sundays. On Saturdays the average number of visitors last year was 776. The Museum is open on Sunday afternoons from one till five, at hours not conflicting with church services. The average number of Sunday admissions last year was 1,317.

The admissions for four hours Sunday afternoons, were almost double that of the ten hours of Saturdays,—though both are free days.

If the museums are designed to be instructors of the people, why not give laboring men and women the benefit of them without at the same time requiring them to make a financial sacrifice, which they must do if they go upon working days?
