# The Massing of the Forces.

IN an address delivered at the Lakeside Assembly, in August, Miss Frances E. Willard thanked God for the marshalling of the National Reform soldiery “marching as for war.”

At such a time, when reinforcements are so rapidly joining themselves to the ranks of the party which assumes to be the army of moral reform, it does not come amiss to enumerate the detachments of which this marching host is composed.

Dr. McAllister says of these gathering forces, in the preface to his “Manual of Christian Civil Government: ”—

> These days of peace do not call patriots to the battle-field. The God of nations is blessing us with rest from war. But the Christian patriot’s ear catches stirring calls to more strenuous and momentous conflicts than any “battle of the warriors” with its “confused noise, and garments rolled in blood.” The enemies of our national Christianity are both powerful and active. They have begun their attack. Our Christian institutions of Government are at stake. And the same love of country that would summon the patriot to the field of battle, summons him now to the field of moral conflict, where the friends and foes of our American national Christianity are deploying and skirmishing, and must soon come to the decisive engagement.

The issue is stated here. Although by implication, still it is direct implication. What is it? It is between “American national Christianity” and the Christianity of the Bible,—God’s religion pure and undefiled, which savoreth not of the things which be of this world.

In whatever country it has been established, and by whatever name it has been called, whether it has been the Church of Rome, the Greek Church, the Church of England, or the American national Christianity, the intent and effect of the organization of a “national Christianity” has invariably been to uphold the “traditions of men,” and maintain them in the face of the divinely spoken truth of the word of God. This is the case now. Can the result be expected to differ from past similar conflicts? It cannot, except in degree. And this is the only way in which it will differ. Prophecy shows it surely, clearly, definitely. But then the end comes. Here is the final deliverance, and the right does triumph eternally. Sin and wrong die with the wicked and the unjust, and exist no longer. The joy of eternal bliss and the grandeur of heavenly perfection are then attained. But these hosts, who call to one another with such sounding of the trumpet, and gather with such worldly pomp and pageantry, truly and literally an “army with banners,” should stop and ask themselves who is it that will be called “great in the kingdom of heaven?” and who is it that “in no case shall enter” therein?

Did not He in whose name they profess to assemble, accept the crown of thorns as a lowly symbol of his ministering service to mortality? and did He not most sternly reprove his disciples when they spoke the things which savored of this world? And who did He say should be with him in his kingdom? Was it not the persecuted, the peacemakers, the pure in heart, the merciful, the meek, the mourners, the poor in spirit, and those that hunger and thirst after righteousness? Are those terse sentences, in which Christ named the host of the blessed, descriptive of the serried ranks that march as for war in behalf of a “national Christianity?”

Let them who would choose between the mortal error into which the Jews fell at the first coming of Christ, (when they in their vainglory of race, and pride of the world looked for him to assume an earthly scepter, and his true kingdom which is not of time and death), take thought not to fall into such an error at his second coming. At that time the Jews stood for a distinctively national Christianity, with the Messiah as their earthly king. Who is it that stands similarly, for a distinctively “American national Christianity”? It is the National Reform party, that for twenty-seven years has been a growing power in this country.

Who is it with clear-voiced utterance, “local, State, national, and world-wide” in the scope of its influence, says that Christ shall be king of this transitory, sin-defiled world,—King of its despotic and corrupt courts—of its camps of license and violence—of its commercial robbery and injustice,—King of its tyrannical and extortionate customs, and of its imperfect Constitutions,—and that through the gateway of political corruption Christ shall enter the realm of law—human law? It is the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, in unison with the National Reform party.

Next to this detachment from the motherhood of the State, comes a maidenly contingent of human loveliness, fit only for a war of roses indeed, which steps in delicately, stately trippings to the martial music of National Reform.

With the sweetest and loveliest and last [311] of fashions, graceful concessions to a silken Christianity, they say, with haughty humility which fits so well their perfect manner and easy courtliness of bearing, “We are the ‘King’s Daughters, ’ we command you ‘In His Name.’”

But who are these who pass as a brook of rippling youthful laughter fit to flow through the golden streets? It is the Young People’s Society of Christian Endeavor, the children’s crusade of the nineteenth century, marching to as pitiful an end, and for as futile a purpose, as were the Crusaders when led by fanatic zeal to the conquest of the holy sepulchre.

As a rear-guard to this marvellous religious army of the world, marches a vast body of churchmen at arms, whose very presence is a benediction, and whose benign graciousness assures to the motley host protection and safety for time and eternity,—the Evangelical and Ministerial Alliance.

As outposts, and flying patrol along the whole line, the Law and Order Leagues are stationed.

This is “the National Reform soldiery ‘marching as for war.’”

Does this display of worldly influence and human force tally well with that meek and saintly patience which the Bible says must characterize those who become subjects of our Lord and of his Christ in his eternal kingdom?W. H. M.

IT is remarkable that in this country of boasted religious liberty, Christians use the civil courts to persecute other Christians who insist upon obeying the Bible by working six days in the week and resting on the seventh.*—Denison *(*Texas*)* Gazetteer*. [312]

THE Mayor of Altoona, Pennsylvania, has caused the cigar stores and ice-cream saloons in that city to be closed on Sunday, and expects to keep them closed. Persons who wish ice cream for Sunday, will have to eat it the day before.

ON the 23d ult., the World’s Fair Commission referred to a committee, a resolution offered by Commissioner Rush Strong, of Tennessee, declaring that, “as a Sabbathkeeping nation, and being desirous of following in the channel of all great American Expositions, the Commission is opposed to opening, or keeping open, the Exposition on Sunday.”

This is supposed to mean that definite action on the question will not be taken for two years, or just before the opening of the Fair.

THE *Truth Seeker* thinks that clergymen should not be disfranchised as they are under the new *regime* in Brazil. It says:—

> It is not right, though it may be expedient considering the character of the clergy and their proneness to maneuver for the aggrandizement of the Church. Ministers should be treated the same as other men. . . . Give them freedom and suffrage, treat them as though they were not dependents, and they will come out all right in time.

Government should be purely secular, and should give itself not the least concern about the religion or religious calling of its subjects.

REV. JAMES MCCOSH, D. D., LL. D., ex-President of Princeton College, in discussing the question of the revision of the Confession of Faith,” says:—

> There are some ministers and elders who have been speaking very unadvisedly as to revision, and leaving the impression that they are ready to abandon some of the essential truths of religion on which the hopes of Christians depend. They are persons who have not been trained in the severer truths of the Word (we are to “behold both the goodness and severity of God”). A few of them have come from other denominations, where they were not taught the sovereignty of God. The greater number have received their higher training in Germany under professors elected, not by the Church but by the State; in other words, by politicians, and have no fixed faith in the inspiration of Scripture.

This is not a very good testimonial to the benefits of State religion, nor to State teaching of religion; but it is fully justified by the facts. Germany has long been noted for its infidelity; and, as Dr. McCosh intimates, it is unquestionably due to the fact that its ministers of religion are for the most part trained in colleges supported by the State, and presided over by men selected, not because of their piety, but through political favoritism. A similar state of affairs would produce like results in this country.

FELIX R. BRUNOT, President of the National Reform Association, has issued a call for a conference on “the Christian principles of civil government,” “to be held in Nashville, Tennessee, on, or about, the 15th of February next.” The conference should also consider the Christian principles of the Golden Rule. A conscientious study of that matchless Rule, in Nashville, might lead to a repeal of the wicked and oppressive Sunday law which now disgraces the State of Tennessee.

SOME time ago the whole plea for the closing of the proposed World’s Fair was made on the ground of morals; now the spectacle is presented of ministers and churches uniting as one man to secure Sunday closing in order that the employes may rest! It seems just a little strange, however, that the religious element of this country is never concerned about the welfare of the workingman except in the matter of Sunday observance. Can it be that Sunday rest is the only thing to be desired by the toiling masses

AT a meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Reform Association, held in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, September 5, this, among other recommendations, was adopted:—

> That we resume the circulation of petitions to Congress for the Christian amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and that a hearing be secured, if possible, on this subject before the Judiciary Committees of the Senate and House.

The Secretary was also instructed to prepare, and forward to both houses of Congress, a memorial praying for a constitutional amendment forbidding sectarian instruction in the public schools, but providing that it shall not be so construed as to exclude the use of the Bible in such schools.

THE *Christian Statesman* has an editorial note, which says:—

> We have never seen the Hebrew theocracy fully and correctly discussed. Foolish and incorrect ideas on the subject pervade our literature, and are heard continually on the platform, and even in the pulpit.

This is quite an acknowledgment. We have long known that National Reform literature was pervaded by foolish and incorrect ideas of a theocracy, but we had scarcely looked for such a frank acknowledgment of this fact from the *Christian Statesman.* What is said of the platform and pulpit is no doubt equally true; we are well aware that National Reform speakers are very prone to “foolish and incorrect ideas,” and not only so, but they have a fondness for parading them before the public.

THAT the present demand for Sunday laws is largely to supply a lack on the part of those who profess to revere that day, is shown by the following editorial note in the New York *Observer:—*

> For all this breaking down of Sabbath sentiment the religious people of this country are to blame. It is not the reaction from Puritanism. It is the selfindulgence of nominal Christians that makes them powerless to support by their words and actions the national Sunday.

Just so; “nominal Christians” are so given to self-indulgence that they set a bad example; therefore an appeal is made to civil law to bolster up a tottering morality which, at best, is only skin deep.

DR. JOHN HALL, writing from England, to the New York *Mail and Express*, devotes considerable space in his letter to the consideration of the agitation of the question of the relations of Church and State, now going on in the Old World, Dr. Hall says:—

> To an extraordinary degree the questions of the relations of the Church and State are now occupying the European mind. Not in Great Britain only, but in Germany and other sections in which intellectual activity is found, there is, on many grounds, deep dissent from the view of Milton that the Church of Christ is not strong enough to stand unless buttressed by temporal power and civil resources. In some cases the stir is on the ground of taxation without benefit; in some it is on the ground of taxation without representation; in some it is based on direct dislike to the cause of religion, and in some it is unhappily the outcome of religious discussion. “The Welsh Nonconformist ministers are becoming political preachers,” say the clergy who are for establishment. “Well” they reply, “the bishops and rectors have always been political nominees; they have no right to criticise us.”

Dr. Hall continues for a third of a column to describe the agitation and recrimination upon Church and State questions now going on in England. At the present rate of increase in the general attention paid to this subject, how long will it be before the relations of religion and government will be the all-absorbing political issue of the world?
