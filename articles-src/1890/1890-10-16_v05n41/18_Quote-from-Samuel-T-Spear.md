THE State is not an exhorter, or a pursuader, or a debating club, but a positive law power for secular purposes; and hence, when it attempts to administer religion, it must of necessity give to it the law force, deciding what religion is true, and by what method it shall be promoted. There is no escape from this result, if we admit the principle from which it springs. *—Samuel T. Spear, D. D. *[327-328]
