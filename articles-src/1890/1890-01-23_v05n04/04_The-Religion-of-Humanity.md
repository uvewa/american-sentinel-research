# The Religion of Humanity.

THE New York *Press,* of the 29th ult., has an editorial notice of the late Conference on moral education in the public schools, from which we quote as follows:—

> There is rather more of a theological tone than is desirable about the discussion that has been conducted by some very good Christian ministers this week, about moral education in the public schools. There is the same old tendency to identify religion with theology, and to assume apparently that if common ground can be found on which Protestants and Catholics can stand, the humanitarian end of the Unitarian Church, the Hebrews and Ethical Culturists and Agnostics will accept the teachings of theology in the public schools, on the general theory that “this is a Christian Nation.”...

> Now this Nation, or any other nation, can be Christian in its religion without being Christian in its theology. The word “religion” has the same root “*lig,*” as the word “obligation.” It signifies something binding, and that something is a sense of duty. All learned students of the science of morals admire the Christian system of morality. It is imbedded in our national Constitution itself. The recognition of the rights of another to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, the Anglo-Saxon doctrine of fair play, is an application of the Golden Rule enunciated by Jesus of Nazareth....
> Those who worship Jesus of Nazareth as God incarnate ought to be the readiest of all, in view of these his plain teachings, to come together with Hebrews and Liberals and Agnostics on a humanitarian application of his moral teachings to the purposes of public instruction. The rights of the minority, who, while accepting his supremacy as the world’s greatest teacher of morals, are not agreed as to his theological status, require that theology should be kept out of the question. We can no more have a State theology than we can have a State Church. The “religion of humanity” is unsatisfactory as a theology, but that and nothing more is all the religion that the public schools have any business to teach. The point where humanitarian religion stops and theology begins is just the right place for the public schools to draw the line.
It seems to us that the writer of the foregoing attempts to make a distinction where there is no real difference. It is true that religion and theology are not synonymous, yet there is not, we apprehend, that distinction which some imagine that there is. *“Religion,”* says Webster, “as distinguished from *theology,* is subjective, designating the feelings and acts of men which relate to God; while theology is objective, and denotes those ideas of God which man entertains respecting the God whom he worships.” That is, theology is the theory, while religion is theory reduced to practice.

“The word ‘religion’ has,” says the *Press,* “the same root as the word ‘obligation.’ It signifies something binding, and that something is a sense of duty.” Very good; but according to Webster’s statement of the difference between *religion* and *theology* this root means more than a sense of duty in the abstract; it means a sense of duty toward God. *“Re” *means “back again, or anew,” and *“lig” *means, as the *Press* says, obligation, or something binding; it follows that the Christian religion means binding again to the Christian’s God. The sense of duty is religion; but before there can be that sense of duty there must be some knowledge of God, or at least some mental conception of Deity, however false that conception may be.

Again, the *Press* says, “a nation may be Christian in its sense of duty without being Christian in its theology.” But that this is impossible appears from the fact that the sense of duty is Christian only as it springs from an acknowledgment of the authority of the Christian’s God; but without Christian teaching or Christian theology, there can be no proper conception of the true God, hence no sense of duty to him.

The whole idea of the *Press* writer evidently is that the morality inculcated by Christ should be adopted and taught in the public schools without any reference to its Author, and without giving it the added prestige of the name of Christ; that is, it would be Christianity with *Christ *left out. But there can in reality be no such thing as Christianity without Christ. Acts are *Christian* only as they spring from Christian motives. The New Testament teaches that even the common everyday acts and duties of life are to be done “to the glory of God.” It is the motive as much as the act itself which constitutes an act Christian. There can be, therefore, no such thing as Christianity with Christ left out; and no Christian would be satisfied to teach the “religion of humanity” even as Christ taught it, without telling who it was that taught it, and thus adding to it the influence of his name and nature.

Christianity is vastly more than a code of morals; it is a divine scheme for the moral elevation of men who have sinned. It not only teaches men how to live, but it teaches them how to become free from past transgression; it promises pardon for sins that are past, and gives assurance of power to overcome temptation and avoid sin in the future. Both the pardon for the past and the power for the future come through Christ. It is manifest that to leave Christ out of Christianity is to emasculate the whole system, and leave man to struggle in the slough of his own moral corruption without pardon for the past or strength for the future. The *Press *says that a nation can be Christian in its religion without being Christian in its theology; but such Christianity as that would be no better than the paganism described by the Apostle Paul in the first chapter of Romans. It is true that the State cannot properly teach theology; it is equally true that every Christian should insist that it shall not teach as Christianity or as religion, the morality inculcated by Christ, but with Christ left out. The State must in justice to all let both religion and theology alone.C. P. B.
