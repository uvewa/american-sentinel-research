THE Jesuit leaders, in their recent Baltimore Congress, decided that the Romanists of America are not yet numerous enough to risk an immediate conflict here with heretics, and the rising tide of a patriotic revival must be checked at once by conciliatory measures.

Protestant churches, political leaders, and even the great masses of citizens in the United States and Canada were becoming thoroughly alarmed at the overbearing attitude of the hierarchy of Rome, for ulterior and Satanic purposes; she now puts herself on best behavior. No class in our country will hereafter claim such exalted position because of its devotion to temperance, patriotism, "benevolence, liberality, fraternity, and charity, as Rome.

This part must be played out to the end, even if some genuine patriots detect the counterfeit imposition and continue to protest. How wisely this feature has been outlined by the following utterance of the Roman Congress in these words: "We are in favor of Catholics taking greater part than they have hitherto taken in general philanthropic and reformatory movements. There are many Christian issues in which Catholics could come together with nonCatholics, and shape civil legislation for the public weal. In spite of rebuff and injustice, and overlooking jealousy, we should seek alliance with non-Catholics for proper Sunday observance," etc.

What is the English of this? The lion has been abused by the lamb for a long time. The lion is now willing to become magnanimous, and will forgive the spites and rebuffs received from the lamb—for the present.

Rome is now to head the forces of reformation as against the licentious Mormon priesthood. Sho now poses as the party of reform! The. Protestants of America have never been able to adopt radical legislation that would entirely remove the Mormon cancer because of Roman indifference to the Mormon evil. Henceforward legislation in this direction bids fair to be thoroughly drastic in its nature.

In the past Rome has favored the introduction of the irreligious continental Sabbath to take the place of the Christian observance of that day.

Now, we may look for Congressional action that will force the people to keep the first day holy (?) by law, with severest penalties, just as Rome is now intriguing to secure the passage of a law in Japan that shall compel that whole people—men, women, and children—to be baptized into the Roman faith, officially.

Do you see any union of Church and State in these Jesuit schemes?—*The American. *[31]
