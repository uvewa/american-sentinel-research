# Memorials of 1829-30. No. 5.

## A Protest From The Legislature Of Indiana Against Sunday Legislation.

THE interest aroused in the Sunday agitation of 1829-30 can only be fully appreciated by those who went through the Sunday campaign in California in 1883, or who have read the theological conflict between Arianism and Athanasianism in the Roman Empire. Mr. Ben: Perley Poore, an old official of the United States Senate, in his “Reminiscences” (page 101), says: “The members of several religious denominations were prominent in their demonstrations, and *in Philadelphia, chains secured by padlocks, were stretched across the streets on Sundays* to prevent the passage of the mail coaches.” Is it a wonder that such fanaticism called forth the remonstrances which are here being presented?

The “reiterated and untiring efforts” of these religio-political agitators, who were flooding Congress with petitions, began to assume a serious aspect. So much so that the Legislature of the State of Indiana considered that a formal remonstrance on its part was demanded. It accordingly passed the following memorial, which was transmitted by the Governor, February 15, 1830, to the parties mentioned in the resolution:—

## MEMORIAL OF THE STATE OF INDIANA.

> The memorial of the General Assembly of the State of Indiana respectfully represents:

> That we view all attempts to introduce sectarian influence into the councils of the Nation as a violation of both the letter and the spirit of the Constitution of the United States and of this State, and at the same time dangerous to our civil and religious liberties, inasmuch as those charters secure to every man the free exercise of his religion and the right to worship the Almighty God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and inasmuch as any legislative interference in matters of religion would be an infraction of those rights.
> We, therefore, most respectfully remonstrate against any attempt, by a combination of one or more sects, to alter the laws providing for the transportation of the mail, and against the passage of a law to regulate or enforce the observance of religious duties, or which may interfere with what belongs to the conscience of each individual.
> That all legislative interference in matters of religion is contrary to the genius of Christianity; and that there are no doctrines or observances inculcated by the Christian religion which require the arm of the civil power either to enforce or sustain them.
> That we consider every connection between Church and State at all times dangerous to civil and religious liberty; and, further.
> That we cordially agree to and approve of the able report of the Hon. R. M. Johnson, adopted by the Senate of the United States at its last session, upon the petitions for prohibiting the transportation of the mail on Sunday; and while we protest in the most solemn manner against every attempt to en force, by legislative interference, the observance of any particular day, yet we believe that both the spiritual and temporal interest of mankind is promoted by setting apart one day in the week for the purpose of rest, religious instruction and the worship of God.
> *Resolved,* That his excellency the Governor, be requested to transmit a copy of the foregoing memorial to each of our Senators and Representatives [397] in Congress, and to the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of Representatives.”
The result of these memorials was to bring forth the celebrated report of the House Committee on Post-offices and Postroads, of which Colonel Johnson, of Kentucky, was chairman at this time. The report was even more emphatic than that which the Senate had adopted the previous session. Thus meeting a signal defeat again, the movement considered that the opposition was too strong at that stage of our history, and reluctantly retired to the background until a more convenient time and a people less jealous of their liberties should come upon the stage of action; and then, profiting by their former defeat, to enter the struggle with renewed vigor, and to tear down as far as possible the secular features of our Government. May their present and all future attempts be as successful as was the celebrated Sunday movement of 1829-30 is the patriotic wish of
