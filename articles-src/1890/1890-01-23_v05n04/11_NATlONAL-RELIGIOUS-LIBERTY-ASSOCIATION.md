# NATlONAL RELIGIOUS LIBERTY ASSOCIATION.

## Declaration Of Principles.

> We believe in the religion taught by Jesus Christ.

> We believe in temperance, and regard the liquor traffic as a curse to society.
> We believe in supporting the civil government, and submitting to its authority.
> We deny the right of any civil government to legislate on religious questions.
> We believe it is the right, and should be the privilege, of every man to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience.
> We also believe it to be our duty to use every lawful and honorable means to prevent religious legislation by the civil government; that we and our fellow-citizens may enjoy the inestimable blessings of both religious and civil liberty.
C. ELDREDGE,*President.*

W. H. MCKEE,*Secretary.*

THE Minneapolis *Journal* reports a dispatch from Winnipeg, Manitoba, which says: “The most important judgment ever given in Manitoba was delivered by Judge Killam, November 24, in the celebrated appeal of the Roman Catholics against an Act passed by the last Legislature abolishing separate schools. The decision is against the Catholics, but the case will be appealed to England, as the Catholics will not be satisfied until a decision is obtained there.” [399-400]

JOSEPH COOK says: “With, a glorious American common school system and a glorious American church, there can be a glorious American Republic; not otherwise.” What does Mr. Cook mean by “a glorious American church”? Does he mean a church established by law and supported by the State as the schools are established and supported?

A LETTER from Salem, Oregon, brings the intelligence that Mr. Crafts has arranged to have a Sunday bill introduced into the Legislature of that State at its next session, which begins January 12, 1891. If we mistake not the gentleman who is to have charge of the bill will find that he has a big job on his hands. The friends of religious liberty are awake in Oregon.

AUSTIN, Minnesota, is agitated over the fact that Sunday work has been done on the new public school building in that town. The Methodist Sunday school recently adopted a series of resolutions denouncing the work as “a flagrant violation of the law, and an outrage upon the religious sentiment of this community, and an open assault upon the American Sabbath.”

THE *Christian at Work* remarks that “the Baptists, the only evangelical denomination that was not represented in the recent meeting in New York, at which it was unanimously agreed that church property should not be taxed, considered the question at a meeting in Baltimore on the 24th ult. All the Baptist ministers in Baltimore agreed that church property should be taxed, but differed as to the manner in which the tax should be imposed.”

OUR readers will remember that in our issue of November 27, we made brief mention of the arrest of two men, Robert Gibb and William Fritz, in Howard County, Missouri, for doing farm work on Sunday. They were placed under bonds for their appearance at the Circuit Court December 2, 1890. The State Attorney, in his official zeal, forgot, or was ignorant of, an exemption clause for seventh-day observers in the legal code of Missouri. In the interim he seems to have informed himself upon this point, for when the day set for the trial arrived, he entered a *nolle prosequi*, the State paying the costs. Large delegations had come from the surrounding country to witness the trial.

MONDAY, December 1, the American Sabbath Union filed its certificate of incorporation. Its object is “to have the Sabbath generally observed as a day of rest and worship.” “The founders of the Union are General O. O. Howard, Postmaster-General John Wanamaker, Col. Elliott F. Shepard, J. F. Hurst, J. M. King, Edward G. Andrews, Robert S. MacArthur, A. C. Widekind, Leighton Williams, Robert C. Alexander, W. R. Worrell, Alexander S. Bacon, and Chief Justice Noah Davis.”

It will be observed that in stating the object of the Union its incorporators say, “To have the Sabbath generally observed as a day of rest and worship.” They appeal to the law-making power to enable them to accomplish their object, therefore they appeal to the State to cause men to worship.

THE second annual session of the American Sabbath Union was held in Philadelphia on the 8th and 9th insts. The session was a stormy one and anything but creditable to the management. Mr. Crafts, who made the Union, broke with it several months since, and labored independently in the West during the summer and fall. The meeting was, it appears, appointed early in the week, to shut out Western delegates, who were, as a rule, favorable to Mr. Crafts and hostile to the New York management. Nevertheless the Crafts men were there in sufficient numbers to seriously divide the flock, notwithstanding the fact that they had a Shepard (Colonel Elliott F.) over them.

Colonel Shepard was re-elected President; the incorporation secured before the meeting was approved; a board of twenty- one directors were elected; and the Constitution amended in several important particulars; but the outlook for the Union is not promising. Jealousies and dissensions are weakening it, and unless wiser counsels prevail during the coming year than appeared in the Philadelphia meeting, their bond of union may prove a rope of sand.

THE Sabbath Association of Pennsylvania seems not to have had perfectly clear sailing at its recent meeting in Pittsburg: Rev. D. S. Kennedy had been placed upon the programme for an address, which would probably never have been made had the managers of the meeting known beforehand just what Mr. Kennedy was going to say; for he vigorously opposed Sunday legislation; deprecated the idea of making- people moral by civil law, and asked the assembled delegates if their interest in the Sabbath was due to any human enactment. We regret that we have not a copy of Mr. Kennedy’s speech, as we should like very much to publish it. If all ministers had as clear views of the proper relations between Church and State, and of the appropriate sphere of civil law, THE SENTINEL would not need to be published, and the so-called Sabbath Unions might go out of business, and the energy required to run them could be devoted to legitimate Christian work.

WE not only admit, but we maintain the right of the State to establish an educational qualification for voters. But it would not purify politics. Educated men are pretty equally divided between the two great parties, and so are the ignorant and the vicious; indeed the latter are dangerous to the country only as they are manipulated and used by the former. Many of the ignorant are honest, and many of the educated are dishonest.

THE King’s Daughters, an organization which, we regret to say, is hand in glove with the National Reformers, has a membership of over one hundred and sixty thousand. This order comprises an “unsectarian body of Christian women,” having for their original object the advancement of religion and charity. But like the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union they are spending time, money, and energy on side issues.

ARCHBISHOP RYAN is credited with the following: “If all the people of the country were Catholics, and all politicians good, pious men, then such union [union of Church and State] would produce good effects, but as the world is at present, it is better to have them separate and let them work out their ends.”
