IF Sunday were a divine institution, that is, if its observance were a duty which man owed to God, there are two reasons against compelling observance by civil law: 1. It is an insult to God. It says virtually that the Lord's way is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the case, without man's interference. God requires heart work, free service, freely given, with the source of all good motives, a pure heart, behind the deeds. Anything less than this is not acceptable to him, and law and penalties can never compel love.

2. It is oppressive to those who may not agree with the law makers. The violator of a Sunday law may be just as conscientious, and just as good a husband, father, neighbor, friend, or citizen, in every respect, as the makers of a Sunday law, except in respect of the law under consideration, and in this respect the difference between them is drawn by those who, being in the majority, are able, by the brute maxim, "Might makes right," to lord it over those who are in the minority, and, hence, politically weaker. They really put themselves in the place of God by dictating to men religious duty, They show the most overweening selfishness in saying to others, You must do thus and so, because we wish you to do it. And unrestrained selfishness in political matters always means tyranny. In the first case it is putting man in the place of God, arrogating to him responsibilities and powers belonging only to God: and in the second place it is transgressing the golden rule, "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." No Christian would have an infidel compel him to be an infidel; why do professed Christians seek to compel the infidel to observe a religious institution repugnant to his conscience?

If Sunday is not a divine requirement, it is equally wicked to enforce it. Man has no right under the second reason given above to compel his brother to observe any religious institution which he would not be willing his brother should compel him to observe if circumstances were the reverse. All civil Sunday laws, or Sabbath laws, are wicked and wicked only.—*Signs of the Times.*
