THE secretary of Publications and Legislation of the American Sabbath Union, has issued a circular in which he says: "Some churches have appropriated a hundred dollars for the prevention of heathenizing America by Sabbath reform." Well, the AMERICAN SENTINEL appropriates more than twice that amount every week, for the prevention of the heathenizing of America by such Sabbath reform as is represented by the American Sabbath Union. We know of one church that appropriates yet more than this for the same purpose. And let the good work go on.
