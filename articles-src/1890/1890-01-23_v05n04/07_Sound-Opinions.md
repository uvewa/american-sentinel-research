# Sound Opinions.

THE *Christian Inquirer*, a Baptist paper published in this city, has in its issue of December 4, a symposium on the proper attitude of Baptists as to religious instruction in the public schools, from which we take the following extracts:—

> Baptists have stoutly maintained from the beginning the doctrine of the independence of Church and State. Loyalty to that doctrine forbids the teaching of religion by the State as clearly as it forbids the the assumption of civil functions by the Church. “Religion” is a word which needs definition, and if the State be allowed to define it she will always do so in the interests of the dominant ecclesiasticism, which may be, as it often has been, godless. That we may keep God in the State let us keep religion out of its control; and rather than sanction the authority of civil Government as a religious teacher we shall do well to adopt the parochial school system, and transfer control of all education from the State to the churches. But the public school system of the American Union is the direct outgrowth of religious liberty, and its most glorious expression. It furnishes a common sphere in which religion can be illustrated but not taught, adorned, but not enforced, and if the churches are half alive within their proper domain society can receive only blessing from such so-called secular schools.

Church and State are separate, though each reacts upon the other. The functions of the State are civil, of the Church religious. The public school is a civil institution supported by the State. No religious instruction, therefore, can be given in it. The State can no more teach religion than the Church can make laws. Through the home and schools of its own the Church must care for the religious training of the young. Intelligence being the basis of true citizenship the State must educate, but for the State to attempt to teach religion is simply to furnish a valid plea to any sectarian body to demand a division of the school fund.

> W. W. BOYD.

> *Newark, N. **J.*
Our convictions and teaching in regard to “religious liberty” compel us to hold that no religious tenets of any sort shall be taught in the public schools. Absolutely equal rights must prevail in an institution supported by public taxation.

> NATHAN E. WOOD.

> *Brooklyn, N. Y.*
I strongly favor giving up the reading of the Bible in public schools. That seems to me clearly the Baptist policy—separating Church from State. Equally clearly is it the best policy, disarming all reasonable opposition to the schools. Much has been lost in not resorting to it earlier.

> E. BENJ. ANDREWS.

> *Brown University.*
For the public school teacher as such to teach religion as a part of his duty to the State is for him to usurp a function which does not belong to the State; to concede the claim of the papal Church; to play the tyrant; to degrade religion by unholy alliance. The formal teaching of religion in State schools is not Americanism, not Christianity, but Hildebrandism, State-Churchism.
