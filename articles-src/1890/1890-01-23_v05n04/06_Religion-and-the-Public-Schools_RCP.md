THE renewal of the Blair Educational Amendment Resolution, and Sunday-Rest Bill before the Fifty-first Congress is causing many thoughtful men to reflect seriously as to the proper relation of the Church and the State, and religion and the public schools.

The following extract from a sermon preached in Minneapolis, December 22, by Rev. M. D. Shutter, and published in the Minneapolis *Times,* December 23, is very much to the point, and is worthy of a perusal. Mr. Shutter said:—

> "I take my stand upon the principle that the State has no right to teach in its public schools, or anywhere else, the Christian religion, or any other, according to any man's interpretation. The State has absolutely no authority in religion. It can do nothing more than protect the worshiper in his religious rights. It protects him as a citizen and not as a Christian, a Jew, or a Mohammedan. It has no right to favor or advance his views by legislation or appropriations. It has no more right to authorize a teacher in its schools to give religious instruction than it has to send missionaries to the heathen, The State has no more right to appropriate a dollar to religious institutions than it has to compel a man to attend church. The State is simply and solely secular. It is organized to help men to secure their natural and advance their temporal interests. It is as distinctly secular as a railroad corporation, a banking institution, or an insurance company. Its sphere is confined to this world. With the soul's hereafter it has no concern.

> "Are we not a 'Christian nation?' Only in the sense that Christianity is the religion adopted by the majority of our citizens for their own personal guidance and comfort; in no other sense. 'Christian nation' has a pious sound, and the man who uses it commonly thinks he has rolled an unmovable stone upon the sepulcher of the secular State.
> "When we admit the doctrine of a secular State, the doctrine upon which this Nation was founded, the doctrine of a secular school follows. Let us understand that the word ' godless ' does not necessarily mean, as those who use it would fain have us believe, 'ungodly.' The school may not be religious in any formal sense, and yet it need not be, and it is not 'irreligious.' A literary society does not formally recognize God and the Bible; but it is not an ungodly or an irreligious organization. It has its own peculiar purpose and aim. Its purpose does not happen to include anything of a religious nature, but to stigmatize it for this reason as irreligious and ungodly, would be the last logic of fanaticism.
> "Then let the Church think well of her instrumentalities, her wealth, her power, her influence. Let her quit complaining and go to work. Let her not seek to force the State to do for her that which lies in her own special province. The more the Church relies on the arm of secular power for the promotion of her interests, the more she confesses her weakness. It is a sign of degeneracy and not of strength. When the arm of temporal power becomes in any sense or in any degree a substitute for the spirit of the truth, the blight of death is upon the Church."
Our Nation, built upon the platform of a total separation between the Church and the State, has enjoyed unparalleled prosperity in both for more than a century. Let the separation continue, and she may hope for continued progress; but let the State be called to support the Church by civil enactments and the Church will lose her power, and the State will stain her judicial ermine. Let every American citizen read the history of the results of such a union in the fourth century and take warning.R. C. PORTER.
