EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL: I must have been very slow to appreciate the work of the SENTINEL though I have seen it occasionally since its start. It seemed to me that its utterances might apply to *some *branches of the Church; but that my own particular church and pastor were implicated in a wrong movement I was slow to believe. There must be thousands of candid men in our country who, through a settled faith in the integrity of their church, are, like I have been, slow to realize that the original method of preaching the gospel is being departed from.

Perhaps some of the ministers in the departure do not realize the sin of partnership in such business. The Word tells us that the heart of man is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked to the extent that no one can fully know it, and if this is the case we need not be surprised at almost any, yes, *any,* depth of iniquity in anyone to whom the above scripture will apply. History shows that the most gigantic systems of oppression and wrong through which "man's inhumanity to man has made countless thousands mourn" [29] have been systems of religion which the terribly deceitful heart of man had perverted to destroy instead of to bless mankind. They have all, however, claimed to bless at the time their destroying influence was in operation. To do less would be to admit their own insincerity.

I am sorry to state that I have noticed my own dear minister of late getting a certain strange excited spirit in talking of the victories of the Church. I can compare it to nothing more like than to a man intoxicated with wine who seems to be strangely hopeful and exhilarated, while the grounds for his expectancy are not apparent to the sober observers not under the influence of his drink. By the connections with his remarks upon the coming conquests of the Church it is shown that he has imbibed the wine of National Reform. He no longer seeks to win men by telling what ought to be the welcome news of salvation, but is apparently infatuated with quicker and more wholesale methods which seem to lead a shorter path to glory than the old way of our fathers. All the victories for the Church I see recorded come through faith alone. I see no plan to redeem man from the world of sin except that he shall *believe* the word of God.

Is it possible that in this land where Bibles are as plenty as bread that people do not have an *opportunity* to believe? Even without the Bibles there are enough professed Christians in our land to acquaint the remainder of the population with the principles of Christianity in a few days if necessary; and so give all a chance to believe. I know of no other commission ever given to the ambassadors of Christ but that they should give people a *chance to believe.* I am struck dumb with amazement that his professed ambassadors should go beyond their Lord's commission and do that which only faithless, disbelieving servants would dare do, viz.: devise from their own selfish hearts, plans for the salvation of man and victories for the Church. Such a course can only in the end provoke the wrath of the long-suffering Master and cause him to bring it down on his guilty shepherds.

How much better it would be to wait patiently, entreating and beseeching all men meanwhile "for Christ's sake to be reconciled to God" as did the faithful apostle Paul. Victory for the Church will come when those who, as individuals make up the Church, get the victory over their sinful, unbelieving hearts. How strange, beyond words to express, it is, that any reader of the Scriptures should ever think of it coming in any other way.

From the above quotation about the human heart, we need not be surprised at a new method of uniting Church and State. To be themselves deceived as well as to deceive others, it would be necessary for some more elaborate and acute plan than has heretofore been practiced. America is a land of wonderful inventions and expedients in human effort, and it would be strange if in a union of Church and State here, the old beaten track should be followed. The accumulated wisdom of centuries will obviously be brought into use in accomplishing it. Here is, I think, the danger of some, with their eyes on what has been the form of union of Church and State, they may let the real iniquitous substance of that very thing pass the bar of their judgment unchallenged, because in another form. Why should we not expect unparalleled acuteness and subtilty in this movement? But is not the question with all men who feel that they must judge rightly, Will an ingenious plan lessen in any degree the guilt?

W. S. RITCHIE.
