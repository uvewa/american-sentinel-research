RELIGIOUS questions are not ordinarily proper subjects of political criticism and discussion, but when embodied in bills and resolutions and introduced into Congress they become political issues that must be met, discussed and decided upon their political merits.

Such measures as the "Sunday Rest Bill," and "Religious Amendment," introduced by Senator Blair in the 50th Congress, and recently re-introduced by him in the present session, drag these religious questions from the domain of theological discussion, where they belong, and thrust them into the arena of politics, where they must be subjected to the criticism, discussion and settlement of political questions. These issues are forced upon the people of the United States by a direct attack upon the fundamental principles of free government. Our Constitution recognizes the absolute equality of all its citizens; equality, not in physical development, mental acumen, nor social standing, but in their rights. Our Government as the conservator of the rights of all its citizens, guarantees to its humblest citizen, and to the weakest minority, all the rights accorded to its most prominent citizens and largest majorities.

No partiality is admissible. Wealth, numbers, physical perfection and social prominence are alike denied standing room upon the scales of justice, and absolute equality of rights is made the bed-rock of all our free institutions.

In recognition of the inherent and indefeasible right of every citizen to be protected in the independent exercise and free expression of his religious convictions, our Constitution wisely withholds from Congress the power to legislate upon religious subjects, and only restrains the liberty of the individual when he seeks to invade the rights of others. The success of the Blair measures involves the subversion of these principles and the removal of the constitutional barrier that now protects the weak from oppression by the strong.

The full text of these proposed measures should be published broadcast and all the avenues of intelligent expression opened wide for their full and free discussion. *—Ira D. Blanchard, in Polk County (Minn.) Journal. *[32]
