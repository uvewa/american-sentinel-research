# Sunday Mails.

A WESTERN Pennsylvania clergyman has been criticising Wanamaker as an ungodly public servant for allowing the mails over which he has the supervision to be carried on Sunday. To this charge Wanamaker has made a reply, in which he repudiates responsibility for the offense and refers the clergyman to Congress as the body with whom authority in the matter resides. He also takes occasion to say that in his opinion Sunday rest for mails in transit is impracticable. “To stop the handling of Sunday mails,” he says, “means to stop the wheels of the railroads throughout the country at twelve o’clock on Saturday. In that event there would be no protection for mails in transit. Hundreds of thousands of dollars pass through the mails every day, and the custody of the mail in a car standing on the track, while crossing the prairie, or even at a small village, would be a serious matter. It would be a great accomplishment for Sunday rest if the mail dispatched from Omaha or San Francisco could lay up at twelve o’clock Saturday night, but what would become of the postal clerks, engineers, and train hands is not clear.”

We have not seen the full text of Wanamaker’s reply to the clergyman; but he is abridged as saying that if any community, by the petition of a considerable majority of its population, would ask for the absolute closing of its office on Sunday the request would receive favorable consideration. “Still,” he adds, “it must be remembered that the post-office is not a private office, and that it is the duty of its servants to serve according to law,” and he admits... “that those who have different views of Sunday keeping have a right to consideration.”

Mr. Wanamaker’s recognition of the truth that the post-office is not a private office, to be open or closed according to the religious prejudices of the postmaster and his fellow church members, marks quite a long step in the direction of sense. . . . He might now go farther and declare that the post-office is not a religious office, and that therefore religious reverence for Sunday cannot be regarded as a good excuse for stopping mail trains on that day. People who do not want their mail carried on Sunday should deposit it on Monday morning. It is not practicable for ships to lay-to over the holy day, but mails will go anywhere from the Atlantic to the Pacific between one Sunday and the next.*—Freethought.*
