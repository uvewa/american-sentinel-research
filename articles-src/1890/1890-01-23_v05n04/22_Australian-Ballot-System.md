OPPOSITION without being able to show a reason for it is the position of the San Francisco *Chronicle* on the Australian ballot system. The truth is that the Jesuit organ is opposed to this method of voting because the Catholic Church is opposed to it. The system was designed for the purpose of defeating the influence of the priest in politics. In Australia the Papal Church wielded such a powerful influence over voters on election day that the people were compelled in self-defense to devise a means that would defeat the manipulations of the priests on election day. What is known as the Australian system of voting was the means adopted, and it has served the purpose so well that in Australia the priest no longer wields a power at the polls. The *Chronicle* will not acknowledge why it opposes the system.—*American Standard.* [33]
