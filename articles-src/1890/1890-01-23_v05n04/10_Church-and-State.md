THE Bishop of Marseilles, in France, has seen fit to issue to the clergy of his diocese a circular telling them that while the election of deputies is a political matter it is a sin to vote ill. Following this the Minister of Public Worship issued a circular calling the attention of the French bishops to the law, and pointed out to them that priests are forbidden to interfere with political matters or to exercise pressure upon the consciences of their flocks. To the people of the United States, born and educated under a representative form of government, the whole question of Church and State seems a very simple one. The inborn and ingrained sentiment of the American people is that elections are not matters of ethics, but matters of politics, and that if any religious teacher, no matter what he may be called, desires to take any part in them it must be as a citizen, and in no other capacity. The priest of any religion has an undoubted right to denounce a bad man who is a candidate for office, but that right depends upon his being a good citizen, not upon his holding a religious office, and his right is not superior to that of any other good citizen.

France can never be genuinely republican until the divorce between Church and State is made absolute. No matter what may be the prevailing sentiment there, whether a majority of the people be Catholic or Protestant or Israelite or Agnostic, the teachers of religion, as such, have no right to interfere in any way in the elections, for to do so is to destroy the fundamental idea of popular government.—*San Francisco Chronicle.*
