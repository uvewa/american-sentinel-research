THE Ridgewood Amusement Company of Queens County, N. Y., leased their grounds for playing base-ball and the clubs played on Sunday. The grand jury indicted the company for maintaining a nuisance in allowing Sunday base-ball. The company made no denial of letting the grounds nor of letting them for the purpose of playing base-ball, nor that baseball was played there on Sunday. The company denied that it was a nuisance and brought many citizens and some officials, all residents, who testified that it was not a nuisance. Of course, the prosecution failed to convict. The American Sabbath Union is considerably annoyed at this, and says, "Every lawyer knows that it is a much more difficult matter to convict for maintaining a nuisance than it is to convict for Sabbath-breaking. The indictment should have been for Sabbath-breaking." But Sabbath-breaking is distinctly an offense against God. It is essentially a religious offense and no man is responsible to any soul on this earth for Sabbath breaking; and when the power of the State is employed to deal with the offense of Sabbath breaking that power is carried entirely beyond every limit that properly pertains to the jurisdiction of civil government.
