THE Philadelphia Sabbath Association held its Fiftieth Anniversary, Sunday and Monday, April 27 and 28. Rev. Dr. J. A. Hoyt, pastor of the Chambers Presbyterian Church, delivered the speech of welcome, in which he said:—

> How strange that an institution born with the creation, adorned with moral law and brightened with the light of the resurrection, should need support! Yet it is so, like that other sacred institution of the past, marriage. Man has trampled upon both, and it is necessary to make an effort to force men to realize the great gift of God.

This is just what we have been telling the people for years. We have known all the time that the Sunday-law movement was only an effort to force men to recognize God and the religious obligations of Sunday. Just how much force will be required to cause men fully and properly to realize the great gift of God, Mr. Hoyt did not attempt to tell. That doubtless is left for consideration when the law, and the power to use such force, shall have been obtained. Then how much force shall be used can readily be decided by the ecclesiastical managers.
