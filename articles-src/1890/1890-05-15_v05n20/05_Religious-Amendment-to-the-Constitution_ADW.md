SENATOR BLAIR'S proposed amendment is to force into all the public schools the teaching of the principles of Christianity. This arrangement is open to many objections.

1. It is a proposition to have the State undertake a work which, outside of the family, belongs only to the Church. This is the chief characteristic of a union of Church and State. Civil affairs belong to the State; religious affairs belong to God and the Church; "render therefore unto Cesar the things which are Cesar's; and unto God the things which are Gods." Matt. 22:21.

2. In the matter of the religious training of children, it "puts the State not only in the place of the parent, but above the parent." As God holds the parents responsible for their children, it is evident that they should be allowed to train the children as they believe God requires, without any interference of the State.

3. It proposes to use carnal weapons (force) to propagate religion. Christ says, "Whosoever will, let him take the water of life," but the advocates of the amendment intend to compel people to study religion whether they desire to or not.

4. The first amendment to the Constitution says, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;" but the proposed amendment would change this by compelling Congress and the State Legislatures to make laws for the establishment of the principles of Christianity in all the public schools.

5. The Blair amendment does not define these "principles," which would necessitate a succession of church councils, similar to those convened in the Dark Ages, or the introduction into our civil courts of an endless chain of religious litigation, to settle the disputes constantly arising among the people.— *A.
