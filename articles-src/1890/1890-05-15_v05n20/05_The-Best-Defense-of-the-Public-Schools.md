# The Best Defense of the Public Schools.

THE friends of the public-school system have need to be on the alert. Its enemies are active, and will destroy the best scheme of public education ever devised, if not resisted. But we must not only defend it against its enemies; we must save it from some of its friends. No small part of the present agitation concerning it is due to that class of its professed friends who are fighting outside of the legitimate lines of defense. For example, a protest has been made because the mayor of this city appointed a Roman Catholic as School Commissioner in place of another Roman Catholic. This protest would be legitimate, if the new commissioner were opposed to our public schools and wished to break them down. But there is no evidence that this is the fact, nor is it even alleged. In the absence of any such proof it is manifestly unfair and unjust, and savors of religious proscription to insist that no Roman Catholic shall serve on a public school board. The strong defense of the public school is that it *is* public, for the benefit of all without distinction of race or religion. There is no other ground upon which to justify the taxation of people of all races and religions for its support. Catholics are taxed for it, Catholics patronize it extensively, and Catholics as such should not be excluded from its management. This is an impregnable position for the friends of the public school to take. If they take it and adhere to it they will compel all enemies to surrender.—*Independent.*

> *Any invasion of the rights of another done of purpose is persecution. Any invasion of the rights of others, by large bodies, is none the less persecution; and when these rights are rights of conscience, it is persecution, and the men who suffer from it feel it as persecution the moment their attention is addressed to it. The moment that a Jew becomes aware that his taxes are appropriated to a form of worship alien to his faith, and which teaches its falsehood, he is persecuted, and it is only a question of time and humanity whether those who persecute him shall be persuaded to persecute him more.*
