IN studying the subject of the Bible in the public schools, there are two important questions to solve; first, which, if any, of the Bibles shall be used? and second, what are the public schools?

The Bible, to many, means only the Bible adopted by the Protestants, or the King James version, and in urging that it be read in the common schools, they do not recognize the fact that the Catholic has a different Bible, which he regards as the only faithful translation of the Scriptures; or that the Jew accepts of the Old Testament only, regarding the New not only as false, but as cruelly charging his ancestors with the murder of the world's Messiah.

The difference between these Bibles is considered by each party as vital to the eternal welfare of the believer. Says the Protestant Bible, "Except ye *repent,* ye shall all likewise perish." Says the Catholic Bible, "Unless ye shall *do penance, *ye shall all likewise perish."

This is not an accidental difference in translation but is a difference maintained throughout the entire Catholic Bible, based on the distinctive Catholic doctrine of penance, in opposition to the Protestant doctrine of salvation through faith, as the following quotation from the "Doctrinal Catechism," proves: "He [Luther] invented a thing, which he called justifying faith, to be a sufficient substitute for all the above painful religious works, an invention which took off every responsibility from our shoulders, and laid all on the shoulders of Jesus Christ; in a word, he told men to believe in the merits of Christ as *certainly applied to them,* and live as they pleased."—*Page 37.*

There are other important differences which appear in the text, and would be made apparent by the mere reading of the passages.

The difference between the Protestant and Catholic Bibles, and the Jewish Bible, is far greater, as the Jew rejects the entire New Testament as not only a base fabrication, but as containing an unjust charge against his people.

The infidel rejects the whole, and finds his views of religion met in the writings of Rousseau, Paine, or Ingersoll.

Which of these Bibles shall be read in our common schools? To this question comes a chorus of opposing answers.

Who shall decide? Is it the prerogative of the State to decide which of these Bibles contains the most truth, and which error? If we so decide, we adopt the theory which gave to the Dark Ages their moral gloom.

Leaving the difference in Bibles, there is another important difference with regard to the propriety of reading any Bible without comment. The Protestant position is, that "the Bible without note or comment is the infallible rule of faith and practice." The Catholic regards this as a dangerous doctrine, fraught with eternal ruin to the child, and to say that he is not sincere, is to sit in judgment on his conscience. And the conscience of a Catholic is as sacred in the eyes of the law as the conscience of the Protestant.

In studying this subject, we should not allow our preconceived ideas, or time- honored practices to prejudice us. The time was, when men as conscientiously believed that the Government should protect religion by burning heretics, as do some to-day that the Bible should be read in the public schools. One way of bringing this question squarely before us is to reverse the condition by placing the Catholic, Jew, or infidel in the majority. Would the Protestant, who believes that salvation comes alone through faith, be willing that his child be taught from the reading of the Douay Bible, that to obtain it, he must do penance? If infidels were in the majority, would the minority be willing to have the exercises of the day prefaced by the reading of extracts from Thomas Paine, Robert Ingersoll, or some other exponent of infidelity? Here it is that the golden rule has a practical application. "All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them."

The public school is created and maintained by the civil Government, and therefore is a civil institution. Protestants, Catholics, Jews, and infidels are taxed alike for its support. They are not maintained in the interests of or in opposition to religion, As a part of the Government they come under Lincoln's immortal definition of government,—they are "of the people, by the people, and for the people." They are neither by or for the Protestant, as such, but for the people without [157] reference to religion. Since the support of the public school is compulsory as is the attendance upon it in most States, it follows that the parent is compelled to maintain, and patronize a place of worship, for such is the school room while the Bible is being read. In other words he is taxed to support an institution which destroys the faith of his child, and is compelled to send his child to an institution where its faith will be destroyed. This is the worst of tyranny.

While this view of the public school is regarded by the majority as self-evident, there are a few who, because of this attitude of our schools toward religion, declare that they are "godless." This comes from a misconception of the mission of the public school. Had God delegated to the civil Government the teaching of religion, a failure to do it by means of the public school would merit the above criticism. The State in providing for the teaching of reading, writing, and mathematics without teaching religion is simply attending to its legitimate business which the Church does when it attends to the teaching of religion. The term "godless," cannot be applied with any more consistency to the common school, because the Bible is not read or taught in it, than it can be to schools of phonography, telegraphy, or art, because the Bible is not taught or read in them. The place for the Bible to be read and taught is in the home, the denominational school, and the church.—*Home Missionary.*
