A MILWAUKEE preacher argues that "The Church should stand as an arbiter between capital and labor and try to get them together." The Church should do no such thing; such is not her place in the world. Christ was once asked to do that very thing (Luke 12:13, 14), and he flatly refused to perform any such office. And the disciple is not above his Master, nor the servant greater than his Lord; it is enough that the disciple be as his Master, and the servant as his Lord. What a singular thing it is that professed ministers of the gospel will take positions and announce doctrines that are directly repudiated by the very Author of their profession.
