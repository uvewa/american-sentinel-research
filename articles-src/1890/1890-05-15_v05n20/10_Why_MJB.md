WHY should *anything* based upon the word of God ask for support other than that word? It cannot. It is only when we realize weakness in ourselves that we look elsewhere for support. When the Church asks the civil power to compel people to yield obedience to her ordinances, then those ordinances have become *forms,* and forms only, lacking in power to affect the heart, and inspire the life.

This is no less true of one ordinance than of another. Shall civil power compel people to be baptized and join the Church? No! Then, shall it compel people to keep the Sabbath? If the Church has lost her power to convert the heart, so that it shall yield *willing* obedience to her Lord; if she must ask civil power to compel service to her forms; then how sadly yet truly are the words of Paul being fulfilled, "Having a* form* of godliness but denying the *power* thereof."
