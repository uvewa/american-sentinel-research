THE Society of Working Girls held a convention in this city several days ago, and in the convention it was stated that in Philadelphia a girls' class in stained glass had been stopped by the Glass Workers' Union, upon which the *Independent *justly remarks:—

"This is an extraordinary statement. We can hardly imagine how it could be done except by terrorizing the teacher who may have been a member of the Glass Workers' Union. The Union which attempts to prevent children from learning trades, which fights against its own sons and daughters is cowardly and silly as well. The hope of the country rests in the education of its youth into intelligent bread-winning activities."
