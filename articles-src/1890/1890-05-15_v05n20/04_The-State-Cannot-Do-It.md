# The State Cannot Do It.

EDUCATION is defective if the spiritual nature is neglected. We all ought to insist on this. Shall we then insist on introducing religious instruction into the schools of the State? By no means. Why? Because the State does not purpose to give complete education. The State aims to improve the citizen and not to perfect the man. It does this for its own efficiency and protection. But is not the citizen based on the man? Yes. Is not morality an element of good citizenship? Yes. Is not morality based on religion? Yes. Why, then, does not the State aim at perfecting the man for the sake of the citizen? Why does not the State teach religion in order to foster morality which is so essential to good citizenship?

We answer: The State does not undertake to teach religion, because it knows that it cannot. The State is by its very nature unqualified for teaching religion or for completing the education of a human being. No cause can produce an effect different in kind from itself. No force reaches higher than its own source. Bread feeds the body and not the mind. Truth feeds the mind and not the body. Social influences effect the social nature only. Moral results are produced by moral forces and by no other. In order to awaken, nourish and train the spiritual, we must have a spiritual power. Now, the State is a civil power. It exists for civil purposes. Its functions, its agencies, its rewards and its punishments are civil. But man is a moral and spiritual as well as a social and industrial being. The moral and spiritual require moral and spiritual forces for their education. These the State does not possess, and hence the State cannot give a complete education. It cannot touch the moral and spiritual in man.

The State cannot teach morality, because it does not know morality. It does not know absolute right and wrong; it knows rights and wrongs. It does not know absolute goodness and badness; it knows the efficient and the detrimental. It does not know the holy and the sinful; it knows the loyal and the criminal. It does not know theft and murder and adultery and slander as wrong; it knows [149] them as wrongs, as infractions of the rights of others, and as hurtful to the body politic. Thus not having a cognition of morality, it is impossible for the State to teach morality.

In like manner, the State does not know religion. It does not know dependence on God, obligation, responsibility, duty, love, or obedience to God. These all are personal cognitions and experiences. Persons having them may, and frequently do, organize on them as a basis and for their cultivation. The Church is such an organization. But such a society the State is not. It is based on cognitions and experiences entirely different and for entirely other purposes. Persons who do not have these cognitions and experiences, and who deny the possibility of having them, belong to the State. ... A religious character is impossible for a nation. The phrase “a Christian nation” is absurd. If every man, woman, and child in the State were a Christian, we should then not be a Christian nation, but a nation of Christians. Christianity is not a national characteristic; it does not run in the blood. No one is a Christian in virtue of his birth of a certain race, or of citizenship in a certain State. Christianity is a personal and an acquired characteristic, and is not essential to nationality or to citizenship. The State neither knows nor recognizes religion when it exists. It is impossible, therefore for the State to teach religion; of those truths and experiences it has no cognitions.

Consider again what it is to teach morality. It is something other than the enumeration and exposition of moral duties, or than a dissertation on the philosophy of ethics. Persons may be very learned in all this, and yet be utterly wanting in moral education as the word is used in the objection of the Catholics. Moral education is the awakening of the moral nature to a vivid sense of right and wrong, to a love of right and a hatred of wrong, to a choosing of the right and a rejection of the wrong, and to a consequent constant exercise of the will in right volitions. But these results are produced by the impingement of a moral nature already educated on an unawakened moral nature. But the State has no such educated moral nature. It has no moral nature at all. It does not, it cannot, exact such an educated moral nature as a qualification in its servant the school teacher. All that it asks, or can ask, is power and aptness to impart information with an inoffensive outward conduct. For this reason the State cannot become the agent of moral education.

The same is true of religious education. This does not consist in conveying information concerning God and man, Christ and the Bible, sin and salvation, the Church and holiness. Mere knowledge of these things is utterly worthless. It improves neither the citizen nor the man. As mere knowledge, stopping with itself, it is not worth teaching at all. Religious education is the awakening of the spiritual nature of man so that he may feel his dependence on God, his obligation to God, his sin against God, and the love and mercy of God toward him in Christ Jesus, and so that he may come back to God in Christ Jesus in repentance and faith, love, consecration and obedience. This alone is that religious education which our Catholic fellow-citizens so justly tell us is essential to complete human education, and which produces the manhood and the morality so necessary to good citizenship. This education can be produced, generally speaking, only by the impingement of a spiritually educated nature, on an unawakened spiritual nature. But the State has no such educated religious nature. It has no religious nature at all. Hence, the State cannot impart the religious education here spoken of.

The best instrument for the awakening and nurture of a spiritual nature is the Bible. But the Bible is a spiritual instrument, and can be properly used only by the spiritually-minded. The carnally- minded and the worldly-minded can teach facts and truths about the Bible, and expound intellectually some of the contents of the Bible. But to use the book as a means of spiritual awakening and nurture is possible for the spiritually-minded only. The State is utterly void of this spiritual- mindedness, and hence is utterly unfit to use the Bible for religious instruction.

We are thus shut in to the conclusion that the State is not competent to give man a complete education. It has not the power, and hence it is not its function to impart moral and spiritual instruction.— *Rev. Owen James, in National Baptist.*

> *Those who preach to rulers the duty of employing power to propagate the truth, would do well to remember that falsehood, though no match for truth alone, has often been found more than a match for truth and power together.*
