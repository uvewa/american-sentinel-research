SUNDAY, April 20, in Salt Lake City, what seems to have been a sort of massmeeting was held to consider "The obligation of the civil authorities to protect the American Sabbath." The meeting was addressed by Rev. Doctors Vincent, Iliff, Thrall and Mc Neice. The Sunday movement is more than holding its own as a question of national influence.
