SUNDAY night, May 4, the Rev. A. B. Kendig, D. D., pastor of the Hanson Place Methodist Episcopal Church, Brooklyn, New York, spoke on the "National Importance of the Sabbath." One of his statements in regard to those who oppose Sunday laws was this: "We must say to them, 'If you put your finger upon the Sabbath, you die from among your fellows.'" The gospel of the Sunday-law preachers is altogether a gospel of force.
