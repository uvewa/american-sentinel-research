IT is stated that the late persecution of the Jews in Vienna became so dangerous to all shopkeepers that the city recently appeared covered with such signs as "I am a Christian Tradesman;" "Christian Brandy Shop;" "Christian Cheesemonger;" "Christian Old Clothes Shop." And that is just what we would see in this country should the hopes of the National Reformers be realized. Every thing would be metaphorically labelled, "Christian." Every corrupt politician and political "boss" in the country would be a "Christian;" we might reasonably expect the "conversion" of Tammany *en **masse*, and boodle and boodlers would rule the "Church" just as they now manipulate the wards.
