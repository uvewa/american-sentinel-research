# Orthodox Presbyterianism.

WE here present an extract from the speech of Hon. Stanley Matthews in the Cincinnati case of the Bible in the schools. In these times when Presbyterian Synods and Presbyterian papers are demanding that the State shall teach religion, and denouncing Supreme Court decisions to the contrary, it is important that the public, as well as the Presbyterians themselves, should know just what is orthodox Presbyterianism on this question. Mr. Matthews said:—

I wish, partly as a personal gratification to myself, and partly for the sound and wholesome truth conveyed in sound and wholesome words, which it contains, to read to your Honors a part of the confession of the church to which I belong, on the duties and functions of the civil magistrate. *The Westminster Confession of Faith,* chapter xxiii, section 3, says:—

> Civil magistrates may not assume to themselves the administration of the word and sacraments, or the power of the keys of the kingdom of heaven, or in the least interfere in the matters of faith. Yet, as nursing fathers, it is the duty of civil magistrates to protect the church of our common Lord without giving the preference to any denomination of Christians above the rest, in such manner that all ecclesiastical persons whatever shall enjoy the full, free and unquestioned liberty of discharging every part of their sacred functions, without violence or danger. And as Jesus Christ hath appointed a regular government and discipline in his church, no law of any commonwealth should interfere with, let or hinder the due exercise thereof among the voluntary members of any denomination of Christians, according to their own profes sion and belief. It is the duty of civil magistrates to protect the person and good name of all their people in such an effectual manner as that no person be suffered, either upon pretense of religion or infidelity, to offer any indignity, violence, abuse or injury to any other person whatsoever; and to take order that all religious and ecclesiastical assemblies be held without molestation or disturbance.

Thus, may it please your Honors, am I taught by my own church—a church which teaches elsewhere in the same confession that “God alone is lord of the conscience” —and which here plainly defines and declares its own rights and the rights of the whole Christian Church, and the limits of the civil power in respect of them; and in so doing denies to the civil magistrate any assumed right *in the administration of the word,* which means neither more nor less, than, any part or lot in instructing in religion—denies his right, *in the least, to interfere in matters of faith,* which he attempts to exert when, by law, he decrees that a particular version or translation of the Bible shall be publicly read, as part of a system of religious worship and instruction, by and to particular persons, at stated times and places, thereby implicitly sitting in judgment upon the questions relating to its inspiration, its canonical character, the accuracy of its translation, its character and claims as the word of God, and opening the way, if such a power is admitted, for a further claim, to expound, interpret and teach by authority its true meaning; denies his right to give the preference to any denomination of Christians above the rest, a right which is clearly exercised where the State authorities, school boards or courts of law imperatively ordain a form of religious devotion to be practiced, or a mode of religious instruction to be adopted, in the public and common schools, which the consciences of any Christian denomination prevent them from attending, supporting or countenancing; declares the right of every denomination of Christians, to exercise its discipline and government ecclesiastically, among its voluntary members, according to their own profession and belief, without let, hindrance or interference with, by the law of any commonwealth. . . . .

But this noble article of the Westminster Confession of Faith goes one step farther, in its vindication of the rights of conscience against the power of the civil magistrate. It recognizes and throws the mantle of its protection, not merely over rights which it claims for those whom it regards as peculiarly its own—the confessors of its own faith—but concedes the same *to all others)* even to those who deny, not only its own confession, but the very faith itself—even infidels; for it maintains it to be the duty of civil Government equally to protect and defend all the people, both in person and good name, and so effectually, that no person be suffered to offer any indignity, violence, abuse or injury to any other person whatsoever, *either upon pretense of religion or infidelity!*

In other words it is not orthodox Presbyterianism in this country, to deny to an infidel the same civil rights that belong to a saint. [152]

THE Wisconsin decision lias awakened such widespread discussion of the subject of Religion and Public Education, that we have made this number of the SENTINEL somewhat of a special upon that subject. We give to our readers some of the most valuable matter to be found upon this subject. The argument of Mr. Wigman, in the Wisconsin case, is a powerful and noble vindication of the right of the parent to instruct his own child. Judge Orton’s opinion in the same case is an excellent statement of the case of the common school. The article by Rev. Owen James is a masterly statement of the impossibility of the State’s ever having anything to do in any way, with religious instruction. And it is difficult to see how the Presbyterian Church can favor the teaching of religion in the public schools in the face of its own Confession of Faith, as so eloquently expounded by Stanley Matthews.

All these articles are most worthy of acceptance for all that they say, and for all that they mean, and in view of the condition of things in this Nation to-day, and in view of the powerful influences that are at work to secure action by the State which shall commit it to the cognizance of religious things, it is important that the principles so well set forth in the articles which we have the pleasure of presenting to our readers in this number of the SENTINEL, should be made known everywhere.

We hope all to whom this paper comes will give it the widest possible circulation.

THE Presbyterians throughout the whole United States are now discussing the question of the revision of their Confession of Faith. A great majority of those Presbyteries which have already expressed themselves, are in favor of revision. But there is one point in the Confession which we have not yet seen mentioned by any one of the Presbyteries, which will need to be revised if the position of the Presbyterian Synod of New York is orthodox. That is, the article which declares that “civil magistrates may not assume to themselves the administration of the word, or in the least interfere in the matters of faith.” If the State is to teach religion as this Synod demands that it shall, then that part of the creed needs to be so revised as to declare it to be the duty of the civil magistrate to administer the word and regulate matters of faith.

RESOLUTIONS are being adopted by ecclesiastical bodies, and many petitions are being sent to the United States Senate, urging the passage of the Blair Educational bill.

THE teaching of religion belongs to the Church, and to the Church only. God has committed to the Church this work, and endowed her with the power to do it effectively. The State has no authority to do it, nor has it the power by which, alone, the attempt to do it can be effective. This work then, having been committed to the Church, when the Church passes it over to the State and the State assumes the task, what then is the Church to do? What is there left for her to do, and what further use is there for her in the world? More than this, the Church will not stop at that. When once the State has assumed the task of carrying on and supporting the *work* of the Church, the next thing it will have to do will be to support the Church itself, and that in idleness, as every State has ever had to do, and will ever have to do, which takes upon itself the task of teaching religion. Therefore if the Government of the United States, or of any State, wants to keep forever clear of the galling burden of a lazy, good-for-nothing Church, let it keep forever clear of any attempt to teach religion.

APPARENTLY with some surprise the question is asked, Would you object to the use of the Bible in the public schools merely as a reading book? We answer decidedly, Yes. We object to the Bible’s being made less than it is, or to any impression being conveyed that it is less than that which it is. The Bible is the word of God and that is all that it is. In it is the revelation of the eternal purpose of God which he purposed in Christ Jesus for the redemption of the race of man lost and ruined by sin. It is that and that only, and to make it less than that is to make it worse than nothing. And to use it in the public schools, or anywhere else, merely as a reading book, is to put it upon a level with all other mere reading books, and is to make it less than that which it is. Such procedure conveys the impression to the minds of the children in school that the Bible is no more, and of no more worth or authority, than any other reading book; and to do that is to destroy in their minds the true idea of what the Bible is, and of what its worth and authority is. Therefore everybody who has any regard for the Bible for what it is, ought to object to its being put to any use that will convey to anybody any idea that it is less than that which it is—the word of God.

THE Presbyterians and the Methodists of New York,—the Calvinists and the Arminians—have heartily joined together in denouncing the Wisconsin decision and demanding religious instruction in the public schools. Yet if the State should decide to establish religious instruction in the public schools and should leave it to these two denominations to decide just what form of religion should be taught there, and to what degree, it would be difficult to find any two denominations in all the land between which there would be a wider divergence of view, or a more bitter contention.

THE New York *Herald,* not long since, secured an interview with the Pope, in which that dignitary expressed great love for America and the Americans. He expressed great anxiety over the “discontent, disorder, hatred, and profound unhappiness” that is seen in the present condition of society; and says he has studied how to bring about a change, and that, while he lives, he will labor to relieve the world of this terrible confusion. These good professions of the Pope had the effect of greatly pleasing the *Christian Union,* and it gives vent to its delight in these words:—

> We cordially greet the Pope as an honored leader of a great international community in the work of industrial and social reform, no less than as a witness of the first importance to the fact that such a reform is the imperative need of our time.

Yes, we are perfectly satisfied that in the settling of this social confusion, the Pope will have much to do, and with the result that when it is settled, it will be to the advantage of the Papacy, and with the Pope as the head over all and supreme arbiter for the world.

THE Telluride *Republican* should experience no difficulty in deciding what the AMERICAN SENTINEL means. That journal cuts too clean to be misunderstood. It objects to placing God on a level with vile man, and *The Graphic *takes the same high ground. The religion that Jesus of Nazareth taught, first; the statutes of the State next. Both separate and distinct.—*Colorado Graphic. *[153]
