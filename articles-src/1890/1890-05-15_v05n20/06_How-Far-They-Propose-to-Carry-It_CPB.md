A REGULAR contributor to the *Christian Statesman,* Rev. N. R. Johnston, of Oakland, California, has an article in that paper, of April 10 and 17, entitled, "Christ's Headship over the Nations," which is worthy of notice, for the reason that he is a representative National Reformer, and it is fair to presume that his views are entirely in harmony with those of his brethren, since they are published without dissent in the official organ of the National Reform Association. Referring to the evils which prevail in our land, Mr. Johnston says:—

> The antidote to these abounding evils and to whatever tends to ruin us as a Nation is to be found in two things:—

> 1. The general prevalence of pure religion and consequent pure Christian morals. To bring about this desirable end is, under God, the work of the Church of Christ.
> 2. The voluntary submission of the Nation and Government to Christ Jesus as Lord of nations; or voluntary obedience to King Jesus.

With the first of these "two things" no Christian can find one word of fault. It is most emphatically true. The only antidote for evil, in the sense of sin, or wickednesses to be found in Christianity; but Christianity can operate upon a nation only through individuals. It can elevate a nation morally only by reforming and elevating individuals; and to do this "is, under God, the work of the Church," but the Church bears no message to nations; the gospel message is to be preached *in* all nations, but *to* individuals, and only individuals can hear, believe, and obey it, and be reformed and saved by it.

The second of Mr. Johnston's "two things" is the central thought of National Reform. Undoubtedly those who urge it suppose that they do it for the honor of Christ, and for the good of the Nation. But its danger is equalled only by its subtlety. Such submission would be only a mockery unless at least a majority of the Nation were indeed Christians, and even then it would be a real submission only on the part of those who were Christians; and after it was made the Nation would be no more Christian, in the proper sense of the word, than it was before; that is, it would be Christian only so far as those who composed it were Christian. Indeed while there might be a nation of Christians, there can be no such thing as a Christian nation. To make such a submission more than an empty compliment, a mere profession meaning nothing, force would have to be given to it by making the law of Christ, the divine law as revealed in the word of God, the supreme law of the land. But to do that would be to establish a theocracy; not indeed a true theocracy in which God himself would be the ruler, but a man-made theocracy in which men would rule in the name of God. But in such a theocracy as that the supreme law would be not the law of God in fact, but such a version of that law as those in power might from time to time see fit to impose upon those under their rule. That theocracy would not be one divinely established, and administered by inspired men, as was the theocracy under Moses and Joshua, but it would be a theocracy established by men and administered, not only by uninspired men, but too often by evil and designing men. This would be in effect to put men in the place of God and to cause men to look to their fellows instead of to God to know their duty toward God. It is by this very principle that the Pope rules; in fact the principle of the Papacy, and of National Reform is the same. The only difference is that the Papacy exalts the Pope, while National Reform would exalt some other man or men in exactly the same way and with the same result; namely, that of placing men in the place of God and causing them to stand in the relation of God to their fellows so far as moral government is concerned.

The moral law, the law of God, binds the consciences of men. It follows, therefore, that to make men the administrators of the divine law is to give them power over the consciences of their fellow-men. The unavoidable conclusion is that National Reform seeks to endow human Governments with the sovereignty of conscience, a sovereignty which, according to the gospel, belongs only to God. But it may be said, as it has been said before, that National Reform would make the divine law as revealed in the Scriptures, the law of the land no farther than to make it the model for human legislation, and that only so far as it might be applicable to civil government. But how far would it be held to be applicable? This question is one the Government would have to decide, and it would be decided not by any fixed and infallible rule, not by divine wisdom and direction, but by men certain to err even as men have erred before in deciding similar questions. It would just as certainly make men judges of the divine law as it would to declare the whole law of God the supreme rule in civil affairs.

We are not, however, left to surmises in this matter. In the article in the [156] *Christian Statesman* before referred to, Mr. Johnston tells just how far they would consider the law of God as applicable to civil government. He says:—

> All civil governments and all officers should take the Bible as the higher law and as the rule of action. Indeed, this holy law is just as good a rule of action in the State, as in the Church, or in personal relations. Accordingly the whole moral law as summed up in the ten commandments, and the whole moral Mosaic penal code, would be the rule of action in Congress, in State Legislatures and in the courts of justice. Kidnapping, man-stealing, blasphemy and adultery, as well as murder would be punished by severe penalties. Not the ever- changing will of the people, but the unchangeable law of the Most High would be of supreme authority. As this would be right, can we doubt that good would result?

The practical results of such a system of government Mr. Johnston describes as follows:—

> It would secure the administration of a rightly constituted government by righteous legislators, judges, and executors. It would make only righteous men, men of Christian morality—eligible to office. It would keep out of office all ungodly and wicked men. Aspirants for office, for power, for honor, or for spoils—unbelieving and immoral men, asking the dear people to make them legislators, or congressmen, or judges, or governors, would be left at home.

Again he says:—

> It would tend powerfully to the suppression of existing evil—of all abounding wickedness. Public idol worship, profanity, blasphemy, Sabbath desecration, disregard of parental authority, oppression of the poor, and of the millions once enslaved, shameful wrongs done to women, the licensed liquor traffic, intemperance, legalized prostitution, infamous divorce systems, polygamy, bloodshed, adultery,—these and similar evils would be punished as the divine law requires.

These extracts which are in no way modified by anything else in Mr. Johnston's article, show that the National Reform idea is not simply to have Christian principles govern the Nation through the influence which Christianity ought to have upon the individuals that compose the Nation, but by making not only the ten commandments but also "the whole moral Mosaic penal code" the law of the Nation. And this he thinks would keep wicked men out of office. If it did, it would do better than it did anciently. The righteous rulers of the whole nation of Israel from Saul to Zedekiah were the exception, and wicked kings the rule. The National Reform scheme of government would tend rather to make hypocrites than to secure honesty in the administration of government.

It is a wonder that any man who has a sincere regard for good morals, as a personal acquaintance with Mr. Johnston warrants us in believing that he has, would for a moment think it wise to make a profession of religion a qualification for civil office. Under such a system every politician would of necessity be a member of the Church, and corrupt men would rule the Church as they now rule political parties; and while the Church would be so much worse, the Government would be no better. It is a sad fact that defaulters and embezzlers are about as common—not indeed among Christians, but among those who profess to be Christians—as among those who make no profession. The reason for this is that many join the Church through some improper motive, in order to gain some social or business advantage, and not having the root of the matter in them, when temptation comes, they fall. What assurance then could there possibly be that Christians would be any more honest under the proposed National Reform *regime* than they are now, or than they have been under similar circumstances in other countries? There could be no such assurance; on the contrary, a knowledge of human nature, and the history of the past lead us to believe that instead of purifying the State, National Reform would hopelessly corrupt both the State, and the Church.

The nature of the penalties which, according to their own representation of the matter, would be inflicted under the proposed National Reform system will be examined in another article.
