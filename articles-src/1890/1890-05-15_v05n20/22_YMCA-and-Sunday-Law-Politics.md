SOME time ago the SENTINEL expressed its gratification that the Young Men's Christian Association had kept itself clear of all the religio-political movements that have arisen. We are now compelled to retract that statement, at least so far as the Young Men's Christian Association of California is concerned. It seems that the leader of the State Sunday-Law Association there, is a member of the Young Men's Christian Association, and in his work he assumes to wield the political power of that Association in favor of candidates for the Legislature who will pledge themselves in favor of a Sunday law.

From the *Republican* of Fresno City, California, April 22, 1890, we clip the following editorial note which explains the situation, and which is important upon more than this particular point of the Sunday-law issue:—

> When Dr. Edward Thompson outlined the policy of the Young Men's Christian Association in politics, on Sunday evening in his lecture on the "Necessity of a Sunday Law," he gave the Association a responsibility which will cause it considerable trouble, accepting the lecturer's statement as correct. In regard to the coming political contest in this State the speaker said that while the Association was not a political one in any sense, still they proposed to make their influence felt, by waiting until after legislative candidates were nominated, then they would go to the dominant party and ask its candidate to pledge himself to vote for a Sunday law. In case he would do so they would vote for him, but should he refuse, the energies of voting members of the Young Men's Christian Association would be United to encompass his defeat. The public at large would like to know if the speaker was authorized to reflect the sentiment of the Fresno branch of the Association.
