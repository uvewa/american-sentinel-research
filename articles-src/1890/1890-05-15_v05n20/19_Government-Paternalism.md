THE New York *World* lately secured a unique kind of an interview with United States Senator Ingalls, by which it secured the Senator's views on a goodly number of interesting questions. The Senator's statement on one point touches a matter to which we have called attention in these columns considerably of late; that is, the drift toward paternalism in Government. He said:—

> It begins to appear as if individuals had no rights or no private business which the Government was bound to respect. The injustice of society and the inequality of conditions have given an enormous impulse to the idea of nationalism, the control of all economic agencies by the direct interposition of the Government, This is the logical reaction from individualism, on which our system was fonded. The hope that political equality would result in the destruction of poverty and in social fraternity lias not been realized; There are larger private fortunés, there is greater political power in fewer hands; in other words, there is more tyrany in the Republic than in a monarchy. The strongest succeeds more rapidly and more readily here because liberty being common to all, there are no restraints and limitations to overcome. The demand now is, therefore, not that all shall be free, but that all shall be restrained from the full exercise of their faculties and from the enjoyment of their acquisitions.
