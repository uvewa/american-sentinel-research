SINCE the confessed "Waterloo" that the National Sunday-law issue met at Washington upon the Breckinridge Sunday Bill, there has been considerable query as to what turn next would be taken by the managers of that movement. It now begins to appear, and it is that they are putting forth their efforts to so shape elections as to get into legislative halls men who will be but tools in their hands for the accomplishment of their purposes. Mr. Crafts has gone to California; Mrs. Bateham was already there; and they are driving a strong campaign, by which they hope to secure in the election next fall, a Legislature that will give them a Sunday law there. The leading State worker there, Rev. Edward Thompson, says, that although the Association is not a political one, still they propose "to make their influence felt by waiting until after legislative candidates are nominated, then go to the dominant party and ask its candidate to pledge himself to vote for a Sunday law. In case he will do so, they will vote for him, but should he refuse, the energies of the voting members of the Association will be united to compass his defeat." And in this he included the members of the Young Men's Christian Association. In Chicago also they are strongly pushing the political organization of the Sunday forces. By the time the next Congressional election comes around, they will no doubt make a national campaign on this issue. Now, therefore, is the time to work as never before with and amongst the people, in order that there also these religio-political tinkers may meet another "Waterloo."
