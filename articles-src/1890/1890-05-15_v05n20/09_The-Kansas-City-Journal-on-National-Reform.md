UNDER the title of "God in the Constitution," the Kansas City *Journal,* of January 22, has the following which is worth reading and remembering:—

This is a subject that is discussed from various standpoints, but mainly from theologie and anti-theologic premises, which excite all the antagonisms and animosities of the religious conflicts of past times. We are at once taken back to the times and spirit of the Middle Ages, and Hallam's summary of that epoch furnishes the coloring of one side or the other, more than the ideas of Paine, Franklin, Jefferson, and the men who kept our American civil ideals free from this master element of discord among the people of the earth.

It is a mistaken issue. It is not whether there is a God, or whether there is not. It is not a question of a Creator or of a creative power—and above all it is not a question between theism and atheism. But it is a question of the introduction into our organic law of a problem that does not apply to the practical affairs of life, but is merely the opinion of this or that man or organization of men as to the conditions of a life after this one—of a question that no one mind can think or settle for another, any more than it can sense the palate of another. It is not a practical question at all—at best it is a hypothetical one and can never be settled, because no precedent can be availed of to know.

For example, we can tell whether or no universal suffrage works to the betterment or detriment of society, but we cannot feel or sense how a belief in one God or three Gods, or three in one, affects the tariff or the land question. They do not settle these, one way or the other, but to vote on them does. The form in which so-called religion has entered into these questions may well be illustrated in the formula so familiar to everyone: "Resolved that the earth belongs to the Lord for the use of his saints. Resolved, that we are the saints." This has been and is to-day the practical application and working of "God in the Constitution" of every form of government on earth, where religion has been recognized as a thing of the State.

It goes without saying, in this last decade of the nineteenth century, that every man, and woman and child is a member of society with equal natural rights. These natural rights are easily and clearly defined—the right to life, the right to liberty and the right to pursue happiness, each for himself. Now, the conditions of happiness cover all the rest. Holding property and its protection is a tangible thing in society, and these cover all the material things conducive to happiness in this world—all else is embraced under what we call liberty—the action of the mind—of the real man. The moment you use material power to control or coerce this freedom of mind that moment you introduce tyranny, discord and strife—because you have interfered with the most important right of humanity.

It is not the recognition of God that is involved—for no mature, sane mind, whether savage or civilized, ever denied the existence of the creative power or the wisdom that is expressed through worlds. And it is about time the intelligent world resented the canting superiority assumed by ignorance and craft—that there are such things as "infidels" and "atheists" in the world. The worst form of infidelity or atheism the world has ever known is that which denies to man the right to his God-given freedom to think and to be what his best thought can make him. It is time that the assumption of any authority to say what "sin" is, should be branded with what it is—infidelity to God and man. The free, the real worshipers of God—those who do as Jesus did—worship the Creator by doing good to his created, should assert themselves and no longer beg the question from anybody.

The ecclesiastical world has so long forced man into a false position that it has become almost hereditary with us to concede them some sort of authority in such matters. There is no authority in this world older or superior to the people themselves—and the people derive authority of the individual himself. Society is only the delegated authority of the individual. Self-preservation is the first law of nature. To make this effective, men agree to exercise this law collectively. This is what we call government—and it is all there is. How can we worship God otherwise than in this recognition of natural justice—for it is all we are capable of expressing in action. So the highest worship of God is the highest development of good in man. Now those who deny this are the infidels, those who seek to disturb or overthrow that condition, the atheists. This is all of the teachings of Jesus, and it is about time those who agree with that teaching and assert it as a foundation of human government should assert their true position, and let those who have transformed them into a set of metaphysical doctrines and opinions understand that the matter in question is understood. This assumption by traditional ignorance and tyranny must be done away with, and given to understand that the intelligent portion of mankind have got to know their true position—that it is simply a usurped authority, teaching in the name of Jesus, not only what he did not teach, but perverting his whole scheme of teaching. The nearest formula, as to human conduct, to the teachings of Jesus is found in the Declaration of Independence; and the Constitution of the United States is the embodiment, as near as may be, of those principles in the management of organized society. [158]

This is the true God in the Constitution—the freedom of the individual. Now, how are we going to improve upon it by putting "God" into this instrument? "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these, ye have done it unto me." To the least of men the Constitution has done it—and that is all the God that can be put in it. It is full of God now, and to put any one man's God in it takes out of it the God of all men. That states the question about as clearly as need be. The bloody record of religious persecutions and wars is but the history of attempts to put the God of somebody into the constitution of society to the exclusion of the God of everybody. The conception itself is narrow, it is born of ignorance, and the attempt is but a form of intolerance.
