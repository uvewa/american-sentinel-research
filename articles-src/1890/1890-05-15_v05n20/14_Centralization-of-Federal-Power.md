HON. WILLIAM C. OATES, of Alabama, said, in the House of Representatives, on April 16, while speaking upon the bill "to define and regulate the jurisdiction of the Courts of the United States: "—

> There is one alarming feature in the tendency of the times, in the tendency of Congress, and in the tendency of our Federal judiciary, and that is, towards the centralization of Federal power.

> Why, Mr. Speaker, let any man look at the number of bills that are brought before Congress at every session, that are properly within the jurisdiction which Congress has assumed, and see how utterly impossible it is for Congress, even if it sat from year's end to year's end, to give consideration to even one third of them, and let him in all candor say whither we are tending. How are you going to administer the affairs of your Government in its present form, if this tendency to the enlargement of its jurisdiction is to go on? It behooves every lover of this country to cut down Federal jurisdiction instead of enlarging it, if he would preserve and perpetuate our Government and its blessings for the benefit of posterity.

And yet it is proposed by Senator Blair, in his Educational Bill, that, in consideration of $77,000,000 in hand paid, the States should surrender their public-school systems to the virtual censorship of the general Government, and constitute the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Education, a governmental educational Bureau for the oversight of school interests of the United States. Then, in the educational amendment to the Constitution, offered by the same Senator, it is expressly indicated what shall be the character of the public schools which each State shall establish, and what shall be taught therein, with a provision that Congress may enforce its requirements by legislation, when necessary. More than this, in the Sunday-rest Bill, Congress has been asked to take paternal charge of the "Sunday observance" of all persons under its exclusive jurisdiction, m its mail and military service, in inter- State commerce, on the high seas, and throughout the world.
