IN speaking of the last days of the Roman Republic, Tacitus remarks that "laws were not made for the public only; but for particular men,"—the idea being that the public good was not the first thought, but that political advantage took precedence, and that those who had the making of the laws would play into the hands of particular men, or classes of men, in order to secure their support: and that, on the other hand, particular men or classes looked only to their own interests, to their own advantage, and not to the public good.

To any one who has watched the course of legislation in the United States for the last few years, it will not be difficult to detect the growth of a condition of things which is becoming more and more precisely parallel with that to which Tacitus refers. It is becoming more and more a serious fact that in our Legislatures, laws are not made for the public only, but for particular men.
