DURANGO, Colorado, has a Sunday law entitled, "An Ordinance Requiring the Observance of the Sabbath." But of course it is a mere "police regulation," a "sanitary measure," to secure to the "tired son of toil a day of rest." It must be so for with the exception of the title it is almost identical with numerous State and municipal acts which we are assured are purely civil.
