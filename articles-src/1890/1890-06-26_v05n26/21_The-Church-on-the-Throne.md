"MORAL forces," said Mrs. Mary T. Lathrap at the recent Temperance Congress in this city, "are the imperial forces, and the nation is safe only when its moral forces are on the throne. I believe that in some of our great cities, and in some eastern commonwealths, we are reaching a moral deadlock, when the moral forces are beaten down, and beaten back by the forces of evil around them. Now I believe that the Church is the party, and ought to be the organized expression of moral forces in government just as I believe that the saloon is the organized form of the devil's kingdom on earth."

Let us examine this a little. "The moral forces are the imperial forces."

"The nation is safe only when its moral forces are on the throne."

"The Church is the organized expression of moral forces in government."

The inevitable conclusion is that the Church should be upon the throne. And yet, in common with other National Reformers, Mrs. Lathrap would no doubt indignantly deny any desire to unite Church and State in this country or to subject the State to the Church.
