IN commenting upon Senator Stanford's proposition to create a Land Loan Bureau in the Treasury Department, by means of which the Government shall loan money on unincumbered real estate, at a low rate of interest, for a long term of years, the *Christian Union* remarks that it is a much longer step toward Nationalism than it appears to be on its surface, and then pertinently says: "In view of these schemes for making the Government a silent partner in all sorts of industries, we think the time is ripe for some instruction, in popular literature and lectures, on the true functions of government." We think so too: paternalism, or Nationalism, which is only another name for the same thing, will yet be the ruin of this country.
