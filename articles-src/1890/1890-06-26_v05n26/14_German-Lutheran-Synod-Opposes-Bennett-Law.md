AN Iowa paper, of June 14, says:—

> The German Lutheran Synod, in session at Dubuque this week, has 300 ministers, 450 congregations, and 50,000 communicants, and is spread over fourteen States. Delegates were present from Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Ohio, Missouri, Michigan, and Washington. The Convention was opened by the President, the Rev. Prof. G. Grosswell, D. D., of Waverly, Iowa. Reports were read denouncing the Bennett Law. The Synod resolved to introduce Barnes' school text-books of the American Book Company in the parochial schools.

And this is the people who, we are told, have to be forced by law to educate their children in English. [207-208]
