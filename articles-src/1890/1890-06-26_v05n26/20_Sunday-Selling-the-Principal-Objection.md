A READER has sent us a report of the Gloucester County (N. J.) Temperance Alliance clipped from the *Gloucester Constitution,* which is of interest because of one bit of information which it contains. Referring to an effort which had been made in the name of the Alliance to prevent the issuance of a liquor license to Lincoln Park Company, the chairman of the committee having the matter in charge said:—

> In conversation with the judges your chairman told them *our principal objection to Lincoln Park was the fear of Sunday selling and the consequent disgrace to our county*.

Some further history of the case then follows, and the report concludes thus:—

> Our attorney stated plainly our objections. Then Mr. Mc Gowen, the President [of the Park company] and Mr. Patterson, the applicant, personally stated that no liquor would be sold on Sunday; that all the laws would be obeyed. . . . Upon receiving these assurances, on the advice of counsel, your chairman consented to withdraw the remonstrance. Our counsel made the announcement to the court, the judges nodded their approval, and in a few minutes publicly announced that the license to keep an inn and tavern at Lincoln Park was granted.

This shows the drift of much of the so-called temperance sentiment, and is right in line with something which appeared some months since in the *California Prohibitionist:* a correspondent of that paper remarked that if the saloons would only close on Sunday, he thought it was about all that could be reasonably asked of them.
