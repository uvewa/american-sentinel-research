THE first form of government given to man, was committed to him by the Author of his existence, and was of a paternal nature. Under this, each head of a tribe became the absolute ruler of his family interests. He not only interested himself in the temporal welfare of his subjects, but was considered by them, their spiritual leader as well. This continued to be the criterion in the patriarchal age, but, as family circles enlarged, and connecting ties became more slender, individual interests became more and more antagonized, until it was necessary to institute another form of government, which would provide for the exigencies arising from the ever multiplying and divergent interests, and yet not encroaching upon purely personal rights enjoyed under the previously existing polity.

One of the God-given rights of every man, is to exercise parental authority in his family. It has been from the first, and is still, the privilege of parents to decide what rules shall govern in their respective households, without regard to how others govern in their families. It is also their privilege to instill just such principles, and to teach just such behavior toward themselves and all others, as they may think proper and right. This authority has the sanction of both the Old and New Testaments in the following expressions: "Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it" (Prov. 22:6,); and, "Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath, but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord." Eph. 6:4.

By these injunctions parents are alone made responsible for the moral well-being of their children, consequently, are given absolute control of their moral training. The civil government has no such credentials, and therefore has not the least right to interfere with the direction of any household, unless, perchance, its inmates are jeopardized in life or limb, by the despotic sway of unnatural parents. In this case, the civil power may step in, and protect the child from physical injury.

The Church, like the family, is paternal or instructive in its government. It, too, decides its own tenets of faith, and rules of discipline. The Church holds a commission from Heaven to preach the gospel, and administer the ordinances thereof. By virtue of that commission, it rightfully extends its occupation to become the guardian of family morals. But while the Church is thus permitted to give religious instruction to as many families as wish it, there are certain limits, beyond which it has no right to go. The Church may counsel parents how to train their children for heaven, but it has no commission to usurp authority over the children, because that has been reserved to parents alone.

Civil government is essentially different from that of both the Church and the family, in that its functions are wholly of a civil nature. In other words, it is that form of government which guards the social privileges, and prescribes the civil duties of all under its jurisdiction, without regard to their religious beliefs. Civil government has to do with the people, only as citizens, without regard to Christianity. The Church, on the other hand, deals with its members simply as Christians, without authority to inflict civil penalties. The State formulates civil law for all alike, within its precincts, whether Christian or unbeliever. The Church has but spiritual authority, and that only over those who profess faith in the tenets of the Church, and have formally connected themselves with it.

But the test of citizenship is not based on any religious creed. So long as one duly regards the rights of others, as human beings, and readily meets his part of the obligations which rest alike on all; [205] so long as he promptly discharges all the demands of the government upon him, the State must recognize him as a good citizen, even though he may be an atheist. The State, as such, can know no difference between a Christian and an unbeliever. This must necessarily be so, from the fact that Christianity relates wholly to another world, to things spiritual and eternal, while civil governments have to do entirely with the affairs of this world—with the temporal only.

A State cannot properly enter the realm of religion, to direct its methods, or restrain its operations when properly conducted, that is, so long as it does not trespass upon the domain of the civil, for the reason that true religion is from a higher source than human authority, and its subjects are responsible to a higher than an earthly tribunal. Christianity is founded on the unchangeable word of Jehovah, while earthly governments are ever being modified to meet the rapidly changing conditions of society. These varying phases are produced by majorities, which are often created through political cabal or personal magnetism. To subject religion to the control of such influences, is to delegate it to the domain of human strife, and the corruptions of party power.

Again, religion being a matter between the individual soul and its God, no one person has a right to make his conscience the rule by which to guide another, in things spiritual. The same principles obtain, in relation to majorities. The greater part of a community may be agreed concerning some matter of conscience; but, if only one among them holds a different opinion, his rights of conscience are just as sacred as those of all the others, and should be respected. Then, for the majority of a community to dominate the minority in matters of conscience, is to assume infallibility in spiritual affairs; and so, to make the consciences of the larger part, the rule of conscience for all others. That would be unjust; for while it would permit the majority to exercise spiritual discretion, it would forbid that privilege to all who happened to be in the minority. Moreover, such a state of things would subject the minority to others who would make their religious creeds, regulate their mode of worship, and tax them for the support of a religion which the majority might think to be true, but which they themselves may believe to be false.

But when a religious majority are engaged in such work, they are not exercising their own rights of conscience, but are trampling on the rights of others, instead. It is safe to say that any Christian would come to this conclusion if the proper test were brought to bear in his case. Suppose, for instance, that in the turn of human affairs, a pagan majority should prevail in a country composed largely of Christians, and should compel all Christians to support paganism: Would Christians who then happened to be in the minority, consider themselves justly treated, when compelled to support a religion in which they had no faith? Certainly not. But would it be any less wrong for a majority of Christians to compel a person dissenting from the faith of Christianity, to support that religion?

This is doubtless putting the question in a form in which some have not before considered it. But is it not reasonable to believe that the Golden Rule, "Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so unto them," has as forcible application in a matter of this kind as in any other? The rights of conscience are individual, and cannot be settled by arraying the larger number against the smaller. Therefore, whatever faith a man's conscience may lead him to adopt, even though he may stand alone in the community, if that conscience is exercised peaceably, and not against the rights of another person, its rights should be recognized and as fully protected, as those of all the others.J. O. CORLISS.
