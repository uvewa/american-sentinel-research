# God in Government

A GREAT deal of dignified nonsense has been written on the recognition of God in government, union of religion and the State, and kindred subjects, and we expect much more. Some think it absolutely necessary that religion be connected with the State, and God recognized by the Government, and that no harm will follow in the way of intolerance or persecution, as some anticipate. An article of this kind has appeared in the *Arena* for May, over the signature of Canon W. H. Freemantle. The writer anticipates no trouble from the recognition of God in government, because “this Christianity [of the Bible] can never beget a church which is the foe of progress.”

He further says, in speaking of what is vital in Christianity: “In this I trust the two countries are agreed. I see in both [189] an increasing desire to legislate for the moral good of the people, and I cannot doubt that in the sphere of practical life the two organisms—a church thoroughly nationalized and a nation thoroughly Christianized—will blend together to be the first-fruits of the new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.”

Now all this sounds very well, but there are some things worthy of consideration in this connection. 1. The Christianity of to-day is no more the Christianity of the Bible, than was the Christianity of the third and fourth century. Yet out of those centuries came the worst system of iniquity which ever cursed the world. Yet this system recognized God in the Government, and was used for the conservation of what was then considered vital to Christianity. Was the union of religion and the State during the Dark Ages a *friend* to progress? 2. Pure Christianity, that of the Bible, will never form a union with the world, nor with worldly powers. 3. “A church thoroughly nationalized” is a spiritual harlot according to the word of God; and a “nation thoroughly Christianized,” as far as the egis of law can make it so, is but a repetition of the Dark Ages. A true Christian nation will be seen only when Christ destroys the national governments of earth and reigns in glory over a people redeemed by grace, not law.—*Signs of the Times.*
