A JUDGE in Pennsylvania, lately rendered a decision on "works of necessity and mercy" on Sunday, in which he declared that Sunday could not be surrendered to the fierce rivalry to get gain, and that "it has come down to us with the most solemn sanctions, both of God and man, and if we do not appreciate it as we ought, we are, at least, bound to preserve it."

Upon which, the *Pearl of Days* remarks:—

> Above all else, the supreme will of God as to what the Sabbath day was given to man for should enable us to decide questions of supposed necessity.

Exactly! That is the real reason in all the arguments for Sunday laws that are made, and it shows the hollow pretenses to virtue in the arguments of those who plead for the "civil" Sunday. [209]
