# AHow Do They Use It?

THE lessening of the hours of labor may seem to be a very good thing for mechanics, but it is not impossible that in the long run it may be found to work against their interests. A great many persons who are not mechanics, but toil as arduously as any mechanics ever do or did, do not find that they can make a fair living unless they work more than eight hours a day. If the whole wide world can get along upon eight hours a day for toil, and is ready to devote the rest of its time to proper rest and recreation, and to such pursuits as will help to relieve those who engage in them, we wish the eight-hour rule might be established the world over. But the question arises, whether, apart from possible financial difficulties, the reduction of the hours of labor and consequent increase of hours of idleness may not prove in a moral point of view more hurtful than helpful to the laboring classes? Do they use well such leisure as they now have? Or do they use it in a way that suggests that increase of leisure would prove only a curse, and not a blessing?—*New York Observer.*

A RELIGIOUS paper of Oakland, California, has the following item which contains a thought worth repeating. It says:—

> There is published in Santa Cruz, California, a monthly journal called the *Buddhist Ray,* which boasts of being the first paper of its kind published in a Christian city. It is being circulated in Japan. What is a *Christian* city? And if a city were Christian, would it publish a Buddhist journal? The doctrine of Christ is, “Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.” The paper has naught of which to boast. Christ would not recognize Santa Cruz as his, any more than he would Yeddo, Oakland, London, or any other city.

THE defeat of what is known as the Bennett law, on a direct issue in Milwaukee, shows the danger of carrying unnecessary proscription into the public schools.—*Christian at Work*. [191-192]

SOME men are bound to get to the front no matter what it costs; notoriety they will have in one way or another, as is just now strikingly exemplified in the case of Senator Blair, whose picture and name figure prominently in a patent medicine advertisement in several papers. In years to come when it shall be asked, Who was H. W. Blair? the answer will be, He is the man who was cured by Dr. Blank’s Wild Cherry and Sarsaparilla Troches.

AMONG the many petitions for a national Sunday law presented to Congress during the present session, is one from “one hundred and two citizens of Massachusetts, praying for the better observance of the Sabbath.” The query naturally arises, If these petitioners really desire better Sabbath observance why do they not observe it better? There is no law in this country against any man’s observing any day just as well as he wishes to. It would be just as appropriate to petition Congress for better attendance at church, or for more regularity in family worship, or for less formality in giving thanks when sitting down to dinner. There is really no difference between petitions to Congress asking for a national Sunday law, and petitions “praying for the better observance of the Sabbath;” the latter, however, show more plainly the wish of the petitioners, namely, the legal enforcement of a religious institution.

THE Boston Committee of One Hundred, taking their cue from the United States Supreme Court decision upon the Mormon test oath, are now urging that the Roman Catholics shall be disfranchised. They declare:—

> We do not hesitate to say, as a measure for the Nation’s self-preservation, that no man who confesses allegiance to the Pontiff should be allowed to participate, as a citizen, in either holding office, or casting a ballot. The United States Supreme Court has decided that the law of one of our States disfranchising Mormons is constitutional, on the theory that the man who takes the oath the Mormons were required to take cannot be a good citizen. Why should not this principle be applied to those who confess allegiance to the Papal hierarchy? No ballot for the man who takes his politics from the Vatican.

The Committee of One Hundred are not alone in this; there are several papers in different parts of the country that advocate the same measure, and for the same reason. Others advocate the same measure for other reasons. But whether it be this reason or others, the truth is that those who advocate such a proceeding, hold a despotic theory and proceed upon a despotic principle. And if they had the power to execute their wish, the despotism that would thereby be established, would be no less cruel than that which they assert characterizes that which they wish to abolish. That Committee of One Hundred should be annihilated.

Miss MARY F. LATHROP, of the Non- Partisan Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, is now on a visit to the Pacific Coast, in the interest of Christian temperance. She met a rather hot reception from some of the partisans of the partisan Woman’s Christian Temperance Union. In an address in the First Congregational Church, Oakland, Sunday evening, May 25, she referred to this, and read a letter which she had received from a preacher, before she started for the Coast. In the letter the preacher said to her:—

> Don’t you dare to come to California, you scarlet woman of Babylon, you hand-painted Jezebel!

When she had read this, Miss Lathrop lowered her voice and quietly remarked:—

You laugh, my friends, but it is no laughing matter. If connection with political parties inculcates such feelings as this, where Christian love, forbearance and peace and good will should exist, is n’t it high time we got away from politics?

So say we. All honor to the womanly women, who have cut loose from a leadership that is characterized by mannishness in women, and womanishness in men.

SOME of our exchanges are still repeating the story that the Nun of Kenmare had received subscriptions for a forthcoming book and then “disappeared,” leaving said subscribers with neither their money nor the book. There never was a particle of truth in the story. There was no disappearance of the Nun. She was filling a lecture engagement in Baltimore, in midwinter, when she took a severe cold, which settled in her throat, affecting it so that she was compelled to break off her engagement, and by the positive direction of physicans go to Florida for her health. But at no time did she disappear, for her publishers as well as her friends knew all the time where she was. Yet her enemies seized upon this circumstance, and, being virtually in control of the press of the country, made it tell for all they could against her. Besides this, when she found that her book would be delayed, she wrote personally from Florida to each subscriber, offering to return the money if he did not want to wait longer than was at first expected for the book. Her enemies however, knowing well that a sensational story stands a much better chance of wide circulation through the daily press than the truth can possibly secure, made the fullest use of their opportunity.

We have the honor to be personally acquainted with the Nun of Kenmare—Miss M. F. Cusack;—we have had an hour’s conversation with her, within a week before this writing; and we know that there never was a particle of truth in the story of her disappearance. It was wholly an invention, and the wish that it might be so was the mother of the invention. She is working diligently at the book referred to—“Why I Left the Church of Rome” —and hopes to have it in the press soon. If all the people knew what steady persecutions follow her, and what repeated difficulties meet her, so far from wondering why the book is delayed, they would the rather wonder at the splendid courage that sustains her in undertaking to print the book at all, and in carrying on the noble fight that she is making. From our acquaintance with this lady, we believe her to be a genuine Christian woman, and well worthy of the sympathy and support of everybody who loves Christianity or admires courage.

THE *Christian Statesman* of April 24, copies from the illustrated *Christian Weekly, *an article by the Rev. Robert F. Sample, D. D., in which he says that “patriotism is a Christian virtue.” We have read the New Testament through several times, and we never yet discovered this amongst the Christian virtues. One list of these virtues is as follows: “The fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.” Another list gives these: “Faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness, charity.” Patriotism is not amongst these, nor is it anywhere mentioned in the New Testament amongst the Christian virtues. How Mr. Sample found it out therefore, when it is not written, we should like to know. Will Mr. Sample give his authority? or, will the *Christian Statesman* give the authority for the statement?
