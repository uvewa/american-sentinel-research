# Why He Sails Under Cover.

M. A. GAULT, in *Christian Nation, *April 30, says:—

> Brother Crafts is now making a tour of the West, but does not announce his meetings definitely, I presume in order that these organizers of the opposition may not get on his track.

Yes; that is what we presumed some time ago. But why does he not wish these opponents to get on his track? Is he fearful of the results of an open conflict when overtaken by them? or doesn’t he want such large crowds, anyway? Evidently he is not advocating doctrines which admit of such profound reasoning and unanswerable arguments that those who have attacked him once dare not ask him any questions after that. On the contrary, he seems anxious to avoid having to answer the questions a second time. But a lack of definiteness in making appointments may not only keep the opposition off his track, but his friends and abettors also. To such inconvenience is error put when pursued by truth. Why does not Mr. Crafts stand his ground?— *W. A. Colcord.*
