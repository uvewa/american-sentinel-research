JUNE 11 and 12, there was held in this city a Temperance Congress representing every shade of temperance sentiment in the country, the only condition required of delegates, being opposition to the saloon. The Congress was large and enthusiastic, and while it adopted no platform and passed no resolutions, there was no room to doubt that an overwhelming majority present were third party Prohibitionists. The readers of THE SENTINEL need not be told that it is opposed to the liquor traffic, yet we could not help feeling that there was a spirit manifested in the Congress which bodes no good to the country; it was the spirit of intolerance, and of government by clamor. Speaking of the Supreme Court decision in the original package cases, one speaker said that if the Constitution upheld the liquor traffic, he was in favor of spitting on the Constitution and stepping on it. If the Constitution as it is upholds the liquor traffic, we say let us respect it and abide by it until such time as public sentiment shall be educated up to the point of amending the Constitution. The country can get along very well without the patriotism that proposes to spit on the Constitution.
