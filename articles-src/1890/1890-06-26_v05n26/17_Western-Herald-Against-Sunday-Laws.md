THE *Western Herald* published at Burlington, Iowa, comes to us filled with hard arguments against Sunday laws and kindred religious legislation. Referring to the efforts of the Sunday-law advocates the *Herald* says: "It has taken centuries to evolve separation of Church and State, and now we are asked to surrender our vantage ground, and relapse once more into the darkness of the medieval ages."
