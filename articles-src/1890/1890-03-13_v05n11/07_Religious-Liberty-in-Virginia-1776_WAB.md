# Religious Liberty in Virginia, 1776.

WHEN the American colonies were just on the verge of war, conventions of the leading statesmen were held in every colony. The minds of all were agitated, and it was with intense interest that the early Americans watched for the results of the proceedings of the representatives that they had sent to these conventions at the various capitals.

Among these colonies, one of the foremost in agitating absolute civil and religious liberty, one of the foremost in the production of great statesmen, and one of the foremost in working for all that was for the well-being of America, was the Colony of Virginia. It was in her halls that the inimitable eloquence of Patrick Henry found utterance; it was in her legislative assemblies that Monroe and Madison gave vent to their ideas on the formation of a Government for the people; it was in this grand old Colony that Jefferson, who drafted the immortal Decaration of Independence, first gave evidence of his statesmanship; and it was Virginia that gave birth to Washington, the father of his country. Among such minds as these liberty of conscience received an impetus, which for more than a century, its opponents have tried to counteract.

In the great Convention of Virginia, in May, June, and July, 1776, it was—

> *Resolved unanimously,* That a committee be appointed to prepare a Declaration of Rights, and such a plan of Government as will be most likely to maintain peace and order in this Colony, and secure substantial and equal liberty to the people.

The committee was appointed. It drafted a declaration of rights which, after being amended, was read a third time and passed, without a single dissenting voice. The title and first and last paragraphs read as follows:—

> A *Declaration of Rights, made by the representatives of the good people of Virginia, assembled in full and free convention; which rights do pertain to them and their posterity, as the basis and foundation of Government.*

> 1. That all men are by nature equally free and independent, and have certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter into a state of society, they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.
> 16. That religion, or the duty that we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence; and, therefore, all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience and that it is the mutual duty of all to practice Christian forbearance, love, and charity towards each other.
When the words "liberty" and "rights" were used in early times, American statesmen understood those words in their true sense; and held individual liberty of conscience and freedom of religious worship as the inalienable right of every man.

The paragraph, respecting religion, in the Declaration of Rights as originally reported from the committee, read, after the word "violence," "all men should enjoy the fullest toleration in the exercise of religion;" and, consequently, on account of the term "toleration" objection was made. The Convention of Virginia held the same position (and that is the American position) as that expressed in a report adopted by the United States Senate, January 19 1829, from which the following is an extract:—

> What other nations call religious toleration, we call *religious rights.* They are not exercised in virtue of governmental indulgence; *but as rights; *of which Government cannot deprive any portion of of citizens, *however small.* Despotic power may invade those rights, but justice still confirms them.

Of Madison, who was a member of this Convention, history says:—

Religious liberty was a matter that strongly enlisted his feelings. When it was proposed that, under the new Constitution, all men should enjoy the fullest toleration in the exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience, Madison pointed out that this provision did not go to the root of the matter. The free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience, is something which every man may demand as a right, not something for which he must ask as a privilege. To grant to the State the power of tolerating is implicitly to grant to it the power of prohibiting: whereas Madison would deny to it any jurisdiction whatever in the matter of religion. The clause in the Bill of Rights, as finally adopted, at his suggestion, accordingly declares that "all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience." The incident not only illustrates Madison's liberality of spirit, but also his precision and forethought in so drawing up an instrument as to make it mean all that it was intended to mean.

It was in this form—in a form that it would declare that absolute religious liberty was an inherent right of which no earthly power could of right deprive a single individual that it passed the memorable Convention of Virginia, on the 12th day of June, 1776, without a dissenting voice.W.
