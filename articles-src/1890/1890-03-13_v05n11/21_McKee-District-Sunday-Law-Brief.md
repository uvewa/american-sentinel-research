WE are indebted to Prof. W. H. McKee Secretary of the National Religious Liberty Association, for a copy of the Brief submitted by him to the Congressional Committee on the proposed District Sunday law. We shall print it next week. Professor McKee is a graduate of Michigan University Law School, and a practical lawyer besides—having been regularly admitted to the bar in three different States—and we can assure our readers that in this Brief there is a treat in store for them.
