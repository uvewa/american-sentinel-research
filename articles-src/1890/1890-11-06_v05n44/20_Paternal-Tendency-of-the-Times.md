OF the paternal tendency of the times the *Colorado Graphic* says:—

> Now enforce the eight-hour law in all industries—for none can be omitted, to reach final results—at ten-hour wages; close all places of business at 6 o'clock P. M., and close gateways, doors, and shutters to every business and every amusement and recreation on Sunday except walking, or riding in one's private carriage, and you will establish an aristocracy with an emphatic stop which would startle the most stupid into a realization of the fact that the middle of the street is the best side of the highway when fanaticism is abroad.

And there never was a time in the history of this country when fanaticism was so general and pronounced as now.
