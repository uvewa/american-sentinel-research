THE American or secular theory of government does not mean the *un-Christian theory;* but rather the contrary. The secular theory is the *true* Christian theory; for the first promulgator of the theory known to the world, was Christ himself, the founder of Christianity. Bancroft, speaking of the adoption of these principles by our early statesmen, says: "The new Nation dared to set the example of accepting in its relations to God the principle first divinely ordained in Judea." He says, too, that it was *"not from indifference*, but that the infinite spirit of eternal truth might move in its freedom, and purity, and power." And through all the ages since Christ there have been here and there Christian men—caring more for truth than for worldly gain, caring more for the purity of Christianity than for worldly power—who have nobly upheld the principles first enunciated by their Master.

Even in our own short history, the secular theory of government has received some of its strongest support from Christian ministers and laymen in the various denominations of America. In our earlier history Roger Williams nobly espoused the theory, for which, among other things, he was compelled to flee to the Indians for refuge in mid-winter. "He fearlessly asserted that compulsory worship of God was an abomination; that, where the spirit was not a willing one, worship compelled was an offense to the Deity.... The civil magistrate," he says, "may not intermeddle even to stop a church from apostasy and heresy;... his power extends only to the bodies and goods and outward estate of men." He said boldly that "it is the will and command of God that ... a permission of the most paganish, Turkish, or anti-Christian consciences and worships to be granted to all men, in all nations and countries; and they are only to be fought against with that sword which is, in soul matters, able to conquer, to wit, the sword of God's Spirit, the word of God." In his controversy with Colton he said: "For me I must profess, while heaven and earth lasts, that no one tenet that either London, England, or the world doth harbor, is so heretical, blasphemous, seditious, and dangerous to the corporal, to the spiritual, to the present, to the eternal good of men, as the bloody tenet ... of persecution for the cause of conscience." He maintained that it is "a monstrous paradox that God's children should persecute God's children." And again: "Persecutors of men's bodies, seldom or never do these men's souls good." Mr. Eben Greenough Scott says that "no man has ever had a clearer view of the true relations existing between the civil and ecclesiastical powers."

A century and a half later, when the theory was struggling for the supremacy, and Jefferson and Madison were putting forth their energies in its behalf in Virginia, Rev. Isaac Backus and other ministers were engaged in a like work in Massachusetts. Ministers both North and South, some of them in the State Conventions on the adoption of the Federal Constitution, used their voices and influence in favor of the secular principles of our national Constitution.

In Massachusetts, one of the States where this theory was the most unpopular, several ministers espoused its cause. Some of the speeches delivered and the principles [346] enunciated are in striking contrast with the argument of the religio-political statesmen of to-day. The following summaries are from Elliot's "Debates on the Federal Constitution":

"In the Convention on Thursday [January 31, 1788], on the sixth article which provides that 4 no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office,' etc., several gentlemen urged that it was a departure from the principles of our forefathers, who came here for the preservation of their religion; and that it would admit deists, atheists, etc., into the general Government; and, people being apt to imitate the examples of the court, these principles would be disseminated, and, of course, a corruption of morals ensue. Gentlemen on the other side applauded the liberality of the clause, and represented in striking colors, the impropriety, and almost impiety, of the requisition of a test, as practiced in Great Britain, and elsewhere.

"In this conversation, the following is the substance of the observations of the—

> REV. MR. SHUTE: Mr. President, to object to the latter part of the paragraph under consideration, which excludes a religious test, is, I am sensible, very popular; for the most of men, somehow, are rigidly tenacious of their own sentiments in religion and disposed to impose them upon others as the *standard* of truth. If, in my sentiments upon the point in view, I should differ from some in this honorable Convention, I only wish from them the exercise of that candor, with which true religion is adapted to inspire the honest and well-disposed mind.

> To establish a religious test as a qualification for offices in the proposed Federal Constitution, it appears to me, sir, would be attended with injurious consequences to some individuals, and with no advantage to the *whole.* By the injurious consequences to individuals, I mean that some who, in every other respect, are qualified to fill some important post in Government, will be excluded by their not being able to stand the religious test, which I take to be a privation of part of their civil rights.
> Nor is there to me any conceivable advantage, sir, that would result to the whole from such a test. Unprincipled and dishonest men will not hesitate to subscribe to *anything* that may open the way for their advancement, and put them into a situation the better to execute their base and iniquitous de signs. *Honest men alone, therefore, however well qualified to serve the public, would be excluded by it, *and their country be deprived of the benefit of their abilities.
> In this great and extensive empire, there is, and will be, a great variety of sentiments in religion among its inhabitants. Upon the plan of a religious test, the question, I think, must be, Who shall be excluded from national trusts? Whatever answer bigotry may suggest, the dictates of candor and equity, I conceive, will be, *None.*
> Far from limiting my charity and confidence to men of my own denomination in religion, I suppose, and I believe, sir, that there are worthy characters among men of every denomination—among the Quakers, the Baptists, the Church of England, the Papists, and even among those who have no other guide in the way to virtue and Heaven than the dictates of natural religion.
> I must therefore think, sir, that the proposed plan of Government, in this particular, is wisely constituted; that, as all have equal claim to the blessings of the Government under which they live, and which they support, so none should be excluded from them for being of any particular denomination in religion. The presumption is, that the eyes of the people will be upon the faithful in the land; and, from a regard to their own safety, they will choose for their rulers men of known abilities, of known probity, of good moral characters. The Apostle Peter tells us that "God is no respecter of persons, but, in every nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is acceptable to him." And I know of no reason why men of such a character, in a community of whatever denomination in religion, *cœteris paribus,* with other suitable qualifications, should not be acceptable to the people, and why they may not be employed by them with safety and advantage in the important office of Government. The exclusion of a religious test in the proposed Constitution, therefore, clearly appears to me, sir, to be in favor of its adoption.
"Colonel Jones (of Bristol) thought that the rulers ought to believe in God or Christ, and that however a test may be prostituted in England, yet he thought if our public men were to be of those who had a good standing in the church, it would be happy for the United States, and that a person could not be a good man without being a good Christian....

"Colonel Jones said that one of his principal objections was the omission of a religious test.

> REV. MR. PAYSON: Mr. President, after what has been observed relating to a religious test, by gentlemen of acknowledged abilities, I did not expect that it would again be mentioned as an objection to the proposed Constitution that such a test was not required as a qualification for office. Such were the abilities and integrity of the gentlemen who constructed the Constitution, as not to admit of the presumption that they would have betrayed so much vanity as to erect bulwarks and barriers to the throne of God. Relying on the candor of this Convention, I shall take the liberty to express my sentiments on the nature of a religious test, and shall endeavor to do it in such propositions as will meet the approbation of every mind.

> The great object of religion being God supreme, and the seat of religion in man being the heart or conscience, *i. e.,* the reason God has given us, employed on our moral actions, in their most important consequences, as related to the tribunal of God; hence, I infer that God alone is God of the conscience, and, consequently, attempts to erect human tribunals for the consciences of men are impious encroachments upon the prerogatives of God. Upon these principles, had there been a religious test as a qualification for office, it would, in my opinion, have been a great blemish upon the instrument.
> Rev. Dr. Backus, the New England historian, also delivered the following in the same Convention, on Monday, February 4:—
> REV. MR. BACKUS: Mr. President, I have said very little to this honorable Convention; but I now beg leave to offer a few thoughts upon some points in the Constitution proposed to us, and I shall begin with the exclusion of any religious test. Many appear to be much concerned about it; but nothing is more evident, both in reason and the Holy Scriptures, than that religion is ever a matter between God and individuals; and, therefore, no man or men can impose any religious test without invading the essential prerogatives of our Lord Jesus Christ. Ministers first assumed this power under the Christian name; and then Constantine approved of the practice, when he adopted the profession of Christianity as an engine of State policy. And let the history of all nations be searched from that day to this, and it will appear that the imposing of religious tests has been the greatest engine of tyranny in the world. And I rejoice to see so many gentlemen who are now giving in their rights of conscience in this great and important matter. Some serious minds discover a concern lest if all religious tests should be excluded, the Congress would hereafter establish popery or some other tyrannical way of worship. But it is most certain that no such way of worship can be established without any religious tests.
As a result of the unselfish labors of these liberal Christian ministers, united with the great statesmen of the times, our Nation to-day has the secular theory of Government established upon a firm foundation; and this liberal Christian theory is silently influencing the world. Every government on earth feels its effects; and as a result all religions are tolerated more or less by nearly every government on the face of the earth. These liberal principles are the outgrowth of the doctrines taught by Christ and put into our national political system by the joint efforts of liberal Christian ministers and philosophical statesmen, and the good done to religion and humanity will be an everlasting monument to those noble men whose efforts were not put forth in vain.
