A DECISION has been rendered lately by the Supreme Court of the State of Indiana, which holds that the carrying of passengers to and from a picnic on Sunday is unlawful.

As, by this decision, the highest judicial authority of the State has declared, in effect, all labor, other than works of necessity and mercy, to be illegal on Sunday, therefore, according to the National Reform doctrine, the Hoosier State has become a Christian commonwealth and has instituted a local millennium. The eyes of the world will now be turned upon this favored State. Henry George will hasten to become a citizen where every man will sit under his own vine and fig tree with no tariff bill to molest or make him afraid; and Edward Bellamy will pack up his fountain pen and case of pencils, and immediately betake himself to the land where religious nationalism is ushering in the age so aptly termed, "Looking Backward."
