AT the Indian Conference at Lake Mo- honk, N. Y., October 10, Dr. James M. King, of New York, Secretary of the National League for the Protection of American Liberties, spoke earnestly against the granting of appropriations to religious denominations for public educational work. General Armstrong argued that there is no better way than to give aid to the contract schools. Bishop Whipple said that the influence of the contract schools had been to uplift the whole character of the Government schools. The position of Bishop Whipple was sustained by General Howard, of Chicago, Rev. Mr. Mitchell, of the Presbyterian Board of Missions, and others. A speedy separation of Church and State in the matter of Indian education was advocated by Rev. Dr. Foster, of Boston, and very strongly by Dr. Lyman Abbott.
