A PRESBYTERIAN lady, of Indianapolis, writes to a friend in California, as follows:—

> Look at the Sunday question. Why! I think the ministers are now more interested in looking out for its "proper observance" than in preaching the gospel.

> Indianapolis is all aflame, because the street-cars run to the suburban resorts, the ministers all meeting, and resolving, and organizing, through the hot weather, except *one.* He and his wife, who could sing, and play the organ, went out to one of these resorts in a little spring wagon, used it for a pulpit, and preached to the people, and had a quiet respectful audience.
> Now why can not the others do the same thing,— go where the poor and the vicious are, and teach them the divine law, and stop clamoring for human laws to compel them to come to the churches?
Certainly, why can they not? It is because they are possessed with the idea of "Nationalism" in religion. This "Christian Nation" having become an accountable being, all individual responsibility is to be shouldered upon its "moral person."
