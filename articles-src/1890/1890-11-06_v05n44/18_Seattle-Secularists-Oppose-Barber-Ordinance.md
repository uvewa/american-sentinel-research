THE Seattle Secularists have sent a remonstrance to the mayor against a proposed ordinance fining barbers for Sunday work. Such a law, they hold, would "relegate honest work to the realm of crime." And that is just what all Sunday laws do; they make to be a crime on one day that which is commendable upon all other days.
