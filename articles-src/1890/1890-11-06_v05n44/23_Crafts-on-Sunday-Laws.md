MR. CRAFTS says: "In other countries, where Church and State are mixed, and in our own country in other days, the ground of Sunday laws has been not always clearly perceived; but in recent years legislation on this subject has been based, not on God's will, but on the general welfare." It is true that within the last few years an effort has been made to keep in the background the real reason for demanding Sunday laws, but that the effort has not been eminently successful is shown by every discourse which Mr. Crafts gives. His declaration, "Take the religion out and you take the rest out," upsets all his fine spun theories about the civil basis of Sunday legislation.
