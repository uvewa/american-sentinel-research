THE ministers of Omaha have declared themselves opposed to funerals on Sunday. Upon this fact the *Investigator,* Atlantic, Iowa, remarks as follows:—

> These ministers doubtless think if a man is so heedless as to die upon Friday or Saturday, he must wait until Monday for interment "with the benefit of clergy." What right has a man to depart this life at such time that his burial must take place on the day of rest? Why shall he not go on Monday or Tuesday, and thus save all danger of offending the pulpit by his being entombed on the Sabbath? He who would thus break in upon the rest of the preachers and deacons, deserves not to die at all. If he may do this with impunity, this day will soon be "secularized," and turned into one of wholesale interment. It behooves the friends of the Sabbath to rise up as one man in opposition to the reprehensible custom among people, of dying when they are ready. But, seriously, cannot the Omaha gentlemen of the cloth find evils more deserving of their attention than this one?

Well, "seriously," it seems not; for the mint, anise and cummin are receiving the lion's share of attention, while the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith, are neglected. And this is true in more places than Omaha.
