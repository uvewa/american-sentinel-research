THERE is being put forth in Chicago a strong effort to raise again the question of the Bible in the public schools. But all signs point to a definite refusal of the Protestants to enter upon the discussion. Minister after minister has refused to have anything to do with the movement. It is felt very generally that the superficial reading of a chapter by a teacher, who is often not in sympathy with the Book, would avail nothing, and that the complaints of the Roman Catholic parents would be justified, if the King James version were used. And any such movement would only serve to strengthen the hands of those who constantly point to the public school as an enemy to their faith. Indeed, it has at best the decided disadvantage of relieving, in appearance, the parents of responsibility in the matter of the religious training of their children. *—Rev. T. C. Hall, in New York Observer, Oct. 23.*
