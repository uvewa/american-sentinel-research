WHILE there remains a sect on the face of the earth that claims to follow the teachings of an inspired book different from the Scriptures, or while there remains a people who deny its inspiration, the Word of God must be sectarian.

If the Christian Bible is not sectarian, the Koran is not, nor any of the books regarded sacred and peculiar to other sects than that of Christianity.

It is a fact that worldly opinion holds the reins of government on this earth; and that, as the Scripture teaches, we are in the land of the enemy. It is not because worldly opinion says so that makes the Testament sectarian; but the fact of existent conflicting beliefs is what makes the guide book of any one of these sectarian.

Therefore to try to force the Bible as non-sectarian in the public schools supported by atheists, infidels, Jews, and Christians alike, is contrary to civil law; and a reflection on those who should above all others be familiar with the Golden Rule.

If the Christians can place the book of their exclusive belief within a public institution, then by the same logic the disbeliever has the right to be heard in his defense, and the Mormon also, and the Jew, and the Buddhist, and every other religion that contributes to the school, has the right of representation. They are all good citizens, and no one religion has any right above another in our land of freedom.

It was because one religion was favored above all others by legislation, that nearly two thousand years ago the civil law condemned Christ; since which time kingdoms and nations have crumbled and disappeared, while the Christian religion has for the first time, because our Nation looks on all alike, found here full freedom for its immeasurable works of good. Let not our Nation be the first to invade these rights of equality.

"The Bible," a contemporary truly says, "has outlived and triumphed over all other books, and is to-day gradually ascending as never before, taking on itself 'new tongues' and spreading open its pages to every land, and islands of the sea." As a book for the church, the home circle, and the individual, it has blessed and been blessed, marvelously. But why not let it continue these glorious achievements? Why leave its sacred realm, to invade the property belonging to all creeds alike, to violate the grandest system of religious equality that ever existed?

The Bible is in its proper sphere. Let it remain where it stands, and do not make it a public-school text book.—*Moral and Scientific Companion. *[350]
