# A Candid Prohibitionist.

WRITING to the *California Voice*, Mr. John Robinson, of Guerneville, California, says:—

> The Adventists do not ask that their day be selected as the day of rest, but demand that legislation on the matter be omitted entirely.

To this the *Signs of the Times* adds this comment:—

> Adventists consistently oppose all Sabbath legislation. They have the privilege and right of a day of rest; no one ought to ask more. What hinders our Sunday-law people from resting on Sunday, if they so desire?

Again, Mr. Robinson, who, by the way, is a Prohibitionist, and not an Adventist, says:—

> The “toiler” does not ask for this legislation, and no effort is being made to prevent the masses from resting one day in seven.

And this is simply a plain statement of a well-known fact: the demand for Sunday laws comes not from the working masses, but from those who are inspired by a mistaken religious zeal.

Of the Sunday-law plank in the Prohibition platform, the same gentleman says:—

> You may proclaim as long and loudly as you desire that this plank does not mean Sunday law, but simply a day of rest, on Monday, Tuesday, or on any day, but so long as the masses believe it means Sunday, the effect will be the same, viz., to prevent the success of our party. The fact is, Sunday is the day generally intended; there is no use denying this. Sunday is a religious institution; laws to enforce a religious institution is religious legislation and will not be indorsed by a majority of the voters of this country.

Would that all Prohibitionists were as candid.

“IT is this ‘innocent recreation, ’” says the New York *Observer,* “advocated by Cardinal Gibbons and Liberal Protestants, that destroys the idea of Sunday being a holy day.” The inference is that the State should forbid innocent recreation. It is this thought that inspires the demand for Sunday laws on the part of churches and church papers. [335-336]

TROUBLE over the reading of the Bible in the public schools is reported from the Western Reserve, in Ohio. A parent complains that the teacher to whom his children are sent, persists in devoting a portion of each day to scriptural reading, and as his children are compelled to be present, according to the school-room rule, he demands to know whether he cannot legally withdraw his children during that hour.

IN an article in the *Evangel of Rest, *Rev. J. M. Hamilton quotes Lev. 19:30: “Ye shall keep my Sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary,” and applies it to Sunday - keeping and attendance upon church services! Ps. 87:2, and 132:14, are wrested in like manner; while Isa. 66:23, is tortured into a command for everybody to go to meeting upon the first day of the week! And that he calls teaching divine truth!

COMMENTING upon the Tennessee Sunday-law cases, a London, England, paper says:—

> “All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.” Matt. 7:12. If this rule of conduct were followed, we should have no occasion to report such cases as these prosecutions in Tennessee under the Sunday law. This State has had a bad record for a few years past, in this respect.

This is true, but the Golden Rule has no place in the code of those who make and enforce Sunday laws.

AT the semi-annual meeting of the bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in this city, in May, the *Pearl of Days *says the following resolutions were unanimously adopted:—

> *Resolved,* That we are gratified at the information received concerning the organization of the American Sabbath Union and approve of the work thus far accomplished, and we look to it for efficient aid in rescuing the land from the curse of Sabbath desecration.

> *Resolved* That we respectfully call the immediate attention of the officers of the society to the growing evil of Sunday receptions and Sunday dinner parties in Washington, D. C., and in other cities of the Republic.
It is in order for the bishops next to state how they intend that the American Sabbath Union shall stop, or even check, Sunday receptions and Sunday dinner parties. . The object of the Union is to secure laws for the preservation of Sunday observance. Do the bishops intend that the American Sabbath Union shall secure the enactment of laws forbidding the giving of receptions or dinner parties on Sunday? This shows plainly enough that a law prohibiting work on Sunday, would not be by any means the end of the Sunday tale.

ONE of our exchanges, the *Loyal American*, notes the fact that “the prisoners in the Stillwater prison, Minn., publish a weekly paper, the *Prison Mirror*, at one dollar per annum. It is edited and printed by the convicts.” And yet like a great many other people, the editor of the *American* insists that the State should educate its citizens *to prevent crime!* Education is a good thing, a very good thing, but as a preventive of crime it is not much of a success. Thousands of men in the penitentiaries of the various States, and thousands more who ought to be “doing time,” are educated men. If only the illiterate were dishonest and vicious, the amount of business transacted by our criminal courts would be very much less than it is.

IT is stated that Secretary Dickinson of the World’s Fair Commission, is deluged with letters and protests against Sunday opening. So numerous are they that he has been compelled to have circulars printed acknowledging their receipt. In the number of petitions the Christian Endeavor Society heads the list, half the petitions and remonstrances coming from branches of that organization; then comes individual churches, then the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union. “Already,” says the *Mail and Express*, “it is evident that the opposition to Sunday opening will be the most formidable demonstration of its kind ever made in the country.” We wonder if in this, as in the matter of a national Sunday law, the petitioners are to be counted several times.

SOME time since, Mr. Crafts visited Denver, and delivered several discourses upon the Sunday-law question. In an editorial notice of his work, the *News* of that city says:—

> The difficulty arises when we come to define rest, and to specify what may and what may not be done. It would be interesting to catechize Dr. Crafts on that subject in the presence of one of his large audiences. When he approaches it he has a habit of generalizing, and if he becomes specific he hastens his gait and touches his points lightly. It needs no analysis, however, to see the drift of the legislation he advocates. He would have the civil power enforce a religious conception of Sunday observance, save that he would forego compulsory attendance at church. He would ostracize Sunday amusement, no matter how innocent, and entertainments, no matter how instructive. He would interdict the masses of city population from going to any suburban resort on the only day of the seven when it is in their power to breath country air. Just where he would draw the line who can tell? Modern rapid transit has wonderfully favored metropolitan resorts, and our cable and electric lines would clearly have to stop on Sunday to meet Mr. Crafts’s requirements, or at least shorten their rim on that day so that the toiling classes should not be taken beyond the murky atmosphere that characterizes most of our large cities.

The *News* is in favor of a Sunday law that would close saloons, factories, etc., but it is not prepared to agree to Mr. Crafts’s so-called “civil Sunday” scheme. It sees very plainly that what he is really working for, is, as it says, a law that would enforce a religious rest, and it wants nothing of the kind. And this opposition, it appears, is not because of opposition to religion, but simply from opposition to State interference in matters of religion.

THE *Sabbath Harbinger* is the name of a new 24-column monthly, “religious family paper, devoted to missionary work and Sabbath reform in the South.” It is published by the Southern Sabbath Publishing Association, Beauregard, Miss. “It will be,” says the publishers, “uncompromisingly opposed to anything tending toward the encroachments, usurpations, and assumed authority of a hierarchy, either in name or in fact, let it come from whatever source it may.” If this promise is redeemed, the *Harbinger* will oppose the work of the American Sabbath Union, and the schemes of the National Reform Association .

A REPORT of a committee at a recent Sunday-law meeting in California, contains this statement: “The public ought to be thoroughly informed of the reasons for the Sunday closing of saloons.” Well the reason is not far to seek, nor hard to state; it is simply a desire on the part of one part of the community to honor the first day of the week because they regard it as the Sabbath by divine appointment. If the motive were purely or even primarily a temperance one they would demand the closing of saloons on all days.

ARE there many people in this country who would be pleased to see the United States governed as Ecuador is? Perhaps not, but there are many thousands of people among us who are striving to bring about a union of Church and State, and if they are successful it will only be a question of time—a comparatively short time—when the only difference between the United States and Ecuador, will be in the number of population and the area of territory.—*American Standard. *[337]
