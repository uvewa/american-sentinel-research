"SIBERIA and the Nihilists," consisting of an able lecture by Hon. William Jackson Armstrong, late Inspector General of United States Consulates, and some exceedingly interesting correspondence between Mr. Armstrong and George Kennan, is one of the most intensely interesting books which has ever found its way to our table. Everybody should read this book because no one can be intelligent upon the subject of which it treats without a familiarity with its contents. Twenty- five cents, Pacific Press, Oakland Cal., and 43 Bond St., New York. [353]
