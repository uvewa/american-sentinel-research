## Declaration Of Principles.

> We believe in the religion taught by Jesus Christ.

> We believe in temperance, and regard the liquor traffic as a curse to society.
> We believe in supporting the civil government, and submitting to its authority.
> We deny the right of any civil government to legislate on religious questions.
> We believe it is the right, and should be the privilege, of every man to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience.

THE American Sabbath Union, of the United States, has its peer in the “Lord’s Day Alliance,” of Canada, in which most of the Protestant denominations of the Dominion are said to be represented The Presbyterian Church seems, there, to take the initiative, as it does here. At a late meeting of the Presbyterian General Assembly the Committee of Sabbath observance presented a set of resolutions which were adopted. The following are the fourth and fifth resolutions in the series:—

> 4. That the Assembly records its approval of the effort now being made to obtain from Parliament a Sabbath law for the whole Dominion, recommends presbyteries and kirk sessions to take action in support of it by petition or any other way that may be deemed efficient, and that the Assembly again forward to Parliament a petition in favor of such legislation.

> 5. That the Assembly expresses its gratification at the cordial co-operation of all the Protestant denominations, as manifested in the Lord’s Day Alliance of Canada, and appoints as its representatives in the Alliance the members of the Sabbath Observance Committee.
THE Young Men’s Christian Association of Trenton, New Jersey, has committed itself to an open affiliation with the American Sabbath Union. The following item is published by the *Pearl of Days:—*

> Last Sunday was a field day for the Sabbath cause in the capital city of New Jersey. In addition to sermons and addresses by the secretaries of the American Sabbath Union, the Rev. Drs. Knowles and Taylor, and by Rev. Dr. Dunn, a great meeting was held at 4 P. M. in Taylor’s Opera House, under the auspices of the Young Men’s Christian Association, at which Col. E. F. Shepard, president of the American Sabbath Union, eloquently addressed over two thousand one hundred men, on “The Sabbath for man.” Resolutions were unanimously adopted in favor of changing the inauguration of the President of the United States from the 4th of March to the first Wednesday of that month, and also for the closing of the Columbian Exposition on Sundays. The last resolution was adopted by a rising vote of the whole assembly. This series of meetings was marked by the profound interest and enthusiasm of the thousands of hearers. Similar meetings will also be held in other cities during the coming season.

It is by these slow approaches and imperceptible degrees, that the Young Men’s Christian Association will be at last captured for the National Reform party. In Chicago it has allied itself with the movement for the closing of the World’s Fair on Sunday. Through their gradual advances, beginning first with those things which seem in themselves so harmless, and, in fact, from a mistaken view, so necessary to be consistent in their profession of Christianity, the Young Men’s Christian Association will be led into the realm of politics at last. Heretofore they have steadfastly avoided an alliance so fatal to the true Christianity of the Association, but the American Sabbath Union and the National Reform Association are proving too subtile and too strong for them.
