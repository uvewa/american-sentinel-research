MR. CRAFTS argues that California should have a Sunday law because "in its capital city there are only five or six churches, mostly small." Just so; we have repeatedly said that the real purpose of the demand for Sunday laws is to benefit the churches, and we are glad of another virtual admission of the fact by one who is in a position to know just how it is.
