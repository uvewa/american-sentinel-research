THE *Christian Advocate*, of this city, objects to political meetings on Sunday. It says:—

> Political meetings in churches, with bands, stirring music and applause "that makes the old church ring," are not good meetings for Sabbaths, no matter what the cause is. The great foes of the American Sabbath in settled communities are excursions, Sunday newspapers, Sunday camp-meetings with open gates, political meetings, comic lectures under the guise of sermons, and concerts profanely called sacred.

This indicates very clearly the drift of the Sunday-law movement. Where they have no Sunday law such laws are demanded, professedly, in order to give the workingman a day of rest. Where such laws already exist the demand is that they be so amended as to forbid everything on Sunday not recognized by the churches as religious.
