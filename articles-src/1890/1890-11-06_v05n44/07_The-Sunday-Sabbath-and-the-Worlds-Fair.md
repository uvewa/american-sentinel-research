"THE Sunday-Sabbath and the World's Fair," was the subject of a sermon preached by Rev. Mr. Utter—one of the most popular Chicago preachers—Sunday evening, October 19.

Mr. Utter begun his sermon by reading an extract from a former sermon, preached last March, immediately after the decision was reached in Congress locating the World's Fair in that city. This extract was read both to show his present position upon the subject of opening the Fair on Sunday, and that he had been first, at least among the ministers, in Chicago, to advocate this.

During the discourse, he also took occasion to say that he believed he stood almost, if not quite, alone among the clergy in the advocacy of Sunday opening, even now. The scheme of having religious services in a great temple on the Fair grounds for the accomodation of those who might like to attend, which has been recently proposed by Prof. Swing and others, was also set forth at length in this sermon of the second of March.

But let the extract speak for itself:—

> I would have the exhibition open on Sunday, if not all day, at least in the afternoon. And on this day it should be free, or the price of admission should be exceedingly low at least to all people with children, and certainly to all people who could show that they had worked the six preceding days. I think this might be arranged in some such way as this, have all employers of labor furnished with tickets to give freely to their employes.

> And I think it would be a great and good thing to have a sort of object lesson in religion continually before these visitors to the Fair, and for that I hope we might arrange for a continuous series of religious services in a great temple built for the purpose on the grounds, the services to begin at about one o'clock on the Sunday, and continue, it might be a service every hour, until nine o'clock in the evening.
> There should be a committee consisting of representative men from each country in the world, which might be called the Central Committee on Religious Services, whose duty it should be to arrange that representative men from all countries, men speaking all languages, should preach to whomsoever would hear them on the exhibition grounds. It might be found practicable to have several halls or chapels, and to have five or six of these services going on each hour from one to nine as I have said, in as many different languages.
> And for myself, I would be glad to have every doctrine under heaven, the doctrine of every sect of religion I mean, preached here by the ablest representatives. To be sure some of the great religions do not do much at preaching, theirs would be the loss, and perhaps ours the gain. The Brahmins do not preach much, nor do the followers of Confucius, but I have an idea that the Buddhists could furnish some good preachers, and the Parsees would send us some men who would preach well, I am sure. Mr. Mazoomdar should come to represent the Brahmin-Somaj of India, and the Mohammedans should send somebody to represent them, and so we could have every Sunday afternoon and evening well occupied by able men who should speak to us, in many languages, the thoughts of the Old World and the New on the greatest themes that have ever occupied human thought.
> If this programme is too broad to be successfully carried out, if we are so sure that we are right that we must have only representatives of the Christian religion; if we are so sure that we have the truth that we are unwilling to hear what others think is true, why then I shall be sorry, but even if the programme must be narrowed, still let it be carried out in a measure. Let us have the Roman Catholic, the Episcopalian, and so on through all the sects of the Christian Church, and let each have his appointed time of service, and conduct the service in his own way, and preach and give reasons for the faith that is in him.
> No danger that the exhibits of the arts and industries and products of men would take the people away from these religious services on the Exposition grounds. There is no subject lies so near to the hearts of men as this of religion, none which, when presented ably and eloquently, can so move the souls of men towards high resolve and stimulate high attainment, so command attention for the time and intention and work in the future, as the preaching of religion. And so I say, whatever else the exhibition is, becomes or does, let it be open on Sunday free, and let provision be made for what might be called an international exhibition of religious speech, a declaration of religious faith and hope and teaching of all the world.
> This scheme seems to me a practical one, and I believe in my heart and soul that it is good. And if you, my friends, think so, then let us say it and work for it and accomplish it, and then we shall see, perhaps, more fully than we do now, that from a religious standpoint the International Exposition of Chicago is a great and worthy subject of contemplation by thoughtful and earnest men everywhere.
Mr. Utter then continued without notes, in substance, as follows:—

"In that sermon I also urged that all saloons in the city should be closed on Sunday at least, if not during the entire period of the Exposition, and that no liquors or strong drink of any kind should be sold at any time on the exhibition grounds.

"My reasons for believing, when I preached the former sermon, that it would be good policy to have the Exposition open on Sunday still seem to me as forcible as ever. It is, if not the only day, yet the best day for the working people to attend the Fair. There are thousands of people in this city who work so continuously, to whom holidays come so seldom, that they really have no other time in which they could afford to visit the Fair. For they would on any other day have to lose the salary for that day, as well as pay the price of admission.

"But it is not my intention to repeat the arguments, as all arguments, *pro* and *con*, have been so well stated in the public press. I allude to them now to say that [348] they are all founded upon what we believe to be good policy simply.

"But I freely grant that nothing should be done because in some aspects it might seem to be good policy, if it was really wrong. There are those who think it would be wrong to open the Fair on Sunday, because they say there is a divine command forbidding anything or everything on Sunday, except rest and worship. I do not think there is any such command. Minister though I am, and interested as I am in having Sunday in general spent as we people in Chicago spend it, using it for a day of worship, a day of rest and of intellectual culture and recreation, yet I cannot see that there would be anything wrong in opening the Fair on Sunday, for purposes of rest and recreation to those who would find both in attending the Fair.

"But nothing really wrong should ever be done because it might be thought to be good policy. If it is wrong to do any manner of work on Sunday, then let us do no manner of work. Let us agitate the matter until all shops are closed. Let us no longer use the steam-cars or the street-cars, nor read Sunday papers, nor even Monday papers, since they involve work on Sunday. Let us be consistent about it if it is wrong to do any work on Sunday.

"But is it wrong? And if so, why? To answer these questions, or to show why it has been thought contrary to the divine will to use Sunday for any purpose except for worship and for rest, involves a great deal of history, the discussion of a long and somewhat complicated question. I will not go into the matter very deeply, and there is no need that I should, as you have all doubtless been over it again and again. I will only 'stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance.'

"The origin of the Sunday Sabbath begins with the origin of the Sabbath of the Jews, and that is connected with the origin of the week, and that goes back beyond all human history.

"Recurring to the matter of the Sabbath and Sunday, I need not pause to explain the way in which the Jews kept their Sabbath day, but will only say that their day was the seventh of the week, Saturday. But as we are not Jews but Christians, the question for us is, first, how did Christ regard the Sabbath? He seems to have been quite liberal in his views of the day and its uses. Nearly every difficulty or dispute that he had with the Jews of his time, as recorded by the evangelists, began in or involved accusations made against him as a violator of the Sabbath. To be sure they were very particular, extreme, even to the point of foolishness, in their requirements in regard to the day. But Jesus annunciated the principle, that the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.

He said also that it should be lawful always to do good on the Sabbath day.

"What did Jesus say in regard to Sunday? Nothing whatever so far as we know. What is taught in the New Testament in regard to the change, abrogating the old Sabbath and transferring the sacredness of one seventh of the time from Saturday to Sunday? Not a word, not a syllable in the New Testament.

"Where them is there any divine authority for making Sunday a holy day The Catholic Church can consistently show some authority, but not such as will satisfy Protestants. They can show that the 'mother church' has, during all of its history kept Sunday as a sort of Sabbath, kept it holy in the way in which they keep it to-day. That the ' mother-church' tradition is authority, the church is an infallible authority, her word is final. But the Catholic way of keeping Sunday is not strict enough for Protestants, and neither is the Catholic authority sufficient. Protestants believe in the religion of the Bible, and in that book is not one word to show the sacredness of Sunday.

"The early Christians were undoubtedly, the majority of them, keepers of the seventh day during the first, and at least a part of the second century. As the new religion progressed westward, and was embraced by people not of Jewish birth, the Sabbath of the Jews was less and less regarded. And as the Church spread more and more widely into different countries several days were kept sacred. Friday was perhaps the most popular day of all as a day of fasting, prayer, and worship, then Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath, was also kept as a day of rest and worship. Sunday was the feast celebrating Christ's resurrection. Tuesday was also kept as a holy day in some places.

"Uniformity in regard to the day to be kept holy by Christians was secured, as every one knows, under the edict of Constantine. His word was that upon the 'venerable day of the Sun' all courts of justice, all workshops, and people of villages should be at rest. He made an exception in regard to agricultural laborers, saying that sometimes it was necessary that their work should be done. But even under Constantine the Sunday did not become a Sabbath in the sense in which it was made a Sabbath in New England by our ancestors. There, for the first time in the world, or there at least more completely than ever before, except perhaps in some few places in old England, Sunday was made after the exact pattern of the Jewish Sabbath. No manner of work to be done therein, no recreation, simply rest and worship were allowable. This our forefathers did because of their literal manner of interpreting the Bible. They felt obliged to take it all as one book and make it all consistent one part with another. And so they must obey the decalogue of Moses, and yet they could not adopt the Jewish seventh-day Sabbath. So they made the Sunday Sabbath, although neither they nor anybody else was ever able, consistently or clearly, to show when or why or where the sacredness was transferred from one day to the other.

"This glance at the history of the case will suffice to indicate my reason for saying that there is no divine command prohibiting the use of the first day of the week in any human and entirely rational way. I believe, as I have said, very earnestly and sincerely, in using the day for religious purposes, for intellectual purposes, in using it as a day for social and literary culture and improvement, a day for writing letters, for seeing one's friends, for walking or riding, or finding healthful and quiet recreation and rest in whatever way is best for body and mind.

"And I deem it not inconsistent with this that we should open the great Fair, police it properly, have it all orderly and safe, and allow people to visit it on the Sunday. And I believe that the more we come to see that this day is sacred simply because of the good human uses we make of it, the more clearly we see that it is sacred to human use as well as to divine service, the more cheerfully and the more truly holy we will keep it. The truest service of God is very often, if not always, that which is most helpful to man. So should it be with our keeping the Sunday. And it will help rather than hinder this rational use of Sunday to understand that we keep it as we do rather for our own good than for the sake of pleasing God."
