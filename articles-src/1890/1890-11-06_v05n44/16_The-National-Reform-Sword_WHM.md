THE Washington *Star,* of October 20, contains a "special" from Baltimore, dated Sunday the 19th, which says:—

> A great crowd of the best German citizens are tonight excited and very indignant over the action of the police in stopping the lecture which was to have been given at Germania Mannerchor Hall, by Arthur Koebner, of New York. For some reason an old law was resurrected yesterday, and to-night the authorities stated that no entertainment of any sort for which an admission was demanded could take place in Baltimore on Sunday if any one objected thereto. The crowd denounced the decision and the authorities. The statute has been practically dead so long that even the District Attorney knew not of its existence until yesterday.

In a late utterance, Wilbur F. Crafts, speaking in reference to Sunday closing of the Exposition at Chicago, warned those who are opposing religious legislation not to say, that "law is useless because unused. The sword is there ready whenever Chicago's citizens reach out the hand to wield it."

Mr. Crafts is right, the sword of religious law, rusty and stained with the blood of over fifty millions of Christian martyrs, is lying sheathed in the statutory crypts of almost every code of laws in the United States. The sword awaits ' ' the hand to wield it." What can be more evident than the purpose of the National Reform party, and the American Sabbath Union, to find hands willing to wield this unused sword.

In the same connection it is also said that to open the coming Exposition on Sunday would be to break "the common law of the whole country." This is an echo of the utterance of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia, that, as Blackstone declares "Christianity to be part of the laws of England," therefore, it is a part of the laws of the United States, and to be enforced as such.

If we are to accept this as a truth, we must define the scope of the common law on this subject by Blackstone's words, "Such crimes and misdemeanors as more immediately offend Almighty God, by openly transgressing the precepts of religion either natural or revealed." Under this, apostasy, renunciation of Christianity, or perversion to Judaism, paganism, or other false religion, is punishable with three year's imprisonment, and deprivation of the right to bring any action as guardian, executor, legatee, or purchaser of lands.

The offense of heresy at common law consists of a public denial of some of the essential doctrines of Christianity, and although just what heresy definitely is seems always to have been more or less uncertain, nevertheless we have by the statutes 9 and 10, Wm. II. c. 32., the same penalty as for apostasy pronounced upon those who, educated in or professing the Christian religion, shall "deny any one of the persons in the Holy Trinity to be God or maintain that there are more gods than one."

Blasphemy or profanity, "denying the existence of God or scoffing at the Scriptures . . . are offenses punishable at common law by fine and imprisonment or other infamous corporal punishment."

Witchcraft, and the telling of fortunes, "is still deservedly punished with a year's imprisonment and standing four times in the pillory."

"Profanation of the Lord's day, vulgarly (but improperly), called Sabbath breaking," is a finable offense by the statutes 27 Hen. VI. c. 5., and 29 Car. II. c. 7.

All religious impostors, also, who claim a "commission from heaven or terrify and abuse the people with false denunciations of judgments," may be subjected in the civil courts to fine and imprisonment.

The authority of these ancient English laws was invoked to stop a Sunday game of baseball in the District of Columbia. In Pennsylvania, a forgotten statute of 1794 has been used to close barber shops on Sunday, and now in Baltimore, a law of the existence of which even the prosecuting attorney was in ignorance, so antiquated was it, has been resurrected to prevent a Sunday evening lecture.

It is true, the sword of the Sabbath Union is hidden in every pile of law books.W. H. M. [351-352]
