WE publish this week the sermon of Rev. Mr. Utter, of Chicago, on "The Sunday-Sabbath and the World's Fair." This we do, more to show the division which exists among Sunday observers upon this question, than because we fully agree with the scheme which he proposes. We see no reason why the Fair should be made a monster exhibition of the religions of the world. Indeed, it is not clear to us that Mr. Utter's plan does not embody features quite as objectionable as those involved in Sunday-closing.
