"MERE education," says the New York *Christian Advocate*, of October 23, "will not make a man either moral or religious. Burchall, just found guilty of murder, a few days after the body of his victim was found, applied for a school, in which he said, 'I am twenty-nine years of age, and was educated at Oxford University, England, where I took a high position in mathematics, English subjects, and natural science. I am a good classical and French scholar, and passed high examinations in Holy Scripture.' This is all true, and yet there is no doubt of his having committed a most cold-blooded, cunningly conceived murder for money."
