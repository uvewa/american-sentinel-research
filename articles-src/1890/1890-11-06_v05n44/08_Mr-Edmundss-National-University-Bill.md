IF the plan which Senator Edmunds proposes seems weak, the weakness must not be laid upon him. It is innate and essential in the scheme itself. The government of the university is to be vested in a Board of Regents consisting of the President, the Chief Justice, the Cabinet *ex-officio*, and twelve members appointed by a concurrent resolution of Congress. Of course, the *ex-officio* members would have little or no time to take part in the government of the university. Their duties to the Government of the United States would be enough to occupy their time. The other members would, probably, be appointed with regard to their politics rather than their attainments. The patronage of an institution with an endowment of $5,000, 000 would be a plum not to be despised. Politics is an excellent thing, but in literature, in science, in art, in learned research, and investigation there is no place for politics. What a queer set of professors and fellows, a national university, the creature of Congress, would be likely to turn out!

A whimsical part of Mr. Edmunds's bill is the provision that no sectarian doctrine or belief shall be taught or promoted in the [349] university, but this prohibition shall not exclude the study of Christian theology. Hebrews, not to speak of agnostics, and atheists, would be justified in objecting to the teaching of Christian theology in a national university. And where does Mr. Edmunds expect to find a theological faculty that can teach Christian theology without maintaining doctrines and beliefs that will be regarded as sectarian by some body or other of Christian believers? His only refuge must be in some vague phrase about "the fundamentals of the Christian religion," but what seems vital and fundamental to one religious communion may seem accidental and unessential to another. Not even a theological faculty composed of scholarly and indifferent agnostics could avoid the teaching of some special doctrines.—*The Sun*.
