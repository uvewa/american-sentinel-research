THE Baptist Ministers' Conference closed at Lockport, New York, on the 29th ult., with a direct blow at the effort of certain misguided religionists to create a public sentiment in favor of introducing religious instruction into the public schools of the State, by refusing to co-operate in this attempt, and holding that it would tend to the establishment of schools at State expense, in which would be taught the principles of many creeds. If the State may direct religion in schools, the Conference holds, it can in churches.
