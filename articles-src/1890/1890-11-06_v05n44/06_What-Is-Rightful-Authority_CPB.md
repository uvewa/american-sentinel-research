THE *Truth Seeker* quotes us as follows: "Both Christ and the apostles taught submission to rightful authority;" and then triumphantly asks, "Is not a State Legislature rightful authority?" It also inquires why we do not "submit to the Sunday laws of the various States instead of resorting to the courts to oppose them."

We scarcely think that the *Truth Seeker *is candid in asking these questions. It certainly knows that we did not use the term "authority" in the sense of "a body exercising power or command," but in the sense of "power" itself. (See Webster's first and second definition of "authority.")

In one sense a properly constituted legislative body is a "rightful authority," but it does not follow that all its acts are necessarily a legitimate exercise of authority. Legislatures not infrequently violate the Constitution under which they are supposed to act; and when they do, it is the right of any citizen to appeal to the courts for that protection which the Constitution guarantees him. This is just what the friends of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL do in the matter of Sunday laws. They oppose, not rightful authority, but a most unwarranted usurpation by the State of power that belongs alone to God. They "render to Cesar the things that are Cesar's, and to God the things that are God's," and refuse to obey the State only when, like the magistrates referred to in Acts 4:5-19, it commands that which involves the violation of the law of God. We utterly repudiate the pagan theory to which the *Truth Seeker* seems to be wedded, namely, that the State is supreme in all things.

The editor of the *Truth Seeker* does not like to have us array Thomas Paine, the great infidel, against him, nevertheless we will venture to remind him that infidels who practice what they preach, who are willing to grant to others the same liberty to obey God that they claim *not* to obey him, admit the very principle for which we contend, namely, that no human power has any right whatever to come between the individual soul and his God. On this point Paine, says:—

> There is a single idea, which, if it strikes rightly upon the mind, either in a legal or a religious sense, will prevent any man or any body of men, or any government, from going wrong on the subject of religion; which is, that before any human institutions of government were known in the world, there existed, if I may so express it, a compact between God and man, from the beginning of time; and that as the relation and condition which man in his individual person stands in toward his Maker cannot be changed, by any human laws or human authority, that religious devotion, which is a part of this compact, cannot so much as be made a subject of human laws.

Does the *Truth Seeker* admit this principle? If not, it stands on substantially the same ground with the National Reformers, and the only question between them is as to the truth or falsity of the Christian religion. If conscience is not a realm that human government has no right to invade, then the majority may properly dictate to the minority in matters of religion as it does in matters of finance. But conscience *is* such a domain, and every individual has a perfect right as far as human authority is concerned to choose that religion which suits him best.C. P. B.
