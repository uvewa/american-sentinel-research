THE *Christian Advocate* has the following excellent note, upon Christianity and those who imagine that it is their mission to improve upon it:—

> Certain modern thinkers are diligently applying their minds to the task of improving Christianity. They consider it a development. According to their theory, Paul was far in advance of Isaiah, but far behind the religious teachers of this age. They believe that every thinker adds some new ideas and elements to the accumulating truth. And now they have set themselves to find some crudity of Christian doctrine which they may cut off, and some new phase of Christian thought never published before. Instead of searching for the truth in Christianity, they are searching for it in their own brain and proposing to add to the Christian system something new. Some things cannot be improved by any manipulation or thinking of ours. They are the same yesterday, to-day, and forever. The atmosphere cannot be improved. The glory of sunlight cannot be increased. It is ours to let it into our dwellings and use it. The light that shines from the gospel can never be made fuller and brighter and clearer than it is now.

It gives a light to every age;

It gives, but borrows none.

The people thus described by the *Advocate* must be pretty closely related to the National Reformers, who propose, not indeed to improve upon original Christianity, but to improve upon the Saviour's method of evangelization. Christ commissioned his people to preach the gospel in all nations, and assured them that by that means a people should be gathered out and saved; but the National Reformers regarding that method as too slow for this age of railroads and telegraph, propose to convert whole States and nations by legislative enactment and constitutional amendments, and thus not gather out a few comparatively who shall be saved, but entire peoples. Surely they are controlled by the same master-mind that inspires [347] the efforts of the reformers who want "to add to the Christian system something new."
