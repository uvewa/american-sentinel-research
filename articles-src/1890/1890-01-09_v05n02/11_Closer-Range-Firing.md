THE *Christian Nation* notices the removal of the AMERICAN SENTINEL to this city, and remarks that "the firing will now be at closer range." Possible the *Nation *will now be able to shoot a little closer to the mark. Hitherto its failures to hit anything have been unparalleled by any journal with which we are acquainted, with the possible exception of the *Christian Statesman.*
