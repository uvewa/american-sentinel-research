# An Excellent Thought.

The *Christian Advocate* of this city, has the following item which contains an excellent thought which those who want Congress and our several State Legislatures to remove by legislation all the difficulties in the way of church work would do well to consider. The *Advocate* says:—

> An attempt is sometimes made to explain the slow progress of religion in our large cities on the ground that the conditions of society are peculiarly unfavorable to evangelical Christianity. We are told that many of the inhabitants are German infidels and atheists, Italian and Irish Catholics, Jews and pagans, and that these are not easily reached by the gospel, and therefore aggressive movements are not to be expected. Certainly these elements are antagonistic to Protestant Christianity, and present serious obstacles in the way of its progress; but did the gospel ever yet find a field which was free from antagonistic elements? Has the gospel any other aim than to meet and overcome hostile forces and reduce a world of enemies to subjection? Human nature is one the world over, and the gos pel is perfectly adapted to the work of saving men without respect to class or nationality. Wisdom to wield the sword of the Spirit is all that is wanting, and this wisdom cometh down from above.

If in harmony with this suggestion, the churches would pay more attention to wielding the “sword of the Spirit” and a little less to invoking the aid of the State, much good might reasonably be expected to result, not only to sinners but to the Church itself. [23]

A WRITER in a religions contemporary says that Italy is a hard soil for the growth of Protestantism. On the one hand are the Romanists, upon whom no impression can be made, and upon the other the Infidels, upon whom still less impression is possible. Unbelief among the Italian men, he says, is general in Rome, and their absence from Church is conspicuous.

This state of affairs is not to be wondered at since it is the legitimate result of the Church and State *regime* which has so long cursed Italy. Men may be compelled to observe the outward forms of religion, but that does not make them truly pious, and when the compulsion is removed they will surely go farther in the other direction than though they had not been coerced. Coercion in religion breeds hatred, and hatred is the very opposite of Christianity.

A RELIGIOUS paper has the following, which we pass along for the benefit of our religion-by-law friends:—

“The foolishness of legislating on Bible doctrines should be discovered by the comments which such work calls forth from the average newspaper. The following is a case in point. The Presbytery of Cincinnati having voted that all infants dying in infancy are saved, the Cincinnati *Inquirer* of Nov. 20, 1889, comments upon the action as follows:—

> “By a vote of twenty-two to eighteen, the Presbytery of Cincinnati concluded that “all infants dying in infancy are saved.” Bless their dear little hearts, how they must rejoice at this declaration! But let them pause a moment and reflect upon the solemn fact that a change of only three votes would have damned them forever.”

THE *Christian Advocate* of this city says:—

That idleness is a prolific cause of vice and crime is made clear by facts constantly coming under the observation of those who read the papers and study the condition of society.

This is true, and being true is it not a little strange that so many of those who know that it is true are in favor of laws compelling people to be idle one day each week. There can be no doubt that Sabbath keeping is a good thing; but habitual idleness one day each week is not Sabbathkeeping; only those keep a Sabbath, in any proper sense of the word, who observe the day unto the Lord. The *Advocate* is right, “idleness is a prolific cause of vice,” and therefore all laws that foster idleness foster vice. [24]

OWING to a lack of funds the “publication of documents of the American Sabbath Union for 1890” has been postponed.

THE field secretary of the American Sabbath Union announces that he will make another lecture trip across the continent and back, starting across in April and reaching the Atlantic again in August. Definite dates and places of giving the lectures, are not yet announced.

THE local Sunday bill for the District of Columbia was presented in the House of Representatives by Representative Breckinridge, of Kentucky. The Speaker referred it to the Committee on Education and Labor, but by request it was afterward referred to the Committee on the District of Columbia. We hope to have a copy of the bill for comment in our next issue.

WE have received a circular from the secretary of the American Sabbath Union, announcing that the Union is to hold a convention at Washington, D. C., January 30 and 31. “Everybody” is invited, but “especially the friends of the American Civil Sabbath in Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia.” “The leading purpose of the convention” as announced “is to urge upon Congress the request of the commissioners of the District of Columbia” for a Sunday law. The circular announces that “distinguished Senators, Congressmen, pastors and others are expected to speak” besides Mr. Crafts.

COLONEL SHEPARD of the so-called Sabbath Union, is making himself ridiculous and bringing religion, which he is supposed to represent, into contempt by such utterances as the following which is attributed to him in a speech before the recent Dominion Evangelical Alliance:—

> The West Shore and Hudson River Railways, which were started for the purpose of running Sunday excursions, were driven into bankruptcy by the Lord. A new management cut off the Sunday traffic as far as possible, and now their finances are in good condition. At one time no Sunday elevated trains were run on the Sabbath, when it was arranged that a train should be asked for by a Christian minister, who, by the way, very soon was called away from earth.

It may do to talk this sort of stuff to people who do not know the facts in the case, but it will not impress others very much. The truth is that the West Shore Railroad was driven into bankruptcy by a most ruinous competition. Then it passed under the management of the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad. The rates were increased and the number of trains reduced, and the Vanderbilts make money out of it. *And Sunday trains both freight and passenger are run,* and have been all the time, both on the West Shore and the New York Central.

IT is stated that the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland has issued a pastoral address on non-church-going and its causes, which it asks to be read over the pulpits in all the churches on a convenient Sabbath. It points out that in Glasgow, the most populous city of Scotland, there are not fewer than one hundred and twenty thousand persons who are alienated from public worship. It is further remarked that there is a similar and alarming proportion of people in other towns, and even in rural parishes, who habitually absent themselves from church.

It may be interesting to remember in this connection that Scotland is probably the most strict Sunday observing country in the world; but it seems that something more than simply refraining from work on Sunday is required to make people pious, or even to insure their attendance at church. Evidently that which Scotland needs (?) is a law requiring everybody to attend church who is not excused for some good and sufficient reason. The National Reformers should see what can be done for the country of the Covenanters.

We should like for some of the people who favor the suppression of base ball on Sunday, to point out what there is about a base-ball game that is uncivil on Sunday any more than on any other day. No one pretends that the playing of a game of base-ball is uncivil in any sense. It cannot be shown that it is in any way uncivil on Sunday, and it is not because of any incivility in it that they propose to suppress it on Sunday. Nor is this all; the playing of base-ball is not even irreligious. It is true that men who are not religious play base-ball. It is equally true that men who are religious, and strictly so, can play base-ball and still be religious. Then it is not because the playing of base-ball is either uncivil or irreligious that they propose to suppress it on Sunday; it is solely because Sunday is held by certain people to be a religious day, and that it is to be devoted to religious exercises; and as the playing of base-ball is not a religious exercise, therefore it is not consistent with the religious observance of a day. Consequently the only purpose of the enactment and enforcement of Sunday laws is to enforce the observance of it as a religious day. It is to compel people who are not religious to pay religious tribute to those who pretend to be religious. But if the Government is to do this in one thing when it is demanded, why not in everything else as it may be demanded, and have a thorough-going union of Church and State at once. That will be the outcome of a national Sunday law.

THERE was lately organized, in the City of New York, a league professedly to maintain American institutions. We have not yet seen a copy of its constitution or any official statement of its objects, but from what we can gather from the newspaper report, it seems to be more than anything else an organization to maintain American Protestant institutions as against Catholic institutions. Like most of the attempts in this line, that have lately been made, this looks too much like an attempt to put Protestantism in the place of legal recognition rather than Catholicism, and no American institution can ever be defended by any such means as that. Protestantism as an established religion, is only the Papacy in principle and under another name. We shall give our readers more particulars in this matter hereafter.

“ONE of the most prominent characteristics of the American Sabbath Union, says its organ, the *Pearl of Days,* is its broad basis of practical Christian union for one national, civil, and religious object. Its only ‘ shibbotleth ’ is the preservation of ‘the Christian Sabbath as a day of rest and worship.’ It has no ‘sibboleths’ no other motto upon its banner. For this supreme end Protestants and Roman Catholics can and do co-operate, even if they are not incorporated in the institution itself. Religion and patriotism combine together to keep and to hand down to succeeding generations the blessing of ‘the Lord’s Day.’

Certainly the object of the so-called union is “civil and religious;” it is civil in that it demands that the civil power enforce a religious institution; and it is religious in that the great underlying motive of the leaders in the “union” is the exaltation of Sunday because of the sacredness which in their minds attaches to that particular day. The term “civil” which they use is simply sugar used to catch flies that might not relish the odor of Church and State vinegar. [25]
