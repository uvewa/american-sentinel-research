[This article which is an abridgement of a sermon on "The Province of Law in Distinction from that of Truth" is from a discourse delivered by Rev. Benjamine F. Clark before the Executive and Legislative Department of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, upon the occasion of the meeting of the Legislature of that State in 1869. It is equally well adapted to the national Legislature and to questions now before that body.]

Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: As agents of the public in this commonwealth, you are called to fill honorable positions and to perform important work. In the capacity of legislators, it is highly important that you have clear and correct views respecting the province of law, that you may avoid the mistakes of others, and make your own legislation effective for good.

Among our citizens there are those who seem to think that most of "the ills that flesh is heir to" can be removed by legislation. These ask for impracticable laws, in conflict with well-established principles in political economy and in human nature. They demand legislation which will regulate the habits of the people. They demand legislation which shall force others to adopt their views and practices, and shall bring them into conformity to their standard of right. By this class of reformers, who are laboring to renovate the world by legislation, you will be approached, as your predecessors have been, with earnest petitions to frame their impracticable views into legal enactments. These impracticable men and women may urge you to pass laws to effect ends which are not within the province of legislation.

In the capacity of legislators, you will find it profitable to keep this province distinctly in view; bearing in mind that, while in a despotic government the habits of the people can be regulated by law, backed by military force, in a free government, like ours, having a sovereign in each of its subjects, this cannot be done. A despot may decide by law, which is the mere expression of his own will, what his subjects shall eat, drink and wear, and how they may talk and act; but such legislation in a republic will always prove a failure and a disaster. Understand, that the law is good if men use it lawfully; if they employ it in a sphere to which it is adapted, and for an end it was designed to accomplish. Guard against the fallacious reasonings of men who demand of law what law, in its weakness, cannot do.

If asked to remove acknowledged moral evils and to effect desired moral improvements by legal enactments, refuse compliance, saying to your petitioners, It is impossible to legislate men into holiness, to force them to cultivate the Christian graces, or even to practice the common virtues. These ends must be effected, if at all, by the potent agency of truth kindly applied to the rational in man. Christ and his apostles, and their immediate successors in the Christian Church, never invoked the aid of law in their reformatory work. They were content to use the truth in their endeavors to reform men; but when the church became corrupt, its members, like some modern reformers, became self-righteous, belligerent, cruel, denying the right to think, much less to speak, in opposition to their standards.

The men trained by the great Teacher were model reformers, and eminently successful in their work. They wrought wonderful changes in the views and habits of the people whom they converted to the belief and practice of Christianity. They erected the standard of the cross, and made it attractive. Multitudes of Jews and Gentiles were effectually drawn to it by the magnetic power of the truth it contained. In proportion as persons, professedly desiring to improve human society, have imitated these model reformers, in spirit and in action, have they been successful.

What is the condition of the temperance reformation in our country to-day? Like the Christian Church, when united to the Roman State, this reformation has yielded to the embrace of politicians and been paralyzed; and the demand is felt for some bold reformer to rescue it from this polluting embrace, and bring it back into the field in which it made such great and glorious conquests, where it may make others still greater and more glorious. Temperance societies *now,* instead of being institutions for moral reform, are political organizations; and temperance lectures and temperance sermons are, in many instances, mere political harangues, which degrade the pulpit and desecrate the Sabbath.

If asked to enact laws to compel men to be virtuous, direct your petitioners to the great Reformer, and bid them imitate him. Let them be told that the law is good if men use it lawfully, in its appropriate province, which is not to reform, but to protect. Let them be told that legal protection in the use of moral means for effecting their objects is all the aid which legislation can properly afford. Let the history of the Pharisees of the Christian Church after its adoption by the Roman Emperor, of Catholic Mary, of Protestant Elizabeth, and of all other persecutors who have cruelly *compelled* persons to adopt their views and practices, influence you to resist importunate demands to frame laws for the regulation of men's habits, remembering that habits have opinions for their basis, and that opinions cannot be rationally changed by law and force. [14]

You may be asked to frame laws to make men virtuous, which may be successfully used in connection with the truth, thereby combining force with persuasion. Our subject proclaims against such legislation, declaring that force and persuasion cannot be equally yoked together, and that law, being good *only* when used lawfully, is out of its province when forcibly employed to regulate either the opinions or the habits of the people. With the Judaizing teachers in mind, you cannot consistently yield to the demand for such legislation, knowing that, constituted as men are, if they attempt to use law and force instead of truth and persuasion in the work of reform, they will rely upon the former two to the exclusion of the latter. Force and persuasion nominally combined will generally constitute *simple force* in its most objectionable form; therefore legislators should resist demands for their combination.

Intent upon employing force in the reformatory department, some of your constituents, with more zeal than knowledge, demand legislation which will afford them *indirect* aid in bringing men to the adoption of their views and practices. It is a principle of law and of morals that men cannot rightfully do indirectly what they have not a right to do directly. This kind of legislation is not only impracticable, but often exceedingly mischievous. It not only fails to accomplish its object, but not unfrequently it increases the evil it was designed to lessen.

Law has an honorable and useful province, and is efficient for good when used lawfully, in accomplishing ends for which it was designed; and efficient for evil when improperly used to force changes in the peculiar province of truth. Keep these two provinces distinctly in view, and let the view influence your legislative action. Let professed reformers in our commonwealth understand that, whether in the capacity of organized churches, or of voluntary societies, formed for specific purposes, they can only receive from you protection in their work, while, in imitation of the great Christian Reformer and those trained by him in person, they may call upon sinners to repent, and persuade the vicious to change their habits and their characters, by proclaiming the terrors of the law, and describing the excellencies of virtue.

If you yield to their demand for legal authority to compel men to adopt their standard of right and propriety, you will make them like Saul of Tarsus, self-righteous, belligerent, and cruel, who breathed out threatenings and slaughter, under such authority, in the capacity of a persecutor. Saul of Tarsus undertook to reform people by force; Paul the apostle persuaded men to abandon sin and practice the Christian virtues. Saul of Tarsus was a self-righteous, cruel Pharisee; Paul the apostle was a bright ornament of the Christian Church. Saul of Tarsus was a destructionist; Paul the apostle was a true benefactor. If you would have the reformers in our commonwealth resemble the benefactor and Christian, rather than the destructionist and Pharisee, withhold from them legislation, except in the form of protection, bearing in mind that the law is only good when used lawfully.
