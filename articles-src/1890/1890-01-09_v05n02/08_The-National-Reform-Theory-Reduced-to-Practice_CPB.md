THE National Reform doctrine as set forth by Rev. J. M. Foster, a secretary of the association, is that —

> "According to the Scriptures, the State and its sphere exist for the sake of, and to serve the interests of, the church." "The true State will have a wise reference to the church's interests in all its legislative, executive, and judicial proceedings," "The expenses of the church, in carrying on her public aggressive work, it meets in whole, or in part out of the public treasury. Thus the church is protected and exalted by the State."

This being the National Reform view, and it must be, for these are Mr. Foster's own words just as they appeared over his own name in the *Christian Cynosure,* it follows that Trinidad, the "pearl of the Antilles," is a model National Reform country. It has no established sect, but the State provides the whole church, Protestant and Catholic, "funds out of the public treasury for carrying on her public aggressive work." A correspondent of a New York paper writing from Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, British West Indies, says:—

> "Last year the government gave the Roman Catholics $13,550 and the Anglicans $5,815 for the upkeep of their respective scholastic establishments. The government also pays for four exhibitions or scholarships of $750 each per annum, tenable for three years. And boys from the Roman Catholic College of the Immaculate Conception are permitted to compete for and obtain these scholarships. In addition to this, the government contributes $5,000 a year toward the support of this Catholic college. We next find that the sum of about $17,- 500 a year is paid from the public treasury toward the maintenance of the Church of England in Trinidad, and $30,000 to the Romanists."

The same correspondent continues:—

> "And what has been the result of all this pampering by the government of the religious bodies? Has it achieved any good? I say, 'No,' emphatically. The lower classes are as ruffianly and blackguard a lot as any country was ever afflicted with. Concubinage is general, and only twenty-six per cent of the births are legitimate. Thrift is almost unknown. Prostitution and vice are rampant, especially among the younger females. Gambling in its worst form is the order of the day. Burglaries have been of late very prevalent. And yet there is not one of these people who is not an adept at making the sign of the cross, and who cannot read off "Hail Mary's" and "Pater Nosters" by the ell. The young girls, after making what is known as their first communion, lapse into dreadful profligacy."

And this is the condition of a country in which they have that which the National Reformers propose for this land, namely, to use their own term, "a union of religion and the State." But does this show that Christianity is a failure! By no means, it simply shows that which has been demonstrated in much the same way wherever it has been tried, namely, that Christianity fostered and supported by a civil government ceases to be Christianity, and loses its power either to elevate people in the moral scale or to prevent them from sinking to even greater depths of vice than that in which it finds them. Many and dark have been the crimes committed in the name of liberty, but they are no more numerous, nor of deeper dye than are the abominations practiced in the name of the religion of Him in whose mouth was found no guile, and in whose life there was no sin.C. P. B.
