# A Minister on the Situation.

THE following letter from the pastor of a Christian Church in Kirksville, Mo., will commend itself to the good sense of our readers:—

> EDITORS AMERICAN SENTINEL: I am in receipt of two copies of your most excellent paper, and have read them with care. Am in sympathy with the work to be accomplished by the publication of the AMERICAN SENTINEL, because I am convinced that any effort on the part of our law- making powers to unite Church and State would sooner or later prove a fatal blow to the welfare of this Republic.

The mission of the SENTINEL is a noble one, and a copy should be in every family, in this whole country.

It is not the province of our Government to unite Church and State, nor even to indicate in the Constitution that this is a Christian nation. If those who are so anxious to unite Church and State would take a little time to read the history of such unions, it would cool their ardor, I am sure. Those blind enthusiasts who would do such a foolish and hurtful thing, certainly exhibit a very great want of knowledge of human nature and the principles of government. The peculiar constitution of man and the character of our Government, forbid the creation of any such relation. The condition of things that obtain in the Republic of Mexico at this time, should admonish every sensible American citizen. Let the good work go on.
