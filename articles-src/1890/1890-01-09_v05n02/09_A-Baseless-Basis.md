THE second article of the American Sabbath Union declares that,—

> "The basis of this Union is the divine authority and universal and perpetual obligation of the Sabbath as manifested in the constitution of nature," &c.

The Sabbath is not manifested in the constitution of nature. The statement that it is so manifested is false, and the members of the American Sabbath Union know it to be false. Rev. Dr. Herrick Johnson, of Chicago, is a member of the American Sabbath Union, and not by any means an insignificant member. If they have any such thing as representative members, Dr. Johnson certainly may be named as one. In the Congressional Hearing, in behalf of the national Sunday law, December, 1888, held by the American Sabbath Union, Dr. Johnson was one of the speakers, and in his speech he said:—

> "This appointment of one day in seven is arbitrary. There is nothing in nature to indicate that division of time. There is the day of twenty-four hours, there is the month, there is the year, all these are natural divisions; but there is nothing in nature to indicate the weekly division—the observance of one day in seven. It is arbitrary, and we regard that as an evidence of its divine origin."

These statements of Dr. Johnson are evidently true upon their face, and they just as evidently prove that the statement, as to the basis of the American Sabbath Union, is false. The divisions of time into days, months, and years, is natural; there is that in nature that clearly defines these divisions. But there is nothing in nature to mark even the weekly division of time much less is there anything in nature that would mark one of the days in the weekly division as a day to be religiously observed. The State exists and has its basis only upon the plane of the natural. It has to do with things only upon the plane of the natural. The Sabbath is based only in the action of God and is manifested only in the revealed will of God. Both of which are pre-eminently supernatural. Therefore, the State existing only in the plane of the natural, and having to do only with the natural, can never of right have anything to do with the Sabbath, or with the weekly division of time which is caused by the Sabbath. That much of the basis of the American Sabbath Union is a fraud. And as the Sabbath Union exists for the purpose of securing religious legislation in behalf of the Sabbath, it follows that the basis of the American Sabbath Union rests upon nothing more tangible than does the "baseless fabric of a dream."
