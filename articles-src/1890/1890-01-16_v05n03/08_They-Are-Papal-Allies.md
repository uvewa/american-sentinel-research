IN commenting upon certain abominations taught by Romanists as Christianity, the *Ironclad Age* has the following which is none the less true or sensible because it was said by an infidel paper:—

> "Yet this is the religion that Popery is scheming to have taught at the public expense in our free schools. And the Protestant Church is actively assisting the Papacy in this treason. God in the Constitution, Christ as the supreme ruler, "the principles of the Christian religion" to be inculcated in the free schools—these are the battle cries alike of Popery and Protestantism. Nor does Protestantism seem to realize that if God is placed in the Constitution, it will be the papal god: if the principles of the Christian religion are to be inculcated in the public schools, it will be the principles of said religion as defined and practiced by Popery.

> "Protestantism seems blind to the signs of the times. It doesn't seem to note that the Papacy, that has impoverished and ruined all the old countries, is now cutting loose from those countries and concentrating its strength in the United States. The Papacy, united and possessed of immense wealth, is stronger politically to-day in this country than all the divisions of Protestantism in their disunited condition. Catholics by the hundreds of thousands are flocking to our shores. Their first and last allegiance is to the Pope, yet they are almost immediately on their arrival endowed with citizenship in fifteen of our States. Rome, by its consolidated vote, rules all the great cities in the United States to-day; and either of the great political parties that would dare openly to antagonize the Papacy would be snowed under out of sight in any general election in the United States if that election were to come off next week. Nothing but a unity between Protestantism and all the liberal and non-religious elements of this country will save it from the fate that has befallen every country where the papal beast of blood has been allowed to roam unrestrained. And the sooner this is understood the better for the country."
