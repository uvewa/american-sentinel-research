"ONE of the most prominent characteristics of the American Sabbath Union, says its organ, the *Pearl of Days,* is its broad basis of practical Christian union for one national, civil, and religious object. Its only ' shibbotleth ' is the preservation of 'the Christian Sabbath as a day of rest and worship.' It has no 'sibboleths' no other motto upon its banner. For this supreme end Protestants and Roman Catholics can and do co-operate, even if they are not incorporated in the institution itself. Religion and patriotism combine together to keep and to hand down to succeeding generations the blessing of 'the Lord's Day.'

Certainly the object of the so-called union is "civil and religious;" it is civil in that it demands that the civil power enforce a religious institution; and it is religious in that the great underlying motive of the leaders in the "union" is the exaltation of Sunday because of the sacredness which in their minds attaches to that particular day. The term "civil" which they use is simply sugar used to catch flies that might not relish the odor of Church and State vinegar. [25]
