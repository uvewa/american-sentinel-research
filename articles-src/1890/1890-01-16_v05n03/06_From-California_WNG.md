EDITORS AMERICAN SENTINEL: Sunday-law advocates in California may rejoice on general principles that the SENTINEL has been removed out of the State, but fortunately that class are yet a minority. There is one feature of the removal, however, that even its friends may rejoice at,—it is a forward move, and a long one too, against the efforts of the mis-named National Reform party which it is set to oppose. America, that part of it which is really American, reaches from ocean to ocean, and Californians are happy to know that your journal can remove its publication office from the Pacific to the Atlantic coast and still be American. And now that you are squarely planted in the great commercial metropolis and political center, your old-time neighbors bid you God-speed on your noble mission. When you shall have fairly warned the people of these United States of the full meaning of national Sunday laws, and religious amendments to the Constitution, and all kindred encroachments upon their liberties, your full duty in the matter will have been fulfilled, whether they heed your warning voice or not.

## Silence On The Blair Bill.

Notwithstanding Senator Blair's promptness in the introduction of the pet schemes of the National Reform Association and American Sabbath Union; and notwithstanding the text of these measures has reached us by mail in Congressional print; it is noticeable that not a word, at present writing, has appeared in the newspapers of the State. The telegraphic news entirely ignores the bills, and the leading religious journals have likewise kept silent. Whether this is a part of the program of the managers of these measures at Washington, or whether it is an indication of the small interest felt in such matters by the press, is a question which your correspondent is unable to answer. I am curiously waiting to see how long the silence will continue.

## On The Alert For Foreign Foes.

If some foreign power were to propose restriction upon our privileges as a people, though the portentous cloud should not wear a tithe of the blackness of darkness manifested in these Blair measures, there would be a "clash of resounding arms" along our coast. When Germany put on just a little swagger in presence of our august national dignity at Samoa, the Monroe doctrine suddenly let out a great tuck in its spacious garment, covering about half the Pacific Ocean, and all classes of journals,—big and little, daily and weekly, religious and secular, vied with each other in wails about our defenseless coast.

When a United States revenue cutter seized a couple of Canadian vessels engaged in poaching seals in Behring Strait, and the British lion growled but faintly, there was an imaginary invasion of our western coast in the minds of the editorial fraternity from British Columbia to Mexico, and there was a perfect deluge of military reports and newspaper demands for large appropriations for harbor and coast defenses.

## BUT.

When there arises in our midst a spirit of religious intolerance seeking to control the Government, and whose aim is to strike out of our fundamental law the very principle of civil and religious liberty upon which our nation has grown and prospered more than a century, our otherwise alert and enterprising press is mum. Although these same measures were made so prominent in the last Congress, and are thrust in so early at the present session, after persistent canvassing of the country during all the interval, yet our sagacious defenders can see no danger.

In the case of danger of foreign invasion, prevention is the cry upon the appearance of the first speck of threatened hostility; but the reply to such internal menaces often is, "Oh, if the Blair bills should pass, the people would rise in armed resistance to their enforcement." Such is the dependence of many who are opposed to the principles of religious legislation in general. But why not be as precautions concerning the far greater evil, as they are suspicious of the lesser possibility? Organizations in every State in the Union comprising prominent men of every shade of politics and religion, and national organizations of great influence, besides the prestige of like enactments in nearly all the States, merely waiting Congressional action in order to give full force to their intolerant provisions, present a massive front too ominous to be ignored. Ignorance of what such measures mean, in the light of popular history, is impossible on the part of any man who aspires to the rank of enlightened journalism. [21]

Is it possible that the publishers of our great newspapers, as well as our great politicians, who are recognized as leaders in national policy and national thought, are so lost to the interests of the country as to lie dormant in regard to such issues? Can it be that these National Reform measures, championed in Congress by Senator Blair, will be allowed to go by default? Or that having been tacitly encouraged by silence on the part of opponents, they may attain such a degree of apparent popularity that the press and the politicians will feel constrained, if not to openly advocate, at least to offer no opposition? It looks as though such would be the case. And indeed leaders in the movement have expressed hope for success from this very cause. We shall soon see if they have prophesied aright.

W. N. GLENN.
