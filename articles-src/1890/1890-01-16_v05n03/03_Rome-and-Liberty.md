# Rome and Liberty.

THIS article which we clip from *Present Truth,* a religious paper published in London, shows that even in England the contest now being waged in this country between the principles of Protestantism and the principles of the Papacy, is being watched with no little interest. The fact is also recognized that the principles of the so-called National Reform Association are the principles of Rome. *Present Truth *says

In an Encyclical published a few years ago, the Pope said, “All Catholics should do all in their power to cause the Constitutions of States, and legislation, to be modeled on the principles of the true church. All Catholic writers and journalists. should never lose, for an instant, from view the above prescriptions.” It has been urged officially that this should be specially kept in mind in England and the United States. The activity of Catholics, *as Romanists,* in the field of politics and journalism in England, is a constant reminder that the advice is being acted upon.

The recent Catholic Congress in America has drawn attention again to the work of Rome in the United States. A suspicious feature of the conference was the repeated and vociferous protestation of loyalty to free institutions. Those who are loyal at heart are content to let their lives and work show it, and do not find it necessary to multiply honeyed words. It was not many years ago that a papal encyclical anathematized “those who assert the liberty of conscience and of religious worship.” Speaking of the present position of the controversy in America—and we can see there more fully developed, perhaps, the forces which are at work [28] in this country—the *Christian Commonwealth* says:—

> From across the Atlantic come many ominous warnings of a great struggle soon to come. The great Republic is awaking to the prospect of a battle which can in no way be decided, for it is simply a fact of inevitable destiny that the people of America must pass through a conflict with Rome. Rome! Name of unspeakable portent! The very word calls up a whole panorama of lurid apocalyptic visions. For ages the wave of human energy has rolled westward. And in our day the battle-field where the crowning struggle of liberty is to be fought seems likely to be found in the Western Hemisphere.

But the *Commonwealth* draws inspiration from a recently published work showing the “increase of Protestantism and the decline of Popery.” It says:—

> The Protestant peoples are rapidly tending to outnumber the Romish, and this single fact entirely settles the future outlook. As to America, when the Puritan element there is really roused the ambitious and dogmatic Romanism which is seeking to seat itself in a dominant attitude over the grand new prerogative of nations—liberty for all consciences—will quickly be convinced that it is in the minority and must never hope to emerge from such a position.

This faith as to the increase of Protestantism, is based on figures showing the increase of nominally Protestant people. But we do not forget the words of an eminent European who said, “Protestants there are, but Protestantism is dead;” nor the words of the late Dr. Prochnow, “The land of Luther needs again the spirit of Luther;” nor the very recent remarks of Mr. J. A. Fronde, “That magnificent intellectual Protestantism is forever dead. The spirit that inspired Cromwell and William of Orange, oh! that spirit has altogether died out.” Were this not the truth, the children of the Reformation would do the works of the Reformation.

Even the “Puritan element” which is expected to become roused in America, has been fawning upon Romanism and begging its co-operation in a powerful movement which is designed to amend a Constitution how guaranteeing freedom of conscience to all, so that it shall be what is called a “Christian Constitution,” which “would disfranchise every logically consistent infidel,” along with whom, it is declared, the Christian observers of the seventh-day Sabbath, and the Jews would have to be placed. To effect this revolution, the aid of the Romanists is necessary, and some time ago an article in the organ of this “reforming” movement, the *Christian Statesman* said, that although they might expect some rebuffs at first, the time had come “to make repeated advances, and gladly to accept co-operation in any form in which they may be willing to exhibit it.” The same programme anticipates the introduction of religious instruction into the public schools. The late Catholic Congress, as might be expected, has declared in favor of both national religious legislation and religious instruction in the schools. Of course the religion Rome will favor, is what she calls the “true religion.” And when the tiger is unchained by the removal of those Constitutional barriers which have placed matters religious where the religion of Christ places, them, outside the jurisdiction of civil government, it will need no prophet to foresee the result. We will let the *Christian Commonwealth *state it:—

> The 8,000,000 of Papists in the United States are being drilled day and night to demand supremacy over the civil power in the all-important department of public education. Should the people of the United States yield the control of the schools to the Romish hierarchy, the death-knell of popular liberty would be rung.
