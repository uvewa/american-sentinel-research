# That Sunday-law Tour.

LAST week we had space merely to notice the fact that Mr. Crafts of the American Sabbath Union, intends to make another tour across the continent and back in the interests of a national Sunday law. He announced that those who desire addresses from him “should send early invitations, stating what months and what days of the week are first, second, and third choice. When lectures can be put at dates that will chime with other dates in the same region,” the terms are: “A guarantee of at least $15 for a week-night or afternoon; $20 for a convention, afternoon and evening; and $30 for a Sunday.” “Local entertainment to be provided” in every case. Three services may be held on Sunday for the thirty dollars; but it is thirty dollars whether there be one service or three.

Where there are three meetings on Sunday, no engagement will be made for Sunday morning “where the church will not either appropriate $10 or more” “or give the collection.” Sunday afternoon meeting is expected to be “in some hall, opera house, or pavilion, and whatever is taken in the collection beyond expenses of rent and advertising” is to go to the cause. Sunday evening meeting is expected to be a union of “at least several churches,” and the entire collection is to be devoted “to the work.”

It is to be “understood that those sending invitations” for Sunday speeches do “guarantee $30 as a minimum;” and whatever is raised more than thirty dollars, goes to him anyhow, which, he says, is “for Sabbath-reform literature” which is “unspeakably needed in large quantities to checkmate the literature against the American Sabbath which is being circulated vastly more than our own in all parts of the land.” Whenever the collection falls short of the full amount of the guarantee, it must be made Up “on the spot.” And, “the collection should be taken immediately after the address in all cases, and *at once counted,* so that, if it is insufficient, the balance may be secured before dismission.” The gentleman does not propose to risk even a cent’s worth, for a minute.

The “entertainment” for the tourist must also “be engaged in advance at a hotel or a home, and information sent some days before arrival as it is not always possible, even when intended, to meet the speaker at the depot, and it is very embarrassing to drive about town in a hack to get this information.” From our observation, we had not supposed that Mr. Crafts was so easily embarrassed as this would imply; because to most people it certainly is not a “very embarrassing” thing to find a hotel in any town in this country where there is a hotel; except, of course, as in such a case as this, where a man doesn’t want to pay his own expenses and wants everything cash down “on the spot.” As further particulars are learned of the proposed tour we shall announce them.A.
