A RELIGIOUS paper has the following, which we pass along for the benefit of our religion-by-law friends:—

"The foolishness of legislating on Bible doctrines should be discovered by the comments which such work calls forth from the average newspaper. The following is a case in point. The Presbytery of Cincinnati having voted that all infants dying in infancy are saved, the Cincinnati *Inquirer* of Nov. 20, 1889, comments upon the action as follows:—

> "By a vote of twenty-two to eighteen, the Presbytery of Cincinnati concluded that "all infants dying in infancy are saved." Bless their dear little hearts, how they must rejoice at this declaration! But let them pause a moment and reflect upon the solemn fact that a change of only three votes would have damned them forever."
