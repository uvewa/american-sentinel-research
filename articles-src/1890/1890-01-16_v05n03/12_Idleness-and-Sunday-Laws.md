THE *Christian Advocate* of this city says:—

That idleness is a prolific cause of vice and crime is made clear by facts constantly coming under the observation of those who read the papers and study the condition of society.

This is true, and being true is it not a little strange that so many of those who know that it is true are in favor of laws compelling people to be idle one day each week. There can be no doubt that Sabbath keeping is a good thing; but habitual idleness one day each week is not Sabbathkeeping; only those keep a Sabbath, in any proper sense of the word, who observe the day unto the Lord. The *Advocate* is right, "idleness is a prolific cause of vice," and therefore all laws that foster idleness foster vice. [24]
