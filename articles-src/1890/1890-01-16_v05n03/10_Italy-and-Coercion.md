A WRITER in a religions contemporary says that Italy is a hard soil for the growth of Protestantism. On the one hand are the Romanists, upon whom no impression can be made, and upon the other the Infidels, upon whom still less impression is possible. Unbelief among the Italian men, he says, is general in Rome, and their absence from Church is conspicuous.

This state of affairs is not to be wondered at since it is the legitimate result of the Church and State *regime* which has so long cursed Italy. Men may be compelled to observe the outward forms of religion, but that does not make them truly pious, and when the compulsion is removed they will surely go farther in the other direction than though they had not been coerced. Coercion in religion breeds hatred, and hatred is the very opposite of Christianity.
