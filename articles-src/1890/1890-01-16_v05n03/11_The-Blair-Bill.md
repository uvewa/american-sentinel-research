# The Blair Bill.

RELIGIOUS questions are not ordinarily proper subjects of political criticism and discussion, but when embodied in bills and resolutions and introduced into Congress they become political issues that must be met, discussed and decided upon their political merits.

Such measures as the “Sunday Rest Bill,” and “Religious Amendment,” introduced by Senator Blair in the 50th Congress, and recently re-introduced by him in the present session, drag these religious questions from the domain of theological discussion, where they belong, and thrust them into the arena of politics, where they must be subjected to the criticism, discussion and settlement of political questions. These issues are forced upon the people of the United States by a direct attack upon the fundamental principles of free government. Our Constitution recognizes the absolute equality of all its citizens; equality, not in physical development, mental acumen, nor social standing, but in their rights. Our Government as the conservator of the rights of all its citizens, guarantees to its humblest citizen, and to the weakest minority, all the rights accorded to its most prominent citizens and largest majorities.

No partiality is admissible. Wealth, numbers, physical perfection and social prominence are alike denied standing room upon the scales of justice, and absolute equality of rights is made the bed-rock of all our free institutions.

In recognition of the inherent and indefeasible right of every citizen to be protected in the independent exercise and free expression of his religious convictions, our Constitution wisely withholds from Congress the power to legislate upon religious subjects, and only restrains the liberty of the individual when he seeks to invade the rights of others. The success of the Blair measures involves the subversion of these principles and the removal of the constitutional barrier that now protects the weak from oppression by the strong.

The full text of these proposed measures should be published broadcast and all the avenues of intelligent expression opened wide for their full and free discussion. *—Ira D. Blanchard, in Polk County (Minn.) Journal. *[32]

THE American Sabbath Union officially makes the following announcement of what it wants, and it is this:—

> What we want in this matter of Sunday work is total abstinence.

MR. CRAFTS reports that he found a conference of ministers in New England that declined to indorse the petition to Congress for a national Sunday law. Good! May such conferences increase in number daily.

THE secretary of Publications and Legislation of the American Sabbath Union, has issued a circular in which he says: “Some churches have appropriated a hundred dollars for the prevention of heathenizing America by Sabbath reform.” Well, the AMERICAN SENTINEL appropriates more than twice that amount every week, for the prevention of the heathenizing of America by such Sabbath reform as is represented by the American Sabbath Union. We know of one church that appropriates yet more than this for the same purpose. And let the good work go on.

A lady writes thus from Rockport, Atchison County, Mo.:—

EDITORS AMERICAN SENTINEL: One of your papers came to me a few days ago. I must say I like the spirit of freedom it breathes, for I see you not only wish to preserve the rights and liberties of the minority of Christians, but the free government our fathers bequeathed to us baptized in their own blood. I should consider myself unworthy of a free government or the right to worship God according to the dictates of conscience except I am willing to grant to all, both great and small, the right to worship how, where, and what they please.

THE American Sabbath Union says that its work for Sunday laws is “a real home missionary cause” “of like importance with the Christianizing of heathen lands.” But the American Sabbath Union is attempting to do its work by legislation, especially national legislation, therefore the American Sabbath Union in asking State support thereby asks the State to take part in a missionary enterprise and do a missionary work of like importance with the Christianizing of heathen lands. This argues that the Government of the United States is a missionary society. The work of Christianizing heathen lands was committed by Jesus Christ to his disciples and not to the Roman Empire; to his Church and not to the State; and never since that has he committed that work, nor any part of it, to the State. It is committed, and belongs, to the Church only. If the Church cannot do that work without the help of the State, she cannot do it at all. Therefore the American Sabbath Union, in asking for Sunday laws asks the State to aid the Church. It asks for a union of Church and State in the work of “Christianizing” the people. Deny it as they may, the evil that is in this Sanday-law movement will crop out, unconsciously though it be. Let everybody understand that the Government of the United States is not a missionary society; but that the American Sabbath Union proposes to make it such a thing.

THE American Secular Union makes the following announcement:—

> The American Secular Union, a voluntary association having for its object the complete separation of Church and State, in practice as well as in profession, and in no way committed to any system of religious belief or disbelief, acting herein by its President, Richard B. Westbrook, A. M., LL.D., as its special trustee and attorney-in-fact, hereby offer a premium of one thousand dollars ($1,000), lawful money of the United States, for the best essay, treatise, or manual adapted to aid and assist teachers in our *free public schools* and in the *Girard College* for orphans, and other public and charitable institutions professing to be unsectarian, to thoroughly instruct children and youth in the *purest principles of morality* without inculcating *religious doctrines.*

The papers should all be submitted by April 1, 1890, though more time will be granted if necessary, and the committee is now ready to receive manuscripts. Each manuscript is desired to be in typewriting, or, if written with the hand, must be very clearly written. It should have a special mark or designation, while the real name and post-office address of the author should be sent separately, in a sealed envelope bearing the same mark as the manuscript. Both manuscript and envelope to be addressed to R. B. Westbrook, No. 1707 Oxford St., Philadelphia, Pa., postage or express prepaid.

THE Ridgewood Amusement Company of Queens County, N. Y., leased their grounds for playing base-ball and the clubs played on Sunday. The grand jury indicted the company for maintaining a nuisance in allowing Sunday base-ball. The company made no denial of letting the grounds nor of letting them for the purpose of playing base-ball, nor that baseball was played there on Sunday. The company denied that it was a nuisance and brought many citizens and some officials, all residents, who testified that it was not a nuisance. Of course, the prosecution failed to convict. The American Sabbath Union is considerably annoyed at this, and says, “Every lawyer knows that it is a much more difficult matter to convict for maintaining a nuisance than it is to convict for Sabbath-breaking. The indictment should have been for Sabbath-breaking.” But Sabbath-breaking is distinctly an offense against God. It is essentially a religious offense and no man is responsible to any soul on this earth for Sabbath breaking; and when the power of the State is employed to deal with the offense of Sabbath breaking that power is carried entirely beyond every limit that properly pertains to the jurisdiction of civil government.

A CORRESPONDENT of the *Central New Jersey Times* says in a recent communication to that paper:—

> Rome does not know what liberty of soul, body or conscience is, and she never has since she claimed temporal power. Catholics, however, have rights that should be respected, and it must be a source of regret that efforts, resolutions, and discussions, even of some religious bodies, have savored of compulsion and of legislation against Catholics. That is all wrong. If a Protestant majority can legislate against Catholics, a Catholic majority have just as good right to legislate against Protestants, and as a Baptist I want Catholics to have just the same rights and privileges as myself.

Certainly Catholics have just the same rights that Protestants have, and those rights should be respected. And when Protestants forget this and seek to invade the rights of the Catholic minority they cease to be Protestants, for not all Papists are in the Papal Church. The Protestant principle is that so far as his fellow-men are concerned every man shall be left perfectly free in matters of religion, and only those who act upon this principle are entitled to the Protestant name.

OPPOSITION without being able to show a reason for it is the position of the San Francisco *Chronicle* on the Australian ballot system. The truth is that the Jesuit organ is opposed to this method of voting because the Catholic Church is opposed to it. The system was designed for the purpose of defeating the influence of the priest in politics. In Australia the Papal Church wielded such a powerful influence over voters on election day that the people were compelled in self-defense to devise a means that would defeat the manipulations of the priests on election day. What is known as the Australian system of voting was the means adopted, and it has served the purpose so well that in Australia the priest no longer wields a power at the polls. The *Chronicle* will not acknowledge why it opposes the system.—*American Standard.* [33]
