# For the Public Health.

THE organ of the American Sabbath Union tells of a cigar dealer in Philadelphia who is in favor of Sunday closing of cigar stands, and attributes to him this language:—

> To work every day is an overtax on nature, which is sure to be followed by bad health, disease, and incapacity for any work at all. There is no necessity for the cigar stores keeping open on Sunday. Cigars are not a necessity, and hence come under the provisions of the law of 1794. I do not think the general closing of the stores on Sunday would effect the sale of cigars or diminish the receipts. The cigars which are now sold on Sunday would then be sold on Saturday or Monday. The plan if adopted would result to the mutual benefit of employee and employer alike. I do not take the stand from a religious standpoint, but with a desire to improve the general health of those who now work every day.

There are two or three points in this worthy of notice. First, there is the assumption that to work every day is to overtax nature. This may be true to some extent, but must the law interpose to prevent everybody from thus overtaxing nature? And if so, why confine this governmental interposition for the good of the people to any one day of the week? If to work more than eight or ten hours per day is to overtax nature, why should not the State require all cigar stands to close at 6 P. M. instead of at the late hour at which they do close? And the same with all other branches of business.

Again, according to the best medical authorities, smoking is a very injurious habit. Nicotine, the poison of tobacco, is one of the most deadly poisons known, and many deaths result every year from its baleful effects. There is absolutely no necessity for smoking; therefore, the State should forbid it on sanitary grounds. Would the Pennsylvania cigar dealer admit this? Certainly not, for it would ruin his business which he thinks would not be effected by Sunday closing. It seems highly probable that this philanthropic dealer in a deadly narcotic is not altogether uninfluenced in his desire for Sunday closing of cigar stands by the fact that if nobody sold cigars on Sunday it would decrease the amount which he pays for clerk hire without making a corresponding reduction in his profits. The idea of a cigar dealer being so much concerned about the public health is too utterly absurd to be amusing.C. P. BOLLMAN.
