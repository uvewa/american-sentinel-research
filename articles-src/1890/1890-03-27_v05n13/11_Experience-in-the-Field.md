# Experience in the Field.

W. C. WALSTON, of Vermont, writes, in the *Review and Herald: *“My work consists in circulating the petition, circulating subscriptions for the AMERICAN SENTINEL, selling Civil Government and Religion, and the National Sunday Law, and circulating other literature in opposition to religious legislation. I have a variety of experiences, as I meet persons of different minds and views; but it is most astonishing how few there are, who are informed in regard to the Blair bills. * * *

“The first field I canvassed was my old home town. I took nearly every leading person’s subscription for the SENTINEL, and sold several copies of Civil Government and Religion. I have sold this pamphlet to every clergyman I have visited, with one exception, and to nearly every lawyer. I first visited a man of large influence, who said his attention had not been called particularly to the Blair bills, and he should want to consider the matter fully, before making any move. I left him Civil Government and Religion, and the National Sunday Law to read, and again visited him. He received me cordially, and stated that he had read them with interest and profit. He said he was himself opposed to all forms of State religion, and should be strongly opposed to the Blair bills. He also said he corresponded with one of our State Senators, and would write him his views in regard to the bills in full.

“I realize that this is an important work, and it needs much wisdom and the help of God, to conduct it aright.”

Such an expression of their experience, and the result of their work, as this, is desired by the Secretary of the Association, from the workers throughout the field generally.

WHILE the Blair Sunday-observance bill now before Congress is drawing the attention of church people that way, the Legislature of South Dakota is kicking up a rumpus with the prohibition bill it is considering. The objectionable feature of the latter bill is that it prohibits the use of fermented wine for sacramental purposes. The writer is one of a large class that believes that the Bible does not require that fermented wine be used at the communion table. We understand, however, that the rules of the Catholic Church require fermented wine, and the clergymen of the Episcopal Church are divided on the subject. This being the case, it seems as though the bill if passed, would be declared unconstitutional, on the ground that it interfered “with the religious rights and privileges of the Church and individual.” These words were taken from an interview of Bishop M. N. Gilbert, of the Episcopal Church, a pronounced temperance man. It seems to us that the Dakota prohibitionists are carrying things too far. Every temperance man, with the exception of extremists, is satisfied to confine his opposition to the liquor business to the *abuse* of liquor, and does not care to interfere with its *legitimate use.* So long as the use of fermented wine for sacramental purposes is at least an open question, it does not seem like quite the proper thing to decide with such positiveness. When the abuses of liquor are among the things of the past, it will be time enough to so regulate its use.— *Litchfield, Minnesota, Review.*

THE friends of liberty must not for one moment forget that the advocates of National Sunday legislation are working night and day to secure the enactment of the Blair Sunday-rest bill. This bill is really in the interest of the Church and of the Church only, but the crafty schemers engineering it have done all they could to deceive the people into the belief that its object is “to secure to the people the privileges of rest and of religious worship” on Sunday, “free from disturbance by others,” just as though existing laws did not guarantee this freedom from disturbance on all days of the week! Beware of the Protestant Jesuits!—*Fair Play. *[95-96]

FOR a living illustration of the influence of ecclesiastics in legislation, please read and inwardly digest the article by our London correspondent, page 91.

A NEW edition of the pamphlet “Civil Government and Religion” is now ready. It contains the new Amendment resolution and the new National Sunday bill, with discussions of them which brings the pamphlet up to date. Let it have the widest possible circulation.

THERE was laid on our table this week a copy of a German edition, illustrated, of the pamphlet “Civil Government and Religion.” We are glad to see it. It supplies a need that has been seriously felt for some time. We hope the friends of truth and good government will bring this to the notice of the German people as promptly and as widely as possible. 229 pages. Price, 35 cents.

SUNDAY evening, March 9, there was a Sunday-law meeting held in Bedford Street Methodist Episcopal Church, this city, Colonel Elliott F. Shepard was one of the speakers, and his speech was characteristic of himself and of the body of which he is president, as the following extract will show. This is all of his speech that needs to be reported:—

> England and the United States are the greatest Nations in the world because they keep the fourth commandment. Germany conquered France because she was a better Sabbath-keeping Nation, and by this standard a Nation’s greatness may be judged.

AT the annual meeting of the alumni and alumne of Michigan University, resident in Washington, which was recently held at Willard’s, Representative Allen, of Michigan, made a ringing after-dinner speech. He declared that the University owed much of the marvelous progress which it has made to the fact that it has always maintained the proper distinctions between religion and the State.

This great institution of learning has kept an even course, in respect to these questions, through much adverse criticism. But, by the character of the men whom it has sent out to participate in the public councils of the States and of the Nation, it has proved most conclusively that a noble and intelligent Christianity can be developed without a distinctive theological training. It is a fact that, in these days of increasing subserviency to man-made theology, and of dangerous tendency to centralization in Church and in State, with a view to future coalition, the broadly educated men and women of such institutions as the Michigan University are needed to maintain the social, political, and moral equilibrium of national affairs.

THE annual Convention of the National Reform Association is to meet in Lincoln Music Hall, Washington City, April 1, and continue three days. Rev. Jonathan Edwards is announced as one of the speakers, and he is to speak on the same subject that he did in the Convention of 1873. Hon. W. C. P. Breckinridge, who framed the Sunday bill for the District of Columbia is to preside at one of the sessions and make a speech.

Of all days in the year, the first day of April is the only one on which that Association can with perfect consistency meet.

IN a speech in the United States Senate, March 5, in opposition to the Blair Educational bill, Senator Plumb, of Kansas, gave expression to an immense truth, and as important just now as it is immense, when he spoke the two following sentences:—

> Whatever domain Government invades it domi nates. The jurisdiction which it takes it keeps.

Let the people attach these two sentences to the Sunday Bills that are now before Congress, then carefully study the whole, and they will get a view of what the result would be if they became laws. By this too, those who favor these measures can see what they ask when they petition for the passage of such bills

IN the United States Senate March 3, Senator Spooner, of Wisconsin, very justly remarked that “the tendency of this day is too much to paternalism in government.” This is too true. The evil tendency seems to be in the very air. It crops out here and there and everywhere. It cannot be too carefully watched nor too strictly guarded against. Mr. Spooner further said that “no man can sit in Congress without being conscious of the fact that very often petitions come here for legislation on topics which are not justly the subject of legislation.” Sunday legislation is a sample of this, therefore let the petitions be rolled up by the thousands of names against such legislation.

IN a Sunday-law meeting in this city, Tuesday evening, March 11, Rev. R. S. MacArthur, pastor of Calvary Baptist Church, said, as to the keeping of the Sabbath, that if he were in a Mohammedan country he could observe Friday; if in a country where Seventh-day Baptists predominated he could observe Saturday, though he would prefer Sunday; and that in this country, as Sunday is the day observed, people ought not to object when required to observe it. Yet he insisted that the Sabbath is of divine and everlasting obligation.

The same day, in the City Court, a Chinaman, about to be sworn as a witness, when asked what form of oath he would consider most binding, replied:—

> Here in America I believe in the Bible, but in China I would believe in idols and my ancestors.

Dr. MacArthur’s views of moral obligation match quite well with those of that Chinaman.

THE attempt to shut all places on Sunday except those which are run in the interests of religion and the Church, has led an enterprising proprietor in Boston to label his dime museum on Sunday as follows:—

> Scientific Church. Grand concert and lecture on old maids and prize-fighters. Collection, 10 cents.

The genuine churches ought to be ashamed of such company as that. It may be replied that they are ashamed of it. Hardly; if they were ashamed of such company they would be ashamed to create it, as they do by the laws which they demand shall be enacted and enforced. So long as they are not ashamed to create such company, it cannot be said that they are ashamed of it after they have created it.

*The Gospel in All Lands* for March is one of the best numbers of that monthly which has ever been issued. Mexico is the subject of the “Monthly Missionary Concert,” which is especially interesting and cannot fail to increase the interest now felt in this country in Christian missions in that republic. “The Jesuit Campaign and Our Danger,” by Charles J. Little, LL. D., should be read by everybody, and the warning which it contains should be heeded. The author truthfully remarks that “the real danger lies not so much in the Jesuitism of Catholicism as in the Jesuitism of Protestantism,” by which he means the adoption by Protestants of Jesuitical practices, traditions, and methods.[97]
