IT is not the Roman Catholics alone who are complaining of the religious history that is taught in the public schools. The Presbyterians in Tennessee are at it too. They have petitioned the Legislature protesting against the introduction into the schools of the State, of a State history written by the Hon. James Phelan. They assert that in his chapter on "Churches" he has sadly "misrepresented the Presbyterian Church, and the reasons for the origin of the Cumberland Presbyterians," and that moreover, he shows too strong Methodist proclivities. We wonder if there would be any protest if he had shown strong Presbyterian proclivities. We hope so.
