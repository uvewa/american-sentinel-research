# The Blair Sunday Bill.

THERE are several semi-religious organizations and numerous newspapers devoted to the work of procuring legislation, State and national, in the interest of religious dogma and ecclesiasticism. The entering wedge is whittled down to a very fine point and presented as the Blair Sunday-rest bill. This measure proposes absolute restriction upon all manner of secular work upon Sunday in the Territories, the District of Columbia, interstate commerce, the mail service, and such other places and branches of service as are under Government jurisdiction.

The Blair bill is the mildest form yet proposed for religious legislation; but its true significance lies in its being an introduction for a system of statutory religion that would neutralize our free institutions and substitute therefor an ecclesiasticism that would re-inaugurate a reign of bigotry and persecution. Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty; and we had better put up with some inconvenience than to encourage a policy that is in its nature and all its developments inimical to the religious freedom that we now enjoy at such a vast expenditure of life and treasure. There are two enemies to free government; one is despotism, and another is anarchy, but an equally fatal tendency is that of bigotry and intolerance, and the latter shows out prominently in the spirit and management of those who are pressing the Sunday laws upon Congress.—*Osborne, Kansas, News.*

A CHURCH which has not enterprise enough to teach its own religion, in its own way, in its own hours, on Sunday, and in its own households, and through its own missions, does not deserve to be allowed to tack itself on the State.—*New York Independent.*
