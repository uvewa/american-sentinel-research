# National Righteousness.

THERE is no theory so unsound, no argument so utterly baseless, as the one which declares that national righteousness can be acquired by a State religion, either in name or in fact. Whether it is “putting God into the Constitution,” or putting the Church into the State, or in any way connecting the two, it is equally false. Yet such a theory is advanced, under various guises, by many well-meaning persons. They say that by connecting religion with the State it tends to make the State more Christian; that is, more just and gentle, more merciful and peaceful. Now we wish to show how entirely condemned is this false principle by its own actual experience.

For instance, in England we unfortunately have a direct union of Church and State. By this union religion is represented in the Government. The bishops of the Established Church have a seat in the House of Lords. It is fair to assume that these men are—most certainly should be—the most learned of all the clerical order, and are esteemed as the most devout and the most Christian. Being thus in the Legislature they are in a position of vast influence; and we might expect, if the underlying principle were true, that this influence would do much in making the State more righteous. But, alas, what do we actually find? We find that this vast influence has invariably been used on the side of wrong; and that the Church, instead of making the State better, has by the union been the means of making it more barbarous and devilish. We find by examining the votes of these unfortunate bishops that they have steadily opposed those reforms which to-day are looked upon as most necessary and Christian.

For example, about a century ago our criminal code was most wicked and cruel. Men and boys were hanged for such petty larcenies as are now punished by a few days’ imprisonment. During the reigns of the Georges there were added 156 new crimes to which the death penalty was attached. In 1810 a bill was introduced into the House of Lords to the effect that persons should not be killed “for the crime of stealing property to the amount of five shillings” ($1.25). This bill was rejected, and an archbishop and six bishops voted it down. Then we find the Church against the abolition of the slave trade. It was opposed to the education of the poor when that question was first agitated. It was against Parliamentary Reform; against Catholic Emancipation; and when the British and Foreign Bible Society was formed, it was against that. In fact, it is hard to find any salutary reform which it did not oppose by its representatives in the House of Lords.

Then, again, on the other hand, when the State has done wrong the Church has either been dumb or else egged it on. Going back to the last century, we find it was these bishops and clergy who, in the words of a leading statesman, “hounded on George III. and Lord North in their stupid and unrighteous resistance to the claim of our American colonies to honest representation and fair taxation.” The bishops earnestly supported every measure for carrying on the American war. When Europe was horrified at the wanton greed of gain and at the hypocrisy shown by Christian England in forcing opium on China at the cannon’s mouth, no word of remonstrance—not a grunt of disapproval—came from this bench of bishops. And in all our dreadful foreign policy, in all the incessant and unnecessary wars that England has waged in all parts of the world, this great influence of the Church has not been used to check or to condemn a policy so fearful. The bishops have too often fanned the fierce desire for bloodshed instead of pointing to a more excellent way.

Thus we see that by actual test the Church has failed—most miserably failed to make the State more righteous by being united to it. When it has used its influence, it has invariably done so on the side of wrong. When the State has endeavored to reform, the Church has opposed it; but when the State has done wrong then the Church has either remained dumb or else most valiantly cheered it on. And wherein lies the fault, not that the bishops were sinners above all other men, but the fault lies in the principle which declares that the Church can make the State more righteous by being united to it when as a matter of fact the Church, by such a union, becomes the bond-slave of the State.

“History repeats itself.” The moral of this is; let the clergy of any country insinuate themselves into Government affairs and their influence will prove a curse to that Government. Allow certain religionists to shape the Government and Constitution of America to their liking, a condition of things will then be produced similar to the palmy days of the Papacy. FRANK HOPE.
