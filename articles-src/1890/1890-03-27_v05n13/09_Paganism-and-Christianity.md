BISHOP ANDREWS, who has recently returned from a tour of inspection of the Methodist missions in Asia, reports that he found evidences in Japan of what he regards as a drift toward Christianity. The whole nation, he says is permeated with the fundamental principles of Christian civilization.

The same tendency has been discerned by other observers, and the advisability of formally adopting Christianity has every been discussed seriously by some of the Japanese statesmen and philosophers on the ground that the nation would profit by establishing the religion of the West. But this disposition toward Christianity is rather an indication of the absence of religious ideas and convictions than of the kindling of any new and genuine faith among the Japanese. The whole number of actual Christian converts there is put by Bishop Andrews at 25,000 only, while the population of the islands is about 35,- 000,000; and the educated people are described by him and other travelers as doubting or utterly rejecting all supernatural religion whatsoever. Such vital religious faith as there is remains among the common people; but the skeptical philosophers argue that so long as they have a religion of some sort it would not make much difference whether it were Christianity or Buddhism. The change, as the philosophers would make it, would be in name only.

Thus the state of mind among the educated Japanese is analogous to what it now is among many educated Europeans and Americans. They reject the old religious faith for themselves, but they regard its acceptance by the mass of the people as valuable for the preservation of the social order and system. The colleges and universities of Japan propagate religious doubt and scientific and philosophic theories subversive of all theology; and yet the temples are kept up to stimulate the faith of the humble faithful. Is not the same very much the case here? Our chief colleges exert an influence hostile to theological dogma and theory, but the churches continue to preach and uphold as much of the old belief as ministers will consent to inculcate and the attendents to receive. [The *Sun* might justly have added, and it ought to, that they are also seeking to have the State formally adopt it here as is proposed in Japan.—EDITOR SENTINEL.] This substantial agreement with their own sentiment and practice leads the Japanese philosophers to question whether they might not adopt Christianity as they see it manifested in the West, without any violent shock to popular prejudices and with material gain in their relations with the western civilization. That seems to be the explanation of such drift toward Christianity as there really is in Japan.

Nor can it be denied that they have some reason for so thinking, and that it has been strengthened by recent theological discussions in this country. The best of the candidates offering themselves as missionaries for the American Board are young men who have acquired in the theological seminaries of the Congregationalists, views whose logical tendency is toward the Japanese position. They doubt, or absolutely reject, the old and fundamental doctrine of everlasting punishment, and would govern God by rules and under limitations which satisfy the requirements of human reason. In other words, reason has become their God. So, also, the Presbyterians are demanding that their standard of faith shall be made consistent with reason, though in order to accomplish the change the whole system of theology, as held by all orthodox churches, must be destroyed. They would make man's reason and sentiment rather than God's will to rule in the world. They are on the road to an agnosticism as complete as that of the Japanese. The Presbyterian minister who asserted in the New York Presbytery that his church was taking Colonel Ingersoll as its guide and leader, was not far wrong. The movement for a revision of the Westminster Confession is a movement in that direction.

It seems to us, therefore, that instead of attempting to encourage a tendency toward indifferent Christianity in Japan, Bishop Andrews and all Christian Bishops and ministers should rather bind themselves together to revive genuine Christianity at home. New York to-day is a pagan city. The majority of the people, and more especially the educated people, are as much pagans as the inhabitants of Tokio.—*New York Sun, February 25, 1890.*
