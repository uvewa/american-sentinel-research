THE member of Congress who presented the local Sunday bill for the District of Columbia, in the House of Representatives, said, in an address in New York, as quoted in "Sabbath Reform Document" of January 9:—

> The State owes it to itself and to its present citizens, and to the generations that are yet to come, to protect this day, on precisely the same grounds that they protect the marital relation.

This member proposes to protect the day, by a law "to prevent persons from being forced to labor on Sunday." At the next session of Congress, then, we may expect him to introduce a bill "to prevent persons from being forced to violate the marital relation." [105]
