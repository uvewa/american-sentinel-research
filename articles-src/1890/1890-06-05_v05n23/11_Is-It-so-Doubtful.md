# Is It so Doubtful?

“THERE is not,” says the Denver *News, *“one chance in a thousand that the legislation advocated by Mr. Crafts will be enacted. It is very doubtful if five million adult persons could be found in the United States to favor it, when its scope is understood. The misfortune is that in trying to stamp Sunday with a character that is repugnant to our civilization, there is danger of repelling millions of people from its support as a day of national rest from toil. No more efficient means can be found for antagonizing all Sunday laws than an attempt to force the religious convictions of one class on another in respect to Sunday observance.”

“Dr. Crafts refers to the Sunday legislation on the statutes of many of the State as proof that public opinion would sustain the legislation he wants. It is true that many laws are in existence which do not accord with the grand conception of religious liberty that was entertained by the founders of our Government, and that was given expression in the national Constitution for Federal guidance. But Mr. Crafts might have added that in most cases such laws have no force, no attention being paid to them—which is a truer indication of popular sentiment.”
