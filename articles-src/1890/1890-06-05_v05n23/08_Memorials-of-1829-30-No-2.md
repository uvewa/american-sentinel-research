# Memorials of 1829-30. No. 2.

## Sunday Legislation An Anti-Republican Union Of Church And State.

> *To the Honorable, the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled:*

> The undersigned, memorialists of the town of Newark, county of Essex, and State of New Jersey, being apprized of the numerous petitions presented to your honorable body, praying a repeal of the present laws for the transportation of the mails and the opening of the post-offices on the first day of the week, beg leave (in accordance with their sense of duty) humbly to memorialize your honorable body, and pray that no such repeal be made, nor any law be enacted interfering with the Post-office Department, so as to prevent the free passage of the mail on *all* days of the week, or to exclude any individual from the right to receive his papers on the first, as well as on the seventh day.
> Notwithstanding, your memorialists have the fullest confidence in the wisdom and integrity of our national Legislature, they are induced to memorialize your honorable body at this time, from a fear lest the reiterated efforts of bigotry and fanaticism should finally prevail on your honorable body to legislate upon a subject which your memorialists consider is, by the Constitution of these States and the laws of nature, left free; and which, for the welfare of mankind, should be maintained so. Nor can they at this time refrain from expressing their astonishment at, and their disapprobation of, the reiterated and untiring efforts of a part of the community, who, through misguided zeal or ecclesiastical ambition, essay to coerce your honorable body into a direct violation of the principles of the Constitution, by the enactment of laws, *the object of which would be to sustain their peculiar tenets or religious creeds,* to the exclusion of others; thereby uniting ecclesiastical and civil law, and leading ultimately to the abhorrent and anti-republican union of Church and State.
> Your memorialists would not presume to remonstrate, were it not that their opponents (after a most signal defeat in last Congress) have renewed their petitions with a vigor increased by disappointment, and a spirit as perseveringly determined as their premises are illiberal and unwarrantable.
> Your memorialists approve of morality, reverence religion, and grant to all men equal rights, and are governed by the principles of our Constitution and the laws of our land; but we deprecate intolerance, abhor despotism, and are totally opposed to all attempts of the religions of any sect to control our consciences.
> Nor can your memorialists perceive wherein their opponents are deprived of their liberty of conscience by the uninterrupted course of the mails, for if it be right for them to travel on the first day of the week, it cannot be wrong for the mails; if it be consistent for them to do *their* business on the first day of the week, it cannot be inconsistent for the mails to be made up and opened, and papers delivered, on the same day; if the traveling *they* do, and the labors they perform, are matters of necessity, and therefore admissible, your memorialists humbly suggest whether the interests of a *vast majority of the citizens of the United States,* conveyed by mails, are not matters of as great necessity?
> Your memorialists, in accordance with these views, beg leave to protest against any interference with the transportation of the mails, or the distribution of letters at the post-offices, on the first day of the week. And your memorialists, as in duty bound, will ever pray, etc. January 8, 1830.
It will be seen from the foregoing that the reasons for the opposition of these petitioners to Sunday legislation was not on account of any opposition to the Christian religion, but like Madison’s memorial in Virginia in 1775, these memorials were prompted by reverence for, and interest in that religion. There is no doubt whatever that the religious denominations are in a much better condition morally in the United States, unaided by Government, than they would have been had they all these years received assistance from the civil power.W. A. BLAKELY.
