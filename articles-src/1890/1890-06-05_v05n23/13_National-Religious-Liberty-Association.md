# National Religious Liberty Association.

## Declaration Of Principles.

> We believe in the religion taught by Jesus Christ.

> We believe in temperance, and regard the liquor traffic as a curse to society.
> We believe in supporting the civil government, and submitting to its authority.
> We deny the right of any civil government to legislate on religious questions.
> We believe it is the right, and should be the privilege, of every man to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience.
> We also believe it to be our duty to use every lawful and honorable means to prevent religious legislation by the civil government; that we and our fellow-citizens may enjoy the inestimable blessings of both religious and civil liberty.
C. ELDREDGE, *President.*

W. H. MCKEE, *Secretary.*
