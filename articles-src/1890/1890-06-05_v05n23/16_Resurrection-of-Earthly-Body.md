THE *Christian Union* says that "Few intelligent Christians believe that the earthly body has any resurrection." Such "intelligence" as that is the most serious kind of ignorance. Such wisdom as that is of that kind which by wisdom knows not God, at the last. The earthly body of Jesus Christ had a resurrection, and so must every one have who will ever be where he is.
