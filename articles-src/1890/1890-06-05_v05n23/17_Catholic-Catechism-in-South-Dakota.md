A CONTRIBUTOR to the *Western Wave, *of South Dakota, states that in some of the public schools in Grant County in that State "the Roman Catholic catechism is being taught." Those who know of it ought to have it stopped. The Roman Catholics of South Dakota have no more right to use their catechism in the public school, than the Protestants of Wisconsin have to use the King James version of the Bible in the public school.
