# Should Be Taxed.

A CHICAGO paper has the following relative to untaxed church property in that city:

There is a vast amount of untaxed property in Chicago controlled by religious denominations. Although there are fewer Catholics than Protestants in the city, the former own 1,108 lots to the latter’s 866. The average sites of the Catholic churches are larger than those of the other denominations. Fifteen lots are occupied by the Catholic Church of the Nativity. St. Columbkill Sisters of Charity have sixtyeight lots; the Jesuit Church of the Holy Family eighty lots. Nearly one-third of all the Catholic land in the city is the property of the archbishop. Of this, much is unimproved; some of the land is occupied by tenants from whom a revenue is received. A very moderate estimate of the value of all the lots in the city held by [373] religious bodies puts it at $2,094,000, with the statement that it is probably twice that amount. All this property is exempt from taxation under the laws of the State of Illinois. The value of these lots is increasing rapidly, and the “unearned increment.” in a few years, will make the societies that own them enormously wealthy, like the Trinity corporation in New York, for instance; and yet while the people are groaning under the burden of taxation imposed by the city government, these valuable lots enjoy the protection of the law and the advantages of a great city, without paying one cent of taxes. In other words the people generally who own property are taxed to enrich religious societies. This is most unjust and will result in evil.
