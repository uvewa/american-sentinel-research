# Old Time Moral Laws.

THIS was a period when the so-called “blue laws” were most rigorously enforced, not only in Connecticut, with which tradition associates them, but in Massachusetts. In the former colony no food or lodging could be given to a Quaker, Adamite or other heretic. No one could run on the Sabbath day or walk in his garden or elsewhere, except reverently to and from meeting. No one could travel, cook victuals, make beds, sweep house, cut hair or shave on the Sabbath day. No woman could kiss her child on Sabbath or fasting day. Whoever brought cards into the colony paid a fine of five pounds.

No one could read the Book of Common Prayer, keep Christmas or saints’ days, make minced pies, dance, play cards, or play on any instrument of music except the trumpet, drum, or jewsharp. Liquor drinking was regulated, and the use of tobacco was tinkered incessantly. No one under twenty-one years, nor any one not previously accustomed to it, could take tobacco without a physician’s certificate. No one could take it publicly in the street or in the fields or woods, except on a journey of ten miles. Nor could any one take it in any house in his own town with more than one other person taking it at the same time. This last injunction was leveled at the so-called “tobacco parliaments.” About 1645 the Massachusetts magistrates were greatly troubled that the people would tell lies. — *Weeden’s “First One Hundred Years.”*

That was paternalism in government pure and unadulterated! And that is what the National Reformers are using their untiring efforts to again bring into force in this country in the ostensible interests of the “poor workingman.” Their paternal care for him seems to be more in the matter of resting on the first day, than in providing work for him the other six days in the week, as thousands of men in enforced idleness can testify.
