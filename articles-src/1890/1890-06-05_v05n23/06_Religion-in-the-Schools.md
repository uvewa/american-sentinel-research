# Religion in the Schools.

A CONFERENCE of the Protestant denominations of the State of New York, called to discuss the question of “moral instruction in public schools,” and to devise methods for its furtherance, was held in the council room of the University of New York, on November 17 and 18, with Rev. Howard Crosby in the chair. Delegates to the number of about fifty were present from all parts of the State, representing different denominations. The Baptists, alone, refused to take part in the Conference, taking occasion, in declining the invitation, to express themselves as unalterably opposed to the teaching of religion in the public schools of the State. The Secretary of the Conference in reporting the attitude of the different denominations toward the purpose of the meeting attempted to break the force of this positive expression of opinion from the Baptists by saying that they had evidently misapprehended the purpose of the Conference, but the clear and succinct statement of their reasons for failing to send delegates, contained in their reply to the call, was sufficient evidence that they understood the ultimate result to which these movements tend even better than those who planned and called the meeting.

The views and purposes which the Conference was intended to develop may be drawn from the subjects of the addresses upon the programme, which was accurately followed. The following are the topics for discussion:—

> 1. “The problem before us;” 2. “How can religious teaching in public schools be secured and rendered effective?” 3. “Statistics of moral instruction and religious exercises in the public schools of the State;” 4. “What do our Constitution and laws hold as to religious teaching in public schools?” 5. “What does expediency dictate as to any religious exercises in public schools?” 6. “How far does expediency dictate that State-supported schools should inculcate the principles of [372] morals and religion?” 7. “What should be the ground and character of the instruction in morals in our public schools?” 8. “What should this Conference do to carry out its views upon this subject?”

William Allen Butler struck the keynote in sympathy with the feeling which was apparently held by the majority of those present when he said:—

> We find that while there is in this State an absolute divorce of Church and State and a controlling mandate against interference by the State with the freedom of religious opinion and worship, there is not and never has been, any divorce between Christianity and the State, or between the State government in its administration and the Christian religion as revealed in the Scriptures. On the contrary, it was settled long ago, and cannot now be disputed, that Christianity is a part of the common law of this State, as it was a part of the common law of England, at the time when New York ceased to be a Colony of Great Britain and became a sovereign State.

It was Mr. Butler’s conclusion that the laws of the State would uphold the Department of Public Instruction in requiring religious instruction in the public schools to a specified extent. This address was extremely well received by the Conference and voted to be published and given a wide distribution. The address, however, did not meet the views of all. One delegate took exceptions to it in an able speech during which he very properly characterized the argument drawn from Blackstone’s declaration that “Christianity is part of the law of the land,” as arrant nonsense in fact, however strong it might be in legal precedent. Rev. W. H. Ward, editor of the *Independent*, also shocked the general sense of the meeting by saying:—

> We may consider it as settled that religion is not to be taught in the public schools. The American people will not trust the State to teach religion.

Although these unexpected differences of opinion threw something of a damper upon the enthusiasm of the meeting, still the business committee reported favorably a series of resolutions, which were adopted, in which it was declared that the State and religion were inseparable, and that the practical truths of religion should be inculcated in the public school system. A committee of from one to three from each Protestant denomination in the State was appointed to carry on the work, and further the interests of “moral instruction in the public schools.” W. H. M.
