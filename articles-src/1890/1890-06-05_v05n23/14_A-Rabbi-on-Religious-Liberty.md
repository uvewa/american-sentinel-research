# A Rabbi on Religious Liberty.

[The following paper is a speech delivered by Rabbi David Phillipson before the late Secular Congress at Portsmouth, Ohio. It has not previously appeared in print, and at our request was furnished to us by the Rabbi for publication in THE SENTINEL. The paper is a manly discussion of the question; the introduction; a merited rebuke to those who would make secularism and infidelity synonymous terms. Space has compelled us to somewhat abridge this paper. ]

IT may appear strange to many to see a preacher on this platform. I must confess that after some things I heard last night, it appears somewhat strange to me also, but as I have never been given to running away I shall stand my ground here, too. When I was requested to deliver an address before this body I was informed upon inquiry as to the purpose of this Union, that it had been formed with the object of emphasizing the necessity of the separation of Church and State in all their departments. Being in thorough accord with this, I consented to come, and I expected that all the addresses would be devoted to elucidating the principles of religious liberty in its various lights. I was not prepared to hear statements such as were uttered here last night: fierce attacks upon the Bible, upon religion, upon the preachers, etc. I feel inclined to cry to the speakers, “Shoemaker, stick to your last.”

If this society has been formed to promulgate the principles of the separation of Church and State, then why not stick to this text? It seems to me that well-nigh anything but this was spoken about. For example, last night we heard the Bible called a barbarian book. If the Bible were understood, no such expression would be applied to it by even the greatest extremist. It is true, and I do not for a moment deny, that there are passages in the book which designate a lower state of morality than we have reached to-day. It is true that there are sections which we would not have our children read, but with all that there is no justification for calling it a barbarian book.

If it were fully understood that the Bible represents in its various books a religious development, that it is the record of the religious progress of the Jewish people from idolatrous and anthropomorphic beginnings to the religion of the prophets, one God and one humanity, a point that the world has not come to even to-day, no one would be guilty of naming it a barbarian book. It says among other things in that Bible, “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.” Would you call this a barbarian book? It says in that Bible, “Thou shalt not oppress the stranger.” Would you call this a barbarian book? The fifteenth psalm in that Bible, in answer to the question, “Who shall dwell in God’s holy place? answers, “He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness and speaketh the truth in his heart; that uttereth no calumny with his tongue. Doeth no evil to his neighbor and bringeth no reproach on his fellowman; in whose eyes the despicable is despised, but that honoreth those who fear the Lord; that sweareth to his own injury and changeth not; that putteth not out his money for interest and taketh no bribe against the innocent.” Would you call this a barbarian book? The prophet Micah states as the highest object of life, “To do justice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with God.” Would you call this a barbarian book? These are but a few sentences which occur to me as I stand here; numberless others of like import could be quoted. Surely they do not sound very barbarous.

It must never be forgotten that the Bible is at once a historical record of the Jewish people, and the storehouse of eternal truths. The portions of the book dealing with the life of the people in Palestine are of historical value only; the other parts are the everlasting and undying truths by which, and through which, mankind has been helped onward and upward; they will endure forever, for truth is undying, and they express the truth of religion and morality, the truth of God. Whatever else they are they are not barbarian, for in many instances the words of the prophets and psalmist still stand above our vaulted civilization, and not the most bitter opponent of the Bible will call our civilization barbarian. But enough of this.

Another speaker of last evening made a savage attack upon the preachers. (Here the speaker took occasion to answer this also, and to show how this had nothing to do with the subject in hand). After this introduction, called forth by what I heard here last night, I will proceed to a discussion of the theme for the consideration of which I came to this meeting.

The principle of the separation of Church and State lay at the foundation of this Government, and if during the hundred [374] years of its constitutional existence the American Nation has grown false to its inheritance, if there is any danger that this bulwark of our liberties be overthrown (and the very foundation of a society of this kind is proof of the existence of this danger), then can we none too strongly by word of mouth and of pen, and by active interference protest against it, for it is the mission of the American Republic the duty it owes to itself and to the world, to the present and the future, to realize the fullest demands of liberty, and among the very first of these demands is the erection of a separating wall between Church and State in all their departments, as is so well set forth in the platform of this society. But you will pardon me if before I discuss the bearings of this subject in the present, I ask you to transport yourselves with me to the closing half of the last century, for then it was that the spirit of liberty awoke, and the beginnings which resulted in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of this country were laid in thought.

If we look to England we find the speeches of Burke, Fox, and Chatham, full of statements asserting the rights of man and emphasizing the necessity of separating religion from civil government; if we look to France, there are the writings of the Encyclopediac philosophers, of Diderot and Rousseau, there are the speeches of Mirabeau, the leaders of thought who were largely instrumental in hastening the coming of the cataclysm, the French Revolution, which marks the commencement of a new era in European history; the writings of these Frenchmen also largely influenced the minds of the founders of this Government. If we look to Germany, there was Kant in philosophy, whose reasonings inaugurated a new philosophical *regime;* there was Schiller, the literary apostle of freedom; there was Lessing, the noble and pure, who, in his beautiful drama, Nathan the Wise, preached the strongest sermon on religious toleration that the world had yet heard.

It was a remarkable period; men were throwing off the influences of old traditions; there was a wondrous activity of thought everywhere, a restiveness as though men were conscious of a vast impending change; the weight of ecclesiastical authority had rested most heavily upon mankind; there had been no such thing thought of as the separation of Church and State until this time; and even now, though many a voice was heard, yet few dwelt distinctly upon the proper province of each, and I wish to bring to your notice this morning one of these forgotten advocates of the principle that forms the basis of this Union.

I refer to the German Jewish philosopher, Moses Mendelssohn, who died in the year 1784. The Jews had no rights whatever in the Germany of that day—no rights as citizens, no rights as men. I will not dwell upon their condition, the same in Germany as all Europe; for the treatment of the Jews by men and governments forms one of the blackest pages in the history of the world.

In spite of all the disadvantages to which he was subject, Mendelssohn rose to a very high position in the world of thought. He contested successfully with Kant, Germany’s greatest philosopher, for the prize offered by the Berlin Academy of Sciences for the best philosophical treatise; he wrote the Phaedon, modeling it after Plato’s work of the sanie name and treating the same subject, the immortality of the soul; his nature was so pure, his disposition so gentle, that he was called the German Socrates; his style and diction were so clear that Kant wrote that Mendelssohn’s style seemed to him more fitting than any other to convey philosophical ideas clearly. One of the last books that he wrote he called “Jerusalem,” and in the first part of this book he discusses the relation between Church and State. . . .

The following sentences are extracts from Mendelssohn’s treatise: “One of the greatest problems of politics is to determine the proper relation between Church and State, between civil and religious rights, so that they may not encroach upon one another nor become burdens of our social life, encumbering it with greater difficulties than attach to it naturally.” “Church and State both have the mission to further human happiness, each in its own way.” “Neither Church nor State has any right to prevent any man from enjoying the free exercise of his opinions.” “The State has no right to appoint men to teach and enforce certain special religious opinions. Its duty in this respect consists only in appointing teachers who shall instruct the children in wisdom and virtue, and who shall spread such useful truths as the happiness of human society depend upon.” “The State has nothing to do with opinions which any ruling or any subjected church or synagogue accepts or rejects; it has only to be mindful that no doctrines be spread which are subversive of the public weal; it must be watchful only of the observance of these principles in which all agree, without the realization of which in the life of the people happiness would be only a dream and virtue itself no longer virtue. Naturally the State has no right to exclude any person from the enjoyment of political right on account of his religion, because, properly speaking, if each will cultivate its own premises there can never be any collision between Church and State. Neither Church nor State has any right to arrogate to itself in matters of belief any further right than the right to teach, any further power than the power to convince, any further weapon than the weapon of reason.”

All these sentences which I have quoted are commonplaces now. . . . But we must not forget that these thoughts were expressed over one hundred years ago, and that in Germany, at least, the Jew, Mendelssohn was the first who raised his voice calling for the separation of Church and State. He felt and knew of how much unhappiness and misery, of how much war and bloodshed, of how much intolerance and fanaticism, this unholy alliance had been the cause, and in the name of pure reason and clear philosophical insight he protested against it; and it was because of this protest, uttered in this little work, that Mirabeau, the French intellectual giant, who lived and died for man’s freedom, declared that this book, “‘Jerusalem,’ deserved to be translated into every language of Europe.” .

That book was written over a century ago, in the days of Washington and Jefferson, of Franklin and Madison, the same thoughts were agitating men in entirely different quarters of the globe. Has the world made as great progress as it should since that time? Have men become thoroughly and perfectly imbued with the idea that Church and State have each their own proper work? To those who observe and think, a backward movement is apparent in this our own day. Attempts have been made time and again to foist religion upon the Constitution, and although I am a minister of religion I shall always raise my voice in warning against any such attempt, for the world has never known any greater curse than this intermeddling of the Church in the affairs of the State.

For centuries men labored beneath this Atlas-load, and now that at last, in this country, at least, the laboring giant, man, has succeeded in throwing it off from his shoulders, who dare move one step toward placing it there again? This nation has, I believe, reached its present point of prosperity because it has kept these two departments distinctly separate. We have rested in the calm security that the liberties we have gained in this respect can never be wrested from us. Perhaps we have been too confident; perhaps we have not been wide enough awake to the attempts of so-called religionists in Washington and elsewhere.

(*Concluded next week*.)

To legislate for the promotion of the religious observance of any day as a Sabbath, is contrary to the Bible, to the Constitution of a free country and the rights of conscience.—*Sabbath Reco**rder.*

WHOSOEVER is afraid of submitting any question, civil or religious, to the test of free discussion, is more in love with his own opinion than with truth.—*Bishop Watson. *[375-376]

AT a Sunday-law Convention recently held in Burlington, Iowa, President Blanchard, of Wheaton College, said:—

> I would like to see the Christian people of this land stand aloof from political men and measures, until office-seekers agree to represent Christian principles in Christian government. If the churches would do this, political aspirants, to a man, would soon send up the cry, “What shall I do to be saved?”

No doubt of it; and the question would have no reference whatever to eternal salvation, but to salvation from political death.

“THE Evangelical Alliance at Boston,” says the *Mail and Express, *“demands the closing of the Chicago Fair on Sunday. Religious public opinion all over the country is a unit on the question. The managers of the Fair cannot afford to disregard this potent fact.” Certainly that is the verdict of “religious public opinion,” but how about the “civil Sabbath” of which we hear so much? What is the matter with the American Sabbath Union’s adjustable religio-civil rest day for the poor workingman who doesn’t want to rest?

THE *Cumberland Presbyterian*, Nashville, Tennessee, is credited with the following concerning Sunday and the World’s Fair:—

> We heartily join the protest against the proposition to keep open the coming World’s Fair at Chicago on Sundays. It may be that these protests and petitions can be made emphatic and overwhelming enough to prevent this contemplated insult to the Christian religion, this formal abolition of the Sabbath, for it will amount to that.

What a confession for a Christian paper! That which it sets forth as a divine institution, dependent upon the action of the Commissioners of the World’s Fair! But bad as this is it is not all that the *Presbyterian* says:—

> Those who are to decide the matter are supposed to be Christian men, and they may respect the united voice of Christian people. But to make our protests certainly effective they should carry with them something more than words. Make it certain that a Sabbath-breaking Exposition will not pay, and the Exposition will not dare to break the Sabbath. Some stronger leverage than words and entreaties should be brought to bear on the managers. These managers must make the Fair a financial success. The financial question with them is the tender nerve. The protest that touches that will be effective. If we believe in the Sabbath strongly enough to demand its preservation, to boycott a fair that refuses to preserve it, it will be preserved.

If this means anything, it means, taken in connection with the previous quotation, that the preservation of “the Sabbath” depends upon the success of a threatened boycott!

A LETTER from Fayette, Missouri, dated November 16, contains the information that “William Fritz and Robert Gibb, members of a Seventh-day Adventist Church in Howard County, near Armstrong, Missouri, have been indicted and arrested for performing common labor, on their farms, on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday. The cases are docketed for trial in the Circuit Court at Fayette, Missouri, on Tuesday, December 2, 1890.” By this it would seem that Missouri is anxious to put herself on record by the side of Tennessee, Georgia, and Arkansas as among the first to inaugurate a persecuting enforcement of religious laws.

THE Chicago *Times*, of the 9th inst., says:—

> All attempts upon the part of the State to interfere with individual rights are inimical to that personal liberty which the Republic engaged to protect, and without which it would be the veriest mockery. When an American shall not have the legal right to follow, without wronging his neighbor, his own bent, observe his own customs, do what he will with his day of rest, worship according to the dictates of his conscience, or, if he so incline, worship not at all, and direct the education of his children, he will be in no better plight than a subject of the czar of all the Russias. Such a day will never come.

We hope our contemporary will prove a true prophet; but R. M. King’s recent experience in Tennessee would lead us to think that “such a day” is not so very far in the future, even in this land of boasted freedom.

THE “Pearl of Days,” of October 17, has the following from the late Rev. Austin Phelps, D.D., professor in Andover Theological Seminary:—

> We live in an age in which individualism in matters of religion has run wild. The waning of authority in the Church has carried with it, on the downward grade, the restrictive duties and courtesies of Christian morals which were once subject to the common conscience of believers, in which now every one does that which is right in his own eyes.

The “Pearl of Days” does not point out the moral, but as the subject of the Doctor’s paper, from which these words are taken, was Sunday observance, we presume our contemporary thinks that the State should break down this individualism by civil law and establish a standard for Sunday keeping. Certain it is that the whole work of the Sabbath Union is opposed to individualism. But unlike other systems of religion, Christianity seeks to develop individual character. It teaches men to be men, and to do that which they regard as right, whether others do it or not. It will be a sad day for both the Church and the country when the power of the State is successfully invoked to destroy this individualism, and to bring all to a common standard regardless of their convictions.

MR. CRAFTS says:—

> It is admitted, by our opponent, that it is the province of civil law to enforce man’s duties to man, and especially to punish crime against man. It is exactly on this ground that Sunday laws forbid Sunday work and Sunday dissipation, namely, as crime against man. It is grand larceny to take away the toiler’s weekly rest day. Ceaseless toil is slow murder.

What is it then to imprison men and take away from them by fines and costs the fruits of their labor for quietly working from choice on their own premises on Sunday, and that after having conscientiously observed another day as they believed in obedience to the law of God? This has been done repeatedly in several States, and laws which make such things possible are still on the statute books of more than one commonwealth. It is a crime against natural rights to rob a man of anything, therefore Mr. Crafts should beware of robbing men of the right to labor on Sunday if they choose so to do. Those who want to keep Sunday have just the same right to keep it that others have not to keep it, but no more.

OF the “Leland Stanford Jr. University,” a California paper says:—

> The articles of endowment prohibit sectarianism and direct that there shall be taught that there is an all-wise intelligent God, and that the soul is immortal. The sexes will be admitted to equal privileges in every department of study, and preparatory schools will be established for children to bring them up to the standard required for entering upon the University course.

We have no fault to find with this; Senator Stanford has established and endowed the University as a monument to his dead son whose name it bears, and he has a perfect right to have taught in it whatever he sees fit; but the proposed instruction is not unsectarian. Tens of thousands of Christians in the United States do not believe in the natural immortality of the soul, but that immortality is the gift of God, and that it is received only as a gift. The doctrine of the immortality of the soul is sectarian. [377]
