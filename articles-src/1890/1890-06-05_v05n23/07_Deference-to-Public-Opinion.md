# Deference to Public Opinion.

THE Christian will do *his duty* regardless of public opinion. Though not indifferent to the good opinions of his fellowmen, and carefully avoiding all appearances even of wrong, yet he will never allow the views of his fellows to become a motive for action or non-action. Public opinion must not become conscience. Whatever the Word of God, and our conscience in obedience to the Word of God and the exigencies of the time demand, that must be done whether the world look sweet or sour. Every one is individually responsible to his God, he is not accountable to public opinion. Nearly everything good and great which has benefited the race, has been done, at the time in direct violation and contradiction of men’s preconceived notions and opinions.—*The Vindicator.*
