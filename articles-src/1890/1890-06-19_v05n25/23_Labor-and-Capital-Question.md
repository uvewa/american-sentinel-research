THE *Pacific Union*, a California labor paper, has the following:—

> When Mr. Gompers was asked what would be wanted after the eight-hour day, he answered, "More." And then what? "More." But how much more, Mr. Gompers? "Why, not one iota less than the full fruit of his toil. Put that on your banner."

Mr. Gompers does not say who will employ labor under such conditions, nor where the capital is to come from to inaugurate, and to support in their infancy the various enterprises that are to return to the laborer the full fruit of his toil. Such a demand, if general, would bring starvation to hundreds of thousands of homes, that under our present industrial system know no want. [201]
