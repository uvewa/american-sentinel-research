UPON the action of the late Presbyterian General Assembly upon the subject of religion and education, the *Sun* pointedly remarks:—

The Presbyterians want religious instruction in our public schools.

But how can we have it in this republic, where the Church and the State are wholly separate? What religion shall we teach? Shall it be Christianity or Buddhism, Judaism or the doctrines taught by Jesus?

The Presbyterians assail the Roman Church as the enemy of the school system; and yet they are joining forces with it in demanding religious education as a necessary part of the public-school system.
