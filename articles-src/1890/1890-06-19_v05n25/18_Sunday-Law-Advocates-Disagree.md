ABOUT the only thing in which the advocates of Sunday laws are perfectly agreed among themselves is, that they should have Sunday laws. But when it comes to the basis for the required legislation, they find themselves unable to agree. The National Reformers repudiate the idea of the "civil Sabbath." They maintain that the only proper ground for Sunday laws is the law of God, and very properly say that to admit any human authority or civil policy, would be to admit the right of the State to fix, and consequently to change the Sabbath; and to take this position would be virtually to say that were the State to change the day, they would also change their practice in the observance of the day.

But many, even among Christian ministers, assert that there is a civil basis for Sunday laws, and that they ask for such legislation, not on religious, but on civil and utilitarian grounds. This idea is made prominent by the American Sabbath Union, and by those who are working in harmony with them. It was the central thought in a recent Sunday law meeting held in Oakland, California, at which the Council of that city were requested to pass a Sunday-closing ordinance on purely "civil grounds." But to show the confusion which existed in the minds of the leaders of the meeting it is only necessary to say that the resolutions adopted, used repeatedly the term "the Christian Sabbath," and closed with these words: "We hereby express our decided conviction that the City Council should, without delay, pass an ordinance that will close all the saloons on the Sabbath day." This shows that it is not the "civil Sabbath," so called, which they wish to preserve, but the religious institution insisted upon by the National Reformers. It also shows the fact that nobody recognizes a "civil Sabbath;" that is, a Sabbath having any basis other than the authority of the Church or the authority of God.
