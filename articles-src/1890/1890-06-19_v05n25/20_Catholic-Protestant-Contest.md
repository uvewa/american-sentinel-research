THE *Converted Catholic* of this city says that "it is painfully true that former priests, and even converted priests, will receive ample compensation for their services in denouncing Popery in all its phases, and especially if they speak of the immorality and wickedness of Jesuit priests and nuns, but they can starve if they try to preach the gospel to the Roman Catholics." This simply shows that the contest between Catholics and Protestants is no longer one of principle but is simply a fight for advantage. This is further shown by the fact that Protestants are so ready to adopt Catholic methods and invoke the aid of the civil power to advance their interests.
