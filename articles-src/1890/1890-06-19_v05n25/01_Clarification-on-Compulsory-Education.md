THE statements in regard to compulsory education in the leader in last week's SENTINEL are not to be taken in an absolute sense; but as in intent agreeing perfectly with the propositions in the article reprinted from Judge Prendergast in the same paper. Taking, however, the phases of compulsory education which we had directly in mind we mean all that we said, that it is totally unwarranted and only evil. We shall print another article shortly, giving the facts which show this to be so. We merely make this note now to prevent any misunderstanding of the phrases in the article named.
