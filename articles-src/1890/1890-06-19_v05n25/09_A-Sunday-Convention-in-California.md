A DISTRICT Sabbath Observance Convention was held at San Jose, California, May 20 and 21, under the auspices of the California Sabbath Union and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. It will be understood that the word Sabbath here refers to Sunday. From the published call for the Convention, we extract the following:—

> The great importance of the divine institution, the steady growth of opposition to it as a sacred day of rest, the alarming prevalence of Sabbath desecration, and the danger that a continental Sunday may displace our true American Sabbath, all call for combined wisdom and united effort to promote Sabbath sanctification and to secure a righteous civil law in our State that will tend to prevent the contemptuous disregard of our precious rest-day.

Among the arguments brought to bear on the subject was the claim of Rev. T. B. Stewart, of San Francisco, that the murder of President Lincoln was a judgment of God on the Nation because the people of the North spent Sunday in rejoicing, with drums and cannon, over the surrender of Lee to Grant.

Mrs. Bateham, of Ohio, was quite hopeful of the future. "This question," she said, "is being agitated all around the world." She said:—

> We have in America tried the Puritan Sabbath, and we ought to know what its influence has been. Foreign nations have envied us this holy observance. All the nations of Europe are tending towards a more perfect keeping of the Lord's day. There has been a Sabbath Observance Congress in France, and we may soon expect a Sabbath law in this State. This is very encouraging, for France is one of the three spots in the civilized world that has no Sunday law. The District of Columbia is the second, and California, as you all know, is the third. ... We have passed the midnight hour on this question, and now the dawn is coming. . . . Even the railroads have been influenced, and the Sunday freight traffic has diminished by one-half. ... I have found a much stronger feeling in favor of this law in California than I expected, and I am greatly encouraged by such a Convention as this.

In the course of a subsequent address, Mrs. Bateham said:—

> There are people who ask for what they call a free Sunday. They should remember that liberty to play means liberty to work, and liberty to work means the liability to be compelled to work by those who are restless in their greed for wealth.

In this the speaker completely upset the plea for a "civil Sabbath," with which the people of California are being regaled. That theory would give men a free Sunday; in fact, *freedom* of the overworked laborers is professedly the great object sought. But according to Mrs. Bateham, they must not have freedom to play. What then must they have freedom to do? Let her own words tell:—

> We wish to secure this day safe from all work, in order that men may spend it with their families and have time to attend the house of worship and to study.

Those people who are credulous enough to accept the plausible civil Sabbath advances in favor of a State Sunday law may as well open their eyes first as last to the fact that no such thing is contemplated by the chief movers in this plot. The whole tenure of the sentiment expressed by members of the Convention was to the point of a sacred, religious observance of the day. Mrs. Bateham is an acknowledged mouth-piece of the Sundaylaw element, and her denunciations of a free Sunday are applauded by the California Sunday-law Union. Quite a number of honest people have been thus far duped with the idea of "merely a civil Sabbath;" but when this movement shall have culminated in law, they will find that a religious day underlies their expected day of recreation. They must not have liberty to play.

Dr. Hirst, President of the University of the Pacific, delivered an address on the subject, "Shall We Have a Continental Sunday, or the Christian Sabbath?" He, too, dwelt emphatically on the sacredness [198] of the day, and the dangers of making it a holiday. His emphatic declaration was: "Take religion out of the Sabbath, and it becomes only a foot-ball." He said:—

> It is deserving of notice that those who ask that the people should have a holiday, never think of asking that Wednesday should be set apart for that holiday. No; they ask for the Sabbath, for it is thought to be safer to rob God than to rob men.

We had noticed the fact ourselves, that when the specious pretext of a civil Sabbath for the workingman's physical benefit was being held up for the admiration of the public, it was always Sunday, never Wednesday, or any other day but Sunday. Now we have the admission of one of the Sunday-law champions, and an able one, too, that they mean to enforce the religious observance of the day,—the civil feature was only the sugar coating. There was one good suggestion the speaker uttered, which we think applies quite aptly to the movement he is advocating, namely, that "great evils are often, if not always, insidiously developed." This Sunday-law evil is coming to the front in just that way.
