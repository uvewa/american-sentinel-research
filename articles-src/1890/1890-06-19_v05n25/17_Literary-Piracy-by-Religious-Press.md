WE recently selected for our columns an article from one of the great religious papers of this city which we thought exceptionally good, and which we designed printing with proper credit. It was put into type, and came very near getting into the page before we noticed that it contained an entire paragraph which had been plagiarized bodily from the *Sun. *We have no objection to the *Sun;* indeed we think it a very good paper, but we feel ashamed to think that one of our leading religious papers is compelled to steal editorials from a secular paper. It is probably true that there is honor among thieves, that is, among ordinary thieves, but it is scarcely true of literary pirates.
