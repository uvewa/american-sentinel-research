IN an editorial on the "True Basis of Sabbath Laws," in its issue of May 29, the *Christian Statesman* 'unintentionally draws a comparison which does indeed show conclusively the true basis of civil laws for the observance of Sunday, as it existed in the mind of the writer. The article says:—

> The principle of Judaism would make the seventh day of the week our civil Sabbath. The principle of Mohammedanism would make the sixth day our civil day of rest. But our law has no such connection with Judaism or Mohammedanism. It has a connection however with Christianity.

Judaism would make the seventh day, Mohammedanism the sixth day, and Christianity the first day, our civil Sabbath.

By this collocation the authority of the three is equal and similar, each in its own sphere.

Nothing more is required to show the falsity of this position than to ask whether the authority of Christianity, or Judaism rests upon the same basis as Mohammedanism, and whether Judaism enforced the observance of the Sabbath by the same authority from which Mohammedanism derives its right to enforce its rest day, and whether *true* Christianity bears the same relation to Judaism, which Mohammedanism does to Judaism?

No religion enforced by, and observed in obedience to, a civil statute can be anything else than a man-made religion. Mohammedanism is a man-made religion, and the legal Christianity proposed by the *Statesman* would be no better, for it would be liable to all manner of human perversions and corruptions.

W. H. M. [199-200]
