A DENVER paper says: "The advocates of Sunday legislation are finding fault with Denver Sunday recreations, and will endeavor to close Elitch's Zoo, stop the Berkeley motors, and shut off the City Park concerts. The last-named is not so much an eye-sore, however, as the concerts do not occur until 4 P. M. The sky is ruddy, however, with an effort to force, people to either remain at home on Sunday or go to church." [195]
