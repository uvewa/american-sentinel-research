REV. THOMAS DIXON, JR., pastor of the Twenty-third Street Baptist Church, of this city, is credited with the following sensible utterance concerning the Sunday paper:—

> In my humble opinion the Sunday newspaper has come to stay. It is useless to rave and talk wild talk on this subject. You cannot destroy it. It has a mission. Why not cease our efforts to destroy, and seek to convert it and make its great cylinders to throb with the great truth of the living God, and send its messages of love and faith circling round the world? The Sunday newspaper is no rival of the pulpit. To be candid, I would rather, myself, read a live newspaper than listen to a dead man try to preach. The preacher who cannot hold his own against cold type is not called to preach, and the sooner he quits trying to preach, the better for him and the better for the cause he represents.

The only answer that can be given to Mr. Dixon's query is that the gospel which the Sunday-law advocates proclaim is not one which seeks to convert, but one which seeks to compel; it is not a gospel of moral suasion but of physical force. Mr. Dixon's would be the better plan, but it can never be popular with those who having departed from the spirit of the gospel have imbibed the spirit of the Inquisition.
