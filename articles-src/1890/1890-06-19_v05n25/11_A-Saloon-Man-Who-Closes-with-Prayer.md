WE do not vouch for the statement, but it is said that "a saloon man has been found in Washington who closes his place with prayer. His application for renewal of license having been rejected on the ground that his place bore a bad name, he appeared before the commissioner in his own behalf. In reply to the question, 'Do you shut up promptly at midnight?' he answered: 'When ten minutes to twelve comes, I kneel down, say my prayers, and shut up.'" Prayer under such conditions would be just about as much of a farce as is the labeling of governments and corporations, Christian, when everybody knows that they are nothing of the kind, and when in the very nature of the case they cannot be Christian.
