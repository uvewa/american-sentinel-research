THE President of the American Sabbath Union recommends his Saturday evening paper for Sunday reading. But the one objection that takes precedence of all others against the *Sunday* newspaper is that the reading of it keeps many people from church, and that those who read it and go to church are very much hindered in their devotions, and their listening to the sermon while at church. Now will not the reading of Mr. Shepard's Saturday evening paper on Sunday have the same effect? And if so, will the American Sabbath Union advocate the abolition of Mr. Shepard's Saturday evening paper? If not, why not?
