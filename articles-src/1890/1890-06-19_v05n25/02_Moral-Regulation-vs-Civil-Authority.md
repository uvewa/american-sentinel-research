A MARKED feature of the debate, in the Senate, on the bill "subjecting imported liquors to the provisions of the laws of the several states," which was introduced to do away with the result of the "original package" decision of the Supreme court, has been an almost universal consideration of the question from a "moral" point of view. "Regulation of morals" and "protection of morals," by the police power of the State, have been phrases in constant use throughout the discussion. If the highest deliberative body in the Nation fails to distinguish between sin and crime, immorality and incivility, and in its debates presupposes the right of the State to "regulate morals" by police power, how far are those who are striving to bring about the general governmental supervision of morals from the accomplishment of their purpose?

The moral question as to whether a man shall injure his own health, blunt his moral sensibilities and come short of eternal life, through the use of intoxicants, or any other agent, is an entirely different question from the civil issue as to whether another man may manufacture and expose for sale that destructive agent.

The manufacturer and seller of intoxicating liquors must answer to God for the sin of tempting his neighbor to his destruction, but for the crime against the peace and welfare of the State he is answerable to the police power of that State.

The manufacture, transportation, and sale of intoxicating liquors, so far as the authority of Congress or the police power of the State is concerned, has nothing to do with morals, but is solely a matter of the jurisdiction of the municipal law.
