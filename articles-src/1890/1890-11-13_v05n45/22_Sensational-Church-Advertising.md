THE following is from the *Christian Advocate*, of this city:—

> The religious notices in our Sunday papers quite frequently afford suggestive reading. Some of them are cheap, frivolous advertisements, and better adapted to a Bowery show than a Christian church. But the desire to get a crowd is almost a disease with some men. Success to them is a matter of camp-stools and extra chairs, and a full church an evidence of genius. It is a matter of profound thankfulness that the Methodist ministers of this city are singularly free from blame in this matter. Perhaps they have the crowd already and do not require startling topics and sensational head-lines to fill their churches. But churches filled in this way are soon emptied, and even when filled, they are empty.

We are glad that the *Advocate* can say that the ministers of the denomination which it represents are free from blame in this matter. But there is another matter in which they are not thus free, namely, in the demand for laws which they imagine would drive people to the churches, by depriving them of Sunday papers, and by closing to them the various places of secular resort. It is true that rigid Sunday laws strictly enforced might fill the churches, but it is also true that if filled in this way they would still be empty.
