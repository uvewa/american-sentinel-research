BY its persistent appeals for sumptuary laws the *Rocky Mountain News* is inviting its party to defeat. It goes so far as to say that to open barber shops on Sunday is "the violation of a divine law," and "that, if necessary, a city ordinance should be adopted to keep the shops closed on Sunday." Of course on the same principle the *News* would advocate a State and national Sunday law, which is at variance with one of the vital principles of our national Government. . . . If the journeymen barbers desire to rest on Sunday there is no law to prevent them from doing so, and they have a perfect right to refuse to work on that day. Sunday rest is a question which every American citizen should be allowed to determine for himself. He may desire to rest on the seventh day of the week in accordance with his religious belief or from personal choice; or on the second day of the week for like reasons.—*Colorado Graphic*. [359-360]
