# Majority Rule.

THE following upon majority rule is from a speech by Hon. Joseph Wheeler, of Alabama, in Congress, February 13, the House having under consideration the report of the Committee on Rules. While all will not concede the honorable gentleman’s implied claim that the Democrats have greater regard for the Constitution than the Republicans have, all must, laying aside political prejudices, acknowledge the truth of the principle laid down. Commenting upon the statement that “the rule of the majority is at the very basis of our Government,” Mr. Wheeler spoke as follows:—

While it is true that the majority should rule, all that the Democrats desire is that they shall rule under the Constitution. Judge Cooley in his Principles of Constitutional Law says:—

> So far, then, from the Government being based on unlimited confidence in majorities, a profound distrust of the discretion, equity, and justice of their rule is made evident in many precautions and checks; and the majority is, in fact, trusted with power only so far as it is absolutely essential to the working of republican institutions.

Since the first dawn of civil liberty the wisest statesmen of all nations have agreed that an unbridled and unrestrained majority is the most dangerous foe of liberty, and therefore, in perfecting systems of government, the greatest care was taken to devise means by which a majority could be checked by certain powers given to the minority, and the history of civilization has proven the wisdom of maintaining such checks and balance.

If a man perfect in all respects and of unquestionable and infallible wisdom could be found, a people would be fortunate in giving such a person absolute power, because undoubtedly his rule would be wise and perfect in all respects, and that is all that was ever asked for or is desired by any people, but the history of the last eighteen hundred years shows that during that period no such man has existed, and therefore it has been demonstrated that the only way to preserve liberty is for the people to govern themselves.

If ages of experience demonstrate that one-man power is destructive to liberty, how much more dangerous is an unrestrained rule of a majority. It contains all the evils which follow from the concentration of all power in one man, without a single element of the advantages of such a system of government. It is the existence and presence of absolute power and the absolute absence of any tangible responsibility. It is possible for such a government to exist for some time without becoming tyrannical and despotic, but it is impossible for such a government to exist without finally overthrowing all the safeguards of liberty.
