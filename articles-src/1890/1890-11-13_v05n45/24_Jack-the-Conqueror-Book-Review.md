THE real dignity and worth of a book are not always indicated by its title; this is true of "Jack the Conqueror," No. 2 of "The Young People's Library." The subtitle, "Overcoming Difficulties," is, however, really descriptive of the book and relieves, in a measure, the somewhat unpleasant impression created by the more sensational appellation.

The book contains three stories, all well calculated to beget worthy ambitions and stimulate to praiseworthy effort. It is probable that none of the narratives are unvarnished recitals of the experiences of a single individual, yet they are exceedingly true to life, and will tend to correct rather than give those false views of life which are so common in story books, and so harmful to the young. Altogether, "Jack the Conqueror, or Overcoming Difficulties" is a very readable and worthy juvenile book which can be safely placed in the hands of the young. "The Young People's Library" deserves, and should have, the support of all who really desire to secure unobjectionable reading for their children. The numbers are of uniform size, style, and price. Each volume contains 160 pages 5x7 inches; the cheaper binding is paper, the more expensive, cloth embossed in jet and gold. The volumes sell for 25, and 50 cents, according to binding.
