THERE is nothing which so fully illustrates the foolishness, and injustice of a union of Church and State, as this extract from a law enacted by the Puritan Parliament of England: "No person shall be employed but such as the House shall be satisfied of his real godliness." This precluded the employment of any one who was not indorsed by the priests of the State religion.—*Loyal American*.
