WE are asked by a correspondent to answer the following question:—

> If the seventh-day people who now object to being compelled to keep Sunday were in the majority, would not the fourth commandment, which says, "In it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates," require them to make laws compelling the Sunday people to keep the seventh day?

Not as we understand the commandment. "Within thy gates," means only upon property under your immediate control; not the whole of any country. It is the duty of every man to see to it that no work is done on his own premises upon the day that he regards as the Sabbath; but the commandment gives no warrant whatever for Sabbath legislation. Were they in the majority, seventh-day people might, like others have done before them, apostatize from God and appeal to the State, but in so doing they would prove recreant to the very principles which they now maintain.
