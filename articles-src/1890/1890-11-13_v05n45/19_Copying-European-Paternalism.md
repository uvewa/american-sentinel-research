IN a speech in the Senate on the 30th ult, Mr. Carlisle denounced the new tariff bill as "an entirely new departure in the application of the principle of protection in this country copied from the paternal governments of Europe." How true this is is not for us to say; but that this country is copying from the paternal governments in many things does not admit of a doubt. The effort seems to be to make the Government everything and individuals and States nothing. And in this aping of European methods of government most of the several States are not one whit behind the general Government; paternalism is in the air.
