OUR liberal exchanges don't seem to like our "Lesson from Paine." *Freethought *and the *Truth Seeker* both protest that Paine didn't, know what he was talking about. The *Truth Seeker* says: "Paine made his point as a Deist, and made a mistake" We are aware that Paine was a Deist, and that he made many and grievous mistakes, but his estimate of the benign nature of the Christian religion, and of the origin of Church and State was not one of them. An important difference between Paine and many of his modern disciples, is, that, whereas he conceded to others the same freedom of opinion that he claimed for himself, the average "Freethinker" of the present day is about as intolerant as a Jesuit.
