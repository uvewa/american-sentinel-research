THE *Ironclad Age* observes that "Archbishop Ryan says he doesn't want any more union of Church and State than there is," and remarks the fact that "Catholicism has got a safe hold upon the public treasury and it is content." Sure enough, so long as they have the game without the name, why should they not be satisfied? Their property is exempt from taxation, the Government supports their mission schools among the Indians; and in some of the States, notably in this State, they have their arm in the public treasury up to the elbow, with every prospect that they will soon be in all over. There is, indeed, little left to be desired.
