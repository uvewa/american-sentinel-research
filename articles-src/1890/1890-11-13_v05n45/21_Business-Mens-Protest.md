"THE National Reform Association," says the *Union Signal*, "has started a 'Citizens' and Business Men's Protest,' and requests all citizens, especially those engaged in active business, to write to the Columbian Exposition Committee, Chicago, using preferably their own printed letter heads, and saying simply, 'I join,' or 'This firm joins, in the protest against the proposed opening of the World's Columbian Exposition on the Sabbath.'" It is suggested that there are few towns where such letters cannot be secured from a majority of the business men. This seems very likely, when we remember that the boycott is to be used, if needs be, to secure Sunday closing of the great Fair.
