"INTOLERANCE," says *Public Opinion *of San Francisco, "should not manifest itself in any quarter on the day of election. The American people should not proscribe any citizen on account of either his nationality or his creed. Particularly careful should they be not to send a candidate, who is to the manner born, out of their own party because he does not belong to their church. It was broadly hinted at San Jose that the delegates from the interior would have no candidate who does not belong to the American religion, whatever that may be." We are afraid, however, that the drift is in the direction of a religious test for candidates. The "American religion" may not as yet be very clearly defined, but nobody knows how soon it may be, and how soon men must profess the "American creed" in order to secure votes. It is certain, however, when the time does come every man who is in politics for office will be a Christian after the straightest sect of the "American religion," whatever it happens to be.
