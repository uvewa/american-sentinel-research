THE *Christian Union, *an influential journal, would like to see the Bible used in the public schools simply as a text book of literature and history, but adds that "if our Catholic, Jewish or Agnostic brethren object to opening schools with acts of worship, such worship should in our judgment be discontinued." We can speak in behalf of Jewish-American citizens who, without exception, are unalterably opposed to teaching sectarian doctrines of any kind in our public schools. We are for an absolute divorce of Church and State in every sense of the term.—*Jewish Times and Observer.*
