THE American Sabbath Union, with the National Reform Association, and all their numerous allied organizations, are stirring the whole country to bring to bear such an influence upon the managers of the World's Fair that they will give religious recognition to Sunday, not by permitting the closing of such exhibits as it pleases the exhibitors to close, but to compel the exclusion of the public and the entire cessation of all the business of the Exposition on that day, whether such an arrangement shall coincide with the wishes of the exhibitors and the public, or not.

The effect of the agitation for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, is evidently to cement the forces of religious nationalism in a more compact body, acquaint them more fully with their own power and numbers, and give them assurance to drop the specious plea for a "civil Sunday" entirely, and concentrate their entire effort openly, and without reserve, upon the securing of the enforcement of a religious observance of Sunday.

The following, from the "Pearl of Days," will show how, as that publication says, "there has never before been such an awakening" of a desire to secure the enforcement of a religious form:—

> "The mails are bringing us daily a great number and variety of petitions to be forwarded to the Columbian Commission against opening the World's Fair on Sundays. Some are very short and general, others are longer and more in detail, and others are carefully elaborate in argument but all manifest one and the same earnest, decided and urgent spirit of patriotic, and Christian opposition to the opening of the Exposition on the Lord's day. Many of them are from the Young People's Societies of Christian Endeavor, and from Sunday-school officers, teachers, and scholars, and from county and State Sunday- school conventions. Others come from pastors, officials, members, and adherents of congregations of nearly all denomi nations—and often these have been authorized by a rising vote.

> "Then follow numerous resolutions, appeals, protests, and petitions, by the unanimous action of ecclesiastical assemblies of all grades, and which represent hundreds of thousands of the best people of the whole country. Temperance organizations, patriotic orders, labor unions, and similar societies also wheel into line. Young Men's Christian Associations are working faithfully for the cause. Outside of all these, we are constantly receiving petitions from citizens of important places without distinction of sect, sex, or race, and covered with hundreds of signatures of reputable persons. The reasons assigned are legal, historical, patriotic, humane, benevolent, moral, and religious. They insist upon the divine institution, the permanent obligation, the blessings and privileges of the Sabbath of God and man. They deprecate the desecration of the Christian Sabbath at the Exposition as an affront to its Lord, as a wrong to the Nation, as a disgrace to the fair name of our country, as a transgression of the laws of Illinois, and of every State that has any Sabbath laws. . . . And finally and supremely, in all these documents, the warm Christian feeling of the country is expressed in ardent love for the hallowed day, in loyal obedience to the fourth commandment, and in deprecation of God's judgments upon this generation for the violation of his law of the rest day."

All this is significant, not indeed of a revival of fervent piety, but of a religious feeling which manifests itself in formal observances while neglecting the weightier matters, judgment, mercy, and faith. Sunday is fast becoming recognized as "the badge of all religion," that is of all form religion, and those who so regard it will never rest till they secure for it formal recognition from the national Government.W.
