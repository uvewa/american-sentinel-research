A PITTSBURG paper, of the 18th ult., contains, under the above heading, a two- column account of the trouble which, owing to the efforts of the Covenanter Church to control the political action of its members, has, for some months past, been causing its leaders not a little anxiety. The following statement of the facts is abridged from the Pittsburg *Gazette:—*

> One evening in last July, several ministers of the Reformed Church,—Presbyterian, or Covenanter Church,—held a meeting to formulate their views on certain topics connected with church matters. The result of that meeting was a circular denominated a "Platform of the Friends of Christian Union in the Reformed Presbyterian Church." The platform is as follows:—

> The platform adopted by the recent Conference of the friends of Christian Union in the Reformed Presbyterian Church on July 22. 1890. We, the undersigned, agree together in maintenance of the following principles:—
> 1. That while we hold it to be the duty of the church to maintain the most advanced testimony in behalf of truth and against error, yet the terms of the communion ought to be limited to the plain requirements of the Scriptures—namely, faith in Christ and obedience to his revealed will.
> 2. That persons who make a credible profession of Christ should be received into church membership, on their acceptance of our testimony and the testimony of communion, without binding them to any explanation in the matter of political dissent, or any other questions.
> 3. That restricted communion, and not close communion nor open communion, is the teaching of the Bible and of our standards.
> 4. That interchange of pulpits should be allowed among those who preach the evangelical doctrine of the gospel.
> 5. That there should be organic union of the whole Christian Church upon the basis of the plain teaching of the Scriptures.
> 6. That free discussion should be allowed of our subordinate standards and of deliverance of synod, testing them by the Bible, which is the only rule of faith and manners.
> This was signed by the following named ministers: J. T. Carson, N. M. Johnston, S. D. Johnston, A. U. McClurkin, H. P. McClurkin, J. K. McClurkin, J. C. K. Milligan, J. R. J. Milligan. J. S. T. Milligan, O. B. Milligan, E. M. Milligan, Hugh W. Reed, H. W. Temple, S. G. Shaw, J. R. Thompson. Elders: S. R. Mitchell, J. McCullough, and A. Ennisse.
> In a few days, the matter had become known by the radical elements in the church, and the progressive clergymen were at once marked for official censure. Professor D. B. Wilson, D. D., R. J. George, D. D., and Moderator David McAllister, D. D., were the recognized leaders of the unchangeable element.
> When the presbytery met, Professor Wilson presented papers designated as a "form of libel" against Rev. Henry W. Temple and Rev. Hugh W. Reed. Professor Wilson charged in his paper that the ministers named had been guilty of heresy and political teachings; of a violation of the vows of their ordination and the breaking of the church's solemn covenant. These offenses were because they had circulated and caused to be printed the platform given above. The charges were about to be referred to a committee when Rev. O. B. Milligan objected to them being received by the presbytery, as they were unsigned and therefore ineligible as libels in the court. After some discussion it was decided before formally proceeding against the accused to hear them in their own defense. Rev. J. R. J. Milligan, who spoke first, stated that his remarks would be few. Said he:—
> Of this whole affair there seems to be more misapprehension than anything else, Individually I want a speedy action. I want this matter settled at once, as a matter of justice to myself and my congregation. All this distrust must be removed. 1 was at the East End Conference. I helped to adopt the platform and send it out, but since that time it has been misunderstood if not misrepresented. If these charges of covenant breaking, heresy, and apostasy are true then I am unfit to be a minister in the Covenanter Church, or in any church.
> On these matters my views are set, and if I cannot keep them within the church I will take the other alternative and get out.
> Rev. E. M. Milligan said that there was nothing in all their course of which he was ashamed. He denied that either at that meeting or at any other time he had been guilty of insubordination, covenant breaking, or apostasy. Mr. Milligan traced the church history since 1833, and declared that the church herself had been inconsistent, in that she had in 1871 admitted to be right what in 1833 was condemned as wrong and sinful, and caused the split in the Presbyterian Church. In 1871 the legitimacy of the United States Government was recognized by the Covenanter Church. If this is true, then they were bound to support and defend this Government, he said. In regard to the incorporation of the church with an immoral government, Mr. Milligan said that if voting on amendments was one of those things, then very few members of the church believed it. At this utterance, Rev. Dr. Thomas Sproull, one of the presbytery fathers, who had been listening intently, jumped to his feet and demanded that it stop.
> "Mr. Moderator, when will this stop? How long must I listen to it?" He was ruled out by the Moderator under the terms by which the offenders were allowed the fullest explanations. Continuing, Mr. Milligan said that on that point and on others he defended his privilege of holding a private opinion, "And I will stick to it," said he.
> Rev. A. W. McClurkin also denied his guilt as charged. Said he, "If we refuse to advance, to go higher in the development of the truth, then we shall be false to our teachings, and until we do move higher we shall be false to the trust that God hath given unto us." [358]
> Rev. O. B. Milligan indorsed the sentiments of the preceding speakers, and declared that instead of the meeting in his church being to disorganize or disintegrate the Covenanter Church, it was for the purpose of promoting church unity.
> Rev. W. L. C. Thompson took up the platform, and after a strict comparison with the church laws showed that in his opinion they were in harmony.
> I have always held private opinions on church unity and on other church affairs and they have not been questioned until now. If guilty of heresy I will stand the censure, but, understand me, my private opinions must not be governed by the private opinions of other men. I have not preached these doctrines, nor have I spoken of them in private unless they were first broached to me. My views are known and plain and there I stand, and I cannot do otherwise.
> Rev. H. W. Temple, who was mentioned as the leading spirit of "the seventeen," next took the platform, and picking up the circular, said:—
> For my connection with this I am branded as an apostate, as a breaker of covenants, as a violator of my sacred vows of ordination as a minister of the gospel; as a heretic and a teacher of wrong. Is it possible, is it possible that a minister of this church or any other is cited for crimes because he subscribed to these doctrines? I do not deny anything; I do not defend myself, and I have nothing to explain. The invitation of this committee to have a free and frank discussion is very open, but it may have been intended to draw us out with the intention of using our own language as testimony against us. I believe it to be so. Nevertheless, with the expectation that what I say will be used against me, I repeat that there is nothing that I have to defend. It is true that I did have this platform printed.
> Mr. Temple concluded with a few remarks that were rather defiant in tone and which moved several of the members of the court to interrupt him.
> Rev. Dr. R. J. George, Rev. Dr. McAllister, Rev. Dr. Thomas Sproull, and Prof. Wilson then took the floor successively and endeavored to convince the young men of their errors. After a hearing of both sides without getting near a satisfactory conclusion, Rev. Dr. McAllister offered the following as a basis of settlement:—
> The undersigned members of the Pittsburg Presbytery of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, with a view to the restoration of brotherly harmony and confidence, agree to the following declarations concerning the position and duty of the Reformed Presbyterian Church:
> 1. While the word of God is the only supreme standard of faith and practice, the authoritative interpretation of that word by the church must be accepted as the rule to be practically applied for the regulation and conduct of her members as well as the statement of their profession.
> This admits of the probability of error in the church's interpretation of God's word and leaves the way open for the most full and candid and at the same time orderly discussion of our doctrines and laws in the light of the only infallible standard, and for the orderly revision of her doctrines and amendment of her laws, to bring them whenever necessary into close harmony with the divine word.
> 2. The Reformed Presbyterian Church has interpreted officially and authoritatively the divine word as forbidding her members to become parties to the compact of the Constitution of the United States either by accepting office to administer the compacts of Government or by the exercise of the elective franchise in sending men as representatives to administer it, because that compact does not acknowledge the law of Christ as the supreme standard of morals for the Government, but places the people in that place instead of the word of God. This interpretation is the law of the Covenanter Church to-day.
> 3. That the members of the Covenanter Church have always held this position and still hold it with the purest Christian patriotism, and with most cordial readiness to perform every duty to their country, and to sacrifice in the future, as in the past, not only their property, but, if necessary, their lives for their beloved country's highest good.
The paper presented by Dr. McAllister failed to meet the views of the accused, and it was withdrawn. As a last resort, after several other plans had been proposed and rejected, the report of the Committee on Discipline recommending a judicial committee with full power to try the case was adopted. A committee will be appointed by the Committee on Supplies and confirmed by the presbytery. The presbytery will meet again on the second Tuesday in April, 1891.
