EX-PRESIDENT JOHN BASCOM, in a recent address before the graduating law class of the Wisconsin University, took occasion to criticise the decision of the Supreme Court of that State, which excludes the Bible from the public schools. In the course of his remarks, Dr. Bascom said:—

> The Court excluded religious instruction in order to get rid of sectarian instruction. Under a direct interpretation, the Bible is not a sectarian book. All Christian sects assign it distinctly a central position.

A division of the people, cut off and separated from the rest of mankind by reason of the religious doctrines which they hold, constitutes a religious sect, and the doctrines of a sect are sectarian. Anything, therefore, which is accepted by a part of the people, and not by the whole people, is sectarian in its character. If a religious doctrine was received with favor by every one in the world, of course there would be no one to oppose it, and such a doctrine would be non-sectarian. On the other hand, if there is any opposition to a doctrine, that very fact shows that it is not acceptable to the whole people, but that it is indorsed by only a part of the people, a sect, and is therefore sectarian. The fact that the Catholics of Wisconsin made complaint against the religious instruction which was formerly given in the public schools of that State, is all the evidence that is needed to show that such instruction was sectarian, and was not acceptable to the whole people.

And further, it is an undeniable fact that no religious instruction could be given which would be indorsed by the whole people. And as surely as it was accepted by only a part of the people, a sect, so surely would it be sectarian in its character. Hence, the only way to exclude sectarian instruction, is to exclude religious instruction of every description.

Dr. Bascom says of the Bible, "All Christian sects assign it distinctly a central position." Suppose this were true of the King James version, does he not know that there is the most wide-spread difference of opinion as to how it should be interpreted? Another important question which the Doctor seems to have overlooked, is this: Are Christians the only people in the world? Is it not a fact that a majority of the people in this country do not even profess to be Christians? Do non-believers assign the Bible "distinctly a central position"? If they do not, then, according to the Doctor's own argument, the Bible is a sectarian book. For to prove that it is not sectarian, he offers the statement, that "all Christian sects assign it distinctly a central position." Consequently, if there were any sects which do not assign it a central position, he would have to admit that it is sectarian. But the Bible is just as sectarian to all who do not believe in Christianity, as it would be to any professed Christian sect if they rejected it. A sect is a division of the people, and not necessarily a division of Christians; and unbelievers are people the same as Christians are. It may be convenient to ignore people and their rights, when they do not agree with us, but it does not show a love of honesty and justice to do this. But such is the only process by which religious instruction can ever be maintained in schools controlled by the State, and supported by public taxation.

No one will deny that the Catholics are a sect, yet they do not assign the King James version of the Bible a central position, or any position at all.

The fact is, all Christians taken together constitute a sect, a division of the people, distinct and separate from the rest of mankind. And this is right. God's people have always been sectarian in their belief and practice, and it is by the command of God that they are so. "Come out from among them, and be ye separate," saith the Lord, "and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you." As Christians are a sect, and Christianity sectarian, the Bible, which is the exponent of Christianity, must also be distinctly sectarian in its character.

A. DELOS WESTCOTT.
