"THE work of converting the heathen world goes on apace," says *America*. "One of the latest steamers to leave London for the west coast of Africa had on board four hundred and sixty tons of gunpowder, eleven cases of gin, ten thousand casks of rum, and fourteen missionaries." But, then, England has a National Sunday law, and acknowledges that its sovereigns reign by the grace of God, it is, therefore, according to the National Reform idea, a Christian country, and critics should keep their hands off!
