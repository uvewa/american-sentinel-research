IN 1784 a bill was introduced into the General Assembly of the State of Virginia, entitled, "A bill establishing a provision for the teachers of the Christian religion.'' About a century later, in 1889, Senator Blair introduced into the Senate of the United States a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the national Constitution *establishing a provision for the teaching of the principles of the Christian religion. *The former, if passed, as Madison said, would have been "a dangerous abuse of power." Is the latter any less so? The former, Madison wrote to Jefferson, was "chiefly obnoxious on account of its dishonorable principle and dangerous policy." This is equally true of the latter. The former was defeated because it was an infringement of our religious equality and thus subversive of American principles. The latter, with slight modifications, is re-introduced into Congress from year to year, and is now before the American people.

The similarity of the principles underlying the two bills and the objects sought to be accomplished, bring them both under the same condemnation. There is one point in comparing them, however, that is in favor of the Virginia bill; it allowed the tax to be paid to whatever society the individual taxed might desire; or, if he did not desire it to go to any it would "be applied to the maintenance of a school in the country." The Blair educational amendment makes no such liberal provision; but the taxes of the Jew, Mahommedan, Infidel and Atheist, are all to be used to teach the "unsectarian principles of Christianity," and if people do not want their children taught what the Government says is Christianity, they can suffer the consequences. And there is no telling how severe the consequences will be, for these very same persons at the same time are intending to pass compulsory educational laws that will *compel everybody to attend a school*,* be taught the Christian religion, and, what is more, pay for it out of the public treasury!* It is thus evident that the former bill was more liberal, more nearly just, and far less extensive in its consequences, than is the latter.

Both make provision for the use of money raised by the Government for the propagation of the Christian religion—the religion of the dominant cult. Both virtually say that the religious rights of the minority need not be respected by the majority. Both try to avoid opposition by making certain concessions;—the former by allowing each person to name the religious teacher to which his money is to go, and the latter by providing that the *"unsectarian* principles of Christianity" shall be taught (although the truth is, there is not a single unsectarian principle in the whole system of belief peculiar to Christians). Both violate the principles of religious equality by favoring Christianity above all other religions. The Virginia bill, Madison says, was supported by "many petitions;" so is the Blair educational amendment. The former was favored by certain sects and clergy; so is the latter. Some denominations are putting forth all the energy at their command to crowd petitions onto Congress for the passage of this and other religious measures.

The Virginia bill was defeated only by the untiring efforts of Madison, Colonel Nicholas, Colonel George Mason (drafter of the Virginia Declarations of Rights), and Jefferson, who labored faithfully during the year 1785 to circulate their adverse "Memorial and Remonstrance." In that memorial written by the future "Father of the Constitution," are stated the true principles of the American political system; and in that memorial we find the true interpretation of American institutions as established by the great statesmen of the eighteenth century. Those were the principles that were incorporated [355] into the Federal Constitution two years later.

In criticising this species of legislation Madison says "we are bound as faithful members of a free State to remonstrate against it." In declaring the reasons why such legislation is "a dangerous abuse of power," he says:—

> We hold it for a fundamental and undeniable truth, "that religion, or the duty which we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence." The religion, then, of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every man; and *it is the right of every man to exercise it as these may dictate.* This right is in its nature an unalienable right. It is unalienable, because the opinions of men, depending only on the evidence contemplated in their own minds, cannot follow the dictates of other men. It is unalienable, also, because what is here a right towards men is a duty towards the Creator. It is the duty of every man to render, to the Creator such homage, *and such only,* as he believes to be acceptable to him. This duty is precedent, both in order of time and in degree of obligation, to the claims of civil society. . . . We maintain, therefore, that in matters of religion no man's right is abridged by the institution of civil society, and that religion is wholly exempt from its cognizance. ...

> It is proper to take alarm at the first experiment upon our liberties. We hold this prudent jealousy to be the first duty of citizens, and one of the noblest characteristics of the late Revolution. The freemen of America did not wait till usurped power had strengthened itself by exercise, and entangled the question in precedents. They saw all the consequences in the principle, and they avoided the consequences by the denying the principle. We revere this lesson too much soon to forget it. *Who does not see that the same authority which can establish Christianity, in exclusion of all other religions, may establish, with the same ease, any particular sect of Christians,* in exclusion of all other sects? that the same authority which can force a citizen to contribute *three pence only* of his property for the support of any one establishment, may force him to conform to any other establishment in all cases whatsoever?
> Because the bill violates that equality which ought to be the basis of every law, and which is more indispensable in proportion as the validity or expediency of any law is more liable to be impeached. If "all men are by nature *equally* free and independent," all men are to be considered as entering into society on *equal* conditions; *as relinquishing no more, and, therefore, retaining no less, one than another, of their natural rights.* Above all, are they to be considered as retaining an *"equal* title to the free exercise of religion according to the dictates of conscience." Whilst we assert for ourselves a freedom to embrace, to profess, and to observe, the religion which we believe to be of divine origin, *we cannot deny an equal freedom to them whose minds have not yet yielded to the evidence which has convinced us.* If this freedom be abused, it is an offense against God, not against man. To God, therefore, not to man, must an account of it be rendered. . . .
> The bill implies either that the civil magistrate is a competent judge of religious truths, or that he may employ religion as an engine of civil policy. The first is an arrogant pretension, falsified by the contradictory opinions of rulers in all ages and throughout the world; the second an unhallowed perversion of the means of salvation.
> Because the establishment proposed by the bill is not requisite for the support of the Christian religion, to say that it is, is a contradiction of the Christian religion itself; for every page of it disavows a dependence on the powers of this world. It is a contradiction to fact, for it is known that this religion both existed and flourished, not only without the support of human laws, but in spite of every opposition from them; and not only during the period of miraculous aid, but long after it had been left to its own evidence and the ordinary care of Providence. Nay, it is a contradiction in terms; for a religion not invented by human policy must have pre-existed and been supported before it was established by human policy. It is, moreover, to weaken in those who profess this religion a pious confidence in its innate excellence and the patronage of its author; and to foster in those who still reject it a suspicion that its friends are too conscious of its fallacies to trust it to its own merits.
These are some of the reasons why every Christian in the land should oppose any bill whatever of the nature of the Blair educational amendment, or any other bill favoring Christianity or any other religion. It is both a usurpation of power on the part of the Government and detrimental to the religion it pretends to aid. Further on in the memorial Madison said "Either, then, we must say that the will of the legislature is the only measure of their authority, and that in the plenitude of that authority they may sweep away all our fundamental rights, or that *they are bound to leave this particular right untouched and sacred*."

Madison saw the continual tendency of public men to endeavor to legislate, in one way or another, in favor of the Christian religion. So he, in his friendliness toward the Christianity in which he believed, always used his influence against such a pernicious movement in this country. In a letter later in his life, he said that notwithstanding the general progress made by some toward religious liberty, "there remains in others a strong bias towards the old error, that without some sort of alliance or coalition between government and religion, neither can be duly supported. Such, indeed, is the tendency to such a coalition, and such its corrupting influence on both the parties, that the danger cannot be too carefully guarded against."

Yet, notwithstanding his grand work in framing the national Constitution in accordance with these principles, we find would-be reformers to-day trying to tear down this work and amend that very same document by inserting in it provisions for teaching the "unsectarian principles of the Christian religion" in our public schools! The Christian people of America who venerate the names of the noble men who obtained for us our liberties should hesitate before they give their voices and votes to eradicate the institutions which were so difficult to establish. Better, far better, will it be to throw our influence on the side of pure Christianity, by not allowing the State to have anything to do with prescribing or teaching its doctrines. Madison truly declared: "We are teaching the world the great truth that governments do better without kings than with them. The merit will be doubled by the other lesson: *that religion flourishes in greater purity without, than with, the aid of Government.*" W. A. BLAKELY.
