A GENTLEMAN at West Sunbury, Pennsylvania, sends us these encouraging words:—

"I am a Presbyterian, and worship on Sunday, and believe it to be the right day, but would force no one to believe or practice as I do. I have been reading THE AMERICAN SENTINEL for two years. It is doing a good work; God bless it."
