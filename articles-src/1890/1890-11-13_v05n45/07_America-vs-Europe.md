# America vs. Europe.

> [THE following lines—written some thirty years ago—depict from the standpoint of liberty the principles on which the United States Government was founded as compared with the principles of the European governments. The author is Count A. de Gasparin, a fearless advocate of liberty, and a warm admirer of the American institutions This extract is translated from the author’s French work; “Un grand Peuple que se Releve,” and may serve to awaken new love and vigilance for the immortal boon of religious and civil liberty.

> JOHN VUILLEUMEIR.]
THE United States is not a Latin nation; a nation clad in the robes of a Roman or Greek civilization; a nation having according to the ancient fashion, a religion and a set of customs blindly admitted by all. This Republic of the New World is not at all one of the republics of the ancient continent, where the citizens loved to talk about public affairs, but where nobody was foolish enough to raise questions of conscience respecting the public belief, pagan life,—with its compulsory worship, its uniform education, its suppression of the family and the individual for the benefit of the State; pagan life,—where the citizen supersedes the individual, and where the calm uniformity of the ages gives every one a national mold,—has no likeness to moral and social life in the United States.

Here you will not find the least vestige of that system which tries to make nations, and forgets to make men. These States can truly be said to have originated out of a protest of the human conscience. How many things are explained by this noble origin! Yes, it was the reaction of religous independence against compulsory uniformity and against the State church, that created this country, two hundred years ago. I do not need, here, to examine the intrinsic truth of the Puritan belief; I simply affirm that it landed in America in the name of liberty, and that its mission here was to establish liberty, and to build the true wall against democratic tyrannies.

At the very outset, the State was denied the direction of the intellectual and moral man. Notwithstanding the unavoidable inconsistencies and hesitancies which attend all our beginnings, the Colonies, which were to become the United States, were walking steadily on the road which leads to liberty of belief, of thought, of speech, of press, of association, of teaching. The highest, the most important rights, were stripped, at the very start, from the province of democratic deliberations; insuperable limits were laid to the sovereignty of majorities; the rights of minorities, of the individual, the right of standing alone against all, the right of being of one’s own opinion, was distinctly affirmed.

More than that, it was not very long before the bands between Church and State were completely severed, thus destroying the last pretext for the official administration of belief; *self-government *was founded, that is to say, the most explicit denial of democratic bondage. While democracy pleads for a maximum of government, American individualism pleads for a minimum of government, the *par excellence* definition of liberalism. And it did not contemplate bringing this about, as in the Middle Ages, through anarchy, absence of national ties, and by depriving the individual of his rights of conscience and thought; no, American individualism has other means of action; while restraining with a wise energy the province of government to its true limits, it was enlarging all the more the purview of the human soul.

Grand conquest that was! The whole future of our modern world is there contained.

SOME weeks ago, we printed the following item from one of our Western exchanges, together with the subjoined comment:—

> “The voice of the people is the voice of God,” is as true to day, as when spoken in a city of Greece two thousand years ago.

“Just about as true! For instance, when, a century later, the people crowded around the Son of God, shouting, ‘Crucify him! Crucify him! ’”

The item has come back to us with this question from the *Orleans Herald:—*

> Then will you please tell us what is the voice of God? Was not the crucifixion a fulfillment of the prophecies?

The word of God as contained in the Scriptures is, properly speaking, the voice of God, because it expresses the will of God; but can we believe that the unchangeable One who said, “This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased,” could also have said, “Crucify him, crucify him”? True, the crucifixion was in fulfillment of prophecy, but prophecy is simply an announcement of future events, which may or may not be according to the will of God. It is the *will* of God that “all men should come to repentance,” (2 Peter, 3:9); but prophecy tells us that all will not repent, that on the contrary, “evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.” 2 Tim. 3:13.

POSTMASTER VAN COTT has resolved to carry out the purposes of the special delivery system on Sundays as well as on other days. He considers that the public, which pays for special delivery, is entitled to it at all proper times. Hitherto it has been the custom to send out special delivery letters on Sunday morning only, by the first carriers leaving the General Post Office at 7 o’clock. In future all special delivery letters will be sent to the persons addressed in this city on Sunday up to the evening hour. This will enable those who desire to communicate with friends on important business on Sunday afternoon, and feel willing to pay the extra fee, to have their letters delivered as they desire. *—Mail and Express. *[343-344]

IN an editorial on Sunday laws, the *Colorado Graphic* says: “The people will resist these invasions of their personal rights, and with the example of other countries before them will bitterly resist ecclesiasticism. They fear the result of the union of Church and State, which means the oppression of personal liberty. As Dean Milman said, ‘In proportion as the ecclesiastics became co-legislators, heresies became civil crimes and liable to civil punishments.’ Such a result would be disastrous to the corner-stone of American independence. Our 4 great ’ dailies are cowards who fear to defend a principle in deference to an uneducated sentimentalism.”

UPON President Woodruff’s promise that the Mormons will obey the anti-polygamy laws of Congress, the *Christian Advocate *remarks:—

> Mormonism has such a bad reputation that promises to obey are suspected of covering a plan to disobey. But we are inclined to think they mean this; if so, or if not so, let them be watched. If they break no laws in this country, they have the same right to be Mormons as others have to be Roman Catholics, Spiritualists, or Methodists.

This is in refreshing contrast with the utterances of some papers which insist, not only that polygamy, but that *Mormonism* must be stamped out. But all of Mormonism, except the practice of plural marriages, has just the same right not only to exist, but to be protected, that any other ism has, and it will be a sad day for the country when this fact ceases to be recognized.

THE *Central Christian Advocate* says:—

> It is not to the public school that we must look for the religious education of our children. The most we can do in this respect, so far as the public school is concerned, is to see that all the teachers are religious men aud women. The public school cannot be maintained except as a secular school.

The *Observer* quotes this, and comments as follows:—

> The one proper place for the Christian training of children is the home. Neither the day school nor the Sunday school can fully take the place of a Christian home. Where the home is not a Christian one children are reared at a terrible disadvantage. But the same considerations which would make our schools secular, and solely secular, would certainly prevent our being able to ensure that only religious teachers should teach in them.

The first part of this paragraph is sound. “The one proper place for the Christian training of children is the home.” And it is because Christian training is so much neglected in the home that professedly Christian parents imagine that it is necessary to give, or rather to attempt, such training in the public schools. Our schools should not be irreligious, but they should be kept strictly secular, and no such qualifications as that suggested by the *Advocate* should ever be permitted to be required of our public school teachers. The State has no way of determining that one teacher is religious, and that another teacher is not, except by the profession which they make, and such professions are too cheap in these days to be of any value in such a case. Besides, such a requirement would be utterly opposed to the spirit of our institutions, and to sound public policy.

THAT “drowning men catch at straws,” is exemplified in the case of the Sundaylaw advocates. In the hearing before the Senate Committee on the Sunday Rest bill, Rev. T. P. Stevenson, D.D., said:—

> The law of the Sabbath is binding on nations and governments as well as on individual men. This obligation is recognized through our whole history by the general cessation of business in our courts and legislatures, and in all other parts of the Government on the first day of the week.

The argument which this is supposed to contain is about as weak as distilled water. Public business is properly suspended on Sunday because the State has no right to drag before courts of justice, on that day, people who regard it as sacred. The law of the State of New York likewise exempts observers of the seventh day from attendance at court upon that day; the Legislature did not, however, in enacting that law say that the State is bound to keep the seventh day; no more should it say that the State shall keep Sunday.
