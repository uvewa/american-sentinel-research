IN a recent address before the New York Baptist Pastor's Conference on "The Significance of the Roman Catholic Congress and an outline of the Roman Catholic Movement of to-day," Rev. D. C. Potter, D. D., said:—

> "That Catholic centenary congress in Baltimore was a jubilee, a Roman victory. Its first note was a pæan, its last a doxology. Its voice was defiance, its grasp power, its purpose advance, and that, dare I say, irresistible. It evaded nothing, quibbled at nothing, but spoke out in a voice dominant and daring. The Protestant church could stand on its platform with hardly a phrase change."

This is all true, especially the last sentence. But why is the last true? Is it because Rome has changed? Nay, verily; "Rome never changes." It is because the Protestant church, so called, has ceased to be truly Protestant. We live in evil times when a union between Protestants and Romanists for the purpose of moulding legislation in the interests of "religion," as they put it, but really in the interests of the dominant churches, as such, is not only possible but when it is an accomplished fact. All "religious combinations to effect political objects are dangerous," and this one is doubly dangerous because the Protestant church of to-day can stand on a Romish platform and with Romanists advocate a papal policy.
