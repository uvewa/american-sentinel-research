THE *Christian Statesman* of December 12, quotes a report of the action of Judge Ridley, of Tennessee, who is said to have declared church raffles illegal, and to have charged a grand jury "to indict all persons buying and selling tickets, and also those who in any way contributed to the management of the raffles." After stating that the judge ordered the enforcement of the law on the ladies of St. Joseph Church of Nashville, the report says:—

> "We rejoice at this step. When the professed church of Jesus Christ permits gambling, lottery, raffle, cheating, or swindling—disguised or open—in any shape, we trust that the strong arm of the civil law will fall upon her at once, for it is a shame and disgrace to the Christian name."

The action of the judge was right, because gambling is essentially uncivil. It is a form of robbery. But the report says, "We rejoice at this step"—why?—"for it is a shame and disgrace to the Christian name."

There is danger lurking in that clause. It shows that the writer and those who indorse him rejoice at the enforcement of civil law,—not because it protects the civil rights of citizens, but because they think it will help Christianity by keeping Christians from disgracing the "Christian name." Whenever the church is about to disgrace the Christian name, then these people "trust that the strong arm of the civil law will fall upon her at once." Since it is the duty of the church to not disgrace the Christian name, and since the members are subject to discipline when they do it, therefore the *Christian Statesman* and its adherents want the civil authorities to see to it that the church does her duty, and to enforce her discipline by "the strong arm of the civil law" when necessary to accomplish this end. And what is this but church and State.

It is not enough that the action be right; it must proceed from correct motives; and every time a law is enforced (no matter how good the law) from religious motives, the false principle is established in the mind that it is right to compel people by law to be religious.

[The principle stated by the writer is correct, and his criticism just as to the *Christian Statesman,* but it is only justice to say that there is in the facts stated nothing to show that the motive of the judge was not a purely civil and proper one.—EDITOR SENTINEL.]

Once established, this principle lays a foundation for the enforcement by the State of everything pertaining to a church creed. To illustrate: If you compel a man to stop drinking because you think it will ruin his soul, you adopt the principle that it is right to prohibit by law anything which in your judgment would be an injury to men's souls. This is the principle of the papacy precisely, and is the open door to all the despotism of the Dark Ages. And there is no principle growing faster in America to-day. Everywhere you will hear it said, that this law and that law, and another ought to be enforced—why? In order that people might be more civil? No, you will seldom hear that; but they will tell you they want laws enforced to keep men from going to perdition, to compel them to show respect for God and Christianity, to stem the tide of immorality and irreligion, that is hurrying men to hell. And these deluded people do not realize that, by failing to comprehend the fact that government has nothing to do with saving souls, or with keeping people from perdition, they are establishing a principle which has caused the ruin of more people than almost anything else in the world.

It is time for Americans to open their eyes and study well the principles upon which their actions are based.
