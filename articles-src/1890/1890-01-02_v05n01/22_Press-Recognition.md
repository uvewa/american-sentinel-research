WE are indebted to a number of our exchanges for friendly and even complimentary mention upon the occasion of our removal from Oakland, Cal., to this city. We appreciate these notices, not only because they are a substantial benefit, but because they show that our work has not been lost upon our brethren of the press. We are glad to know that our efforts are appreciated, and that in the final "tug of war" very many of the papers of the country will be found on the side of the liberty of conscience now guaranteed by our national Constitution.
