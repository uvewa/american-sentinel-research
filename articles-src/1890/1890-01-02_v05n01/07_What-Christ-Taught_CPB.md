Mr. HUGH O. PENTECOST, formerly a minister, now the editor of the *Twentieth Century,* a "liberal" paper, has in a recent issue of his journal this criticism:—

> "The Rev. Dr. Greer, of New York, said at the meeting of the Evangelical Alliance, in Boston, that 'sharp antagonisms have arisen between church and State, but since the Declaration of Independence Christ's own idea of a free church in a free State has been winning its way more and more.' What nonsense! Christ never had any idea of ' a free church in a free State. ' If he had, the Gospels do not reveal it."

He further avers that Christ was a "communistic-anarchist, like Herr Most." If this last had been omitted, one might suppose that the editor of *Twentieth Century *was honest in saying that Christ had no idea of "a free church in a free State;" but the latter statement marks the whole thing as malicious. Fancy Herr Most instructing one of his followers to pay a tax that he was not legally bound to pay, as did the Saviour, to avoid giving offense. (See Matt. 17:24-27.) But like too many ministers Mr. Pentecost has evidently been a poor student of the Scriptures. But it is too much to believe that he is ignorant of the fact that Christ plainly taught the total separation of church and State; and as a necessary consequence, a free church at least: for that church, and only that church, is free which is answerable only to God, and whose members recognize no authority, in morals, but the law of God. The words "Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's," brand forever and in all places as anti-Christian all efforts to unite church and State; and they also give the lie to the assertion that Christ knew nothing of a free church.

Dr. Greer is, however, in error in supposing that Christ's idea of the proper relation of church and State has been gaining ground ever since the Declaration of Independence. For a time it did gain ground, and was at high tide when the first amendment to the Constitution was adopted. No marked change had taken place when, in 1828, a committee of the United States Senate pronounced in unmistakable language against Congressional interference in behalf of any religious institution, and declared extensive religious combinations to effect political objects always dangerous. But for more than a quarter of a century the National Reformers have been making most determined efforts to roll back the car of progress; and in this they are now being so ably seconded by other and more powerful organizations that there is grave cause to fear that the next decade will witness a return to as bad or even a worse state of affairs than existed in the early days of Massachusetts. Did the present generation know the meaning of liberty, as our forefathers knew it, all might be well. But when men everywhere close their eyes to a thousand times greater danger than that which the Senate Committee on Postoffices and Post-roads saw so plainly over sixty years ago, is there not cause to be alarmed lest we lose the priceless boon of religious liberty through the sheer indifference of the masses, who forget that "eternal vigilance is the price of liberty."
