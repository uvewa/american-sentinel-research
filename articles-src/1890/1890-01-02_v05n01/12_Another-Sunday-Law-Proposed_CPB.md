WE are advised from Washington that a Sunday-rest bill for the District of Columbia will be introduced by Congressman W. C. P. Breckinridge, of Kentucky, soon after the holidays. The wording of the bill will be about the same as the national bill introduced by Senator Blair; and, like the Blair bill, will contain a clause exempting from its penalties those who "conscientiously believe in and observe any other day than Sunday as the Sabbath, or as a day of religious worship, provided such labor [as they may engage in] be not done to the disturbance of others." This, it is thought by friends of the bill, will silence the opposition of seventh-day people. In fact, referring to this very thing, Mrs. M. E. Catlin, Superintendent of the Sabbath Observance Department of District W. C. T. U., recently said: "I think that we have taken the wind out of their sails by giving them an exemption clause." We trust, however, that in this she is mistaken. Exemption clauses may make Sunday laws less oppressive to the few, but they do not make them right, nor change in the least degree their pernicious influence.

We are also informed that the plan is to urge the passage of the District bill, hoping thereby to make it easier to secure the passage of the national bill. Mrs. Bateham is credited with saying:—

> "Do little for the national bill now, but work for the local law. When we secure a law for the District it will be easy to get Congress to pass a similar law for the Nation."

To be forewarned is to be forearmed, and we trust that the friends of liberty of conscience in the District of Columbia—whether seventh-day, first-day, or no-day people—will refuse to be taken in the snare that is being so artfully laid for their feet. The passage of a local Sunday law by Congress may seem a small thing, but it would be a blow directed at religious liberty throughout the length and breadth of our land. A little more than sixty years ago Congress was asked to suspend the carrying of the mails on Sunday. The petition was referred to the Committee on Postoffices and Post-roads, of which Hon. Richard M. Johnson, of Kentucky, was chairman. In their report the committee said:

> "This first effort of the kind calls for the establishment of a principle which, in the opinion of the committee, would lay the foundation for dangerous innovations upon the spirit of the Constitution, and upon the religious rights of the citizen. If admitted, it may be justly apprehended that the future measures of the government will be strongly marked, if not eventually controlled, by the same influence."

These words, and the reason set forth in them, are applicable to the present demand for a Sunday law for the District of Columbia; and we trust that they have lost none of their force. They prevailed to defeat a scheme for religious legislation then; may they not be equally potent now?
