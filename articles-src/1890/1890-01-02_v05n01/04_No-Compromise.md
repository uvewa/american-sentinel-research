# No Compromise.

THE *Baltimore American* thinks that progress in religious liberty “has been great during the present century—greater, perhaps, than in all its predecessors combined; and it has logically followed the spread of general knowledge.” “But,” remarks that journal, “there must be more progress—very much more, too—before men learn to respect those who differ from them in religious matters, and to refrain from damnatory criticism.”

This point, it intimates, is to be reached by compromise. But this is a mistake; there can be no compromise in religion, as there can be in politics. Nothing can be hoped for in the direction of greater religious liberty, or even the preservation of the degree of religious liberty which now exists, except as it comes through the recognition of the divinely-established principle that in matters of faith men are answerable, not to their fellows, but to God alone. The true doctrine is that all men, no matter what their faith, are entitled to equal rights, both civil and social. The man who sits in judgment on another in the matter of his religion, and then attempts to punish him for what he is pleased to term “heresy,” simply usurps a prerogative of God.
