IN a recent informal talk before the W. C. T. U. of the District of Columbia Mrs. Bateham said that "the outlook for a Sunday law for the District is very hopeful. Everything is in good shape. Mr. Blair thinks that there will be little opposition this year." We believe that the Senator has reckoned without his host. There will probably be more opposition than he imagines. We are not prepared to say that Mr. Blair's Sunday-law schemes may not eventually succeed; but we do feel sure of one thing, namely, that a Sunday-law shall not be foisted upon the American people without their being fully informed concerning the nature and tendency of all such measures. The heritage of civil and religious liberty received from the founders of the republic will not be surrendered without a struggle.
