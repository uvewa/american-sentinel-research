THE Illinois Sabbath Association held its Convention in Chicago, November 20, 21. It was attended mostly by the leaders of that organization in the State. Dr. Crafts was also present. The attendance was not large aside from these leading men in the movement.

The utterances contained nothing specially new in the way of argument. But one could not help being impressed with the thought that as a company of Christian ministers they were calling loudly for civil law to compel Christians to do what it was their duty *as Christians* to do any way.

Dr. Mallernee said much of this work on the Sabbath is performed by *church members,* and the *pastors* do not *dare* to *preach against* it. The logic of this statement would seem to teach that the church members work on Sunday; if the pastors preach against it they will lose their members. Therefore let us have a law to compel everybody to keep Sunday, so our church members may be able to keep it just as well as not, and so save the pastors the disagreeable task of doing their duty. But if ministers do not now do their duty in this line; and if church members are so sadly remiss in Sabbath keeping, would it not be just as well to labor for the conversion of the ministry and church, and not spend so much time trying to make sentiment that will induce the State to compel Christians to do their supposed religious duties?

The railroads and street cars were especially arraigned for their Sunday traffic. And one would be almost led to believe that the railroads especially were a curse rather than a blessing because they made room for so much Sunday labor. In regard to these, Dr. Crafts said that the railroads are owned by *Christian men,* and what we want is something that will quicken their consciences in regard to the sin of Sunday labor. Dr. Delano said in his address that we have no Sabbath, and *ministers* and *college presidents are responsible* for it. These assertions in regard to Christians, and especially ministers, failing to do their duty were heard from the lips of nearly every man who spoke in the Convention. And we watched closely for the argument that would enable us to see just why it was necessary to ask Congress to compel all to do the duties of a Christian, in order that Christians might do their duty without inconvenience. It must be that they are trying to go in the way of a young man, who in a revival in a small town in Illinois asked the brethren to pray for him that he might "go to heaven on flowery beds of ease."

The arguments that are made against this civil Sunday-law movement were spoken of a time or two and said to be unworthy of notice, but in an evening meeting a leading man spent quite a while in endeavoring to answer these objections. He brought them forward one by one and with all the *vehement energy* of a powerful frame declared them false and really no objections at all. We waited in vain for the argument, but it was not made; to those who can be convinced by assertion his talk was, perhaps, conclusive; but to those wanting facts and arguments his speech would not commend itself. Evidently some of the arguments are troubling them and they want to either pass them by in silence or meet them with simple assertion and appeal to the sympathies or prejudices of the people.

It seemed to us that the most significant statement of the Convention was one made by Dr. Mallernee. He said, "We must rally on the secular side of this question." The secular side he thought would help to carry it through. How unfair for men claiming to be Christians to try to carry a measure in which the real issue is kept in the background, and a subject that can be made popular by appealing to the selfish motives of personal benefit pushed to the front! These men assert with indignant emphasis that they do not want religious legislation. Oh, no! But Sunday observance is a doctrine held by the Christian church, and when the Christian clergy inaugurate a movement to secure civil legislation in its favor, and then that movement is carried on almost solely by the clergy and various societies of Christians, there is room for strong apprehensions as to what will be the result if it succeeds. If their leaders exhort them to keep the "secular" side to the front, the inevitable conclusion is that they have the religious side in the background. This is the charge we make, and the logic of their own utterances is the basis of our charge, and when once their scheme is carried into effect the mask will be torn aside and religious despotism, with all its retinue of evil and superstition, will be made to appear.

That the men who are pushing this so-called reform do not realize what would be its outcome we most sincerely believe; but a little study of the philosophy of their movement in the light of history ought to convince the most skeptical what could be its only result. And would it not be well for the leaders in this Sunday-law agitation to stop to consider the advisability of returning to the old gospel methods, *pure and simple,* of *persuading* men to come to Christ, and devote *all* their energies to that? And let them first begin their work by laboring for the conversion of the *ministers* and *church members* whose spiritual condition *they* so sadly deplore, and then re-enforced by an awakened ministry and a revived church carry the work into new territory and win those to the Master who know him not. This, and this alone, is the work of the minister and the church, and it will have a better influence on the State and make its politics purer than for them to attempt to secure legislation tending toward a supposed advancement of the kingdom of Christ.
