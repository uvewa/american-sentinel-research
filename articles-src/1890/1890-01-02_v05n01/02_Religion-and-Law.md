# Religion and Law.

[This Article From The *American Standard, *San Francisco, Cal., Is A Good Illustration Of The Beauties Of Governmental Interference In Matters Of Religion, And Religious Education.]

WHAT will seem to most people a strikingly unjust decision was recently handed down by the judge of a New South Wales court. The case in brief is as follows: A father, professing the Roman Catholic faith, dies and leaves the guardianship of his daughter to his wife, also professing the Roman Catholic faith. For ten years the child is taught the faith embraced by both of its parents. At the end of the ten years the mother became a member of the [12] Church of England, to the tenets of which she held until her death, which occurred three years later. During these three years the child is a professing member of the Church of England. Upon the demise of her natural parent the child is left to the guardianship of two members of the mother’s church. At this point the father’s relatives step in and demand that the child—now perhaps fifteen years of age—shall be brought up in the faith of the father. The judge in equity held in favor of the latter.

In making up his decision the justice claimed, unwittingly and unintentionally, no doubt, that the jurisdiction of an English equity judge extends beyond the grave, beyond the confines of earth and to the domain of heaven itself. He asserted, and cited much supporting authority, that religious belief is not the result of conviction, nor developed by the exercise of the reasoning faculties. It is simply the practice in maturity of dogmas instilled in youth. He piled up authority to prove that this child’s natural guardian and teacher, its mother, had no more importance in the eyes of British law than the wooden Indian in front of a cigar store. He is, no doubt, a learned judge, and we all know that learned judges, in both Great Britain and the United States, are enabled to find any given quantity of law in support of whatever opinion they may advance. But an intelligent, fair- minded person will find it difficult to free himself of the suspicion that this English judge was influenced by something beside the law in formulating his opinion.”
