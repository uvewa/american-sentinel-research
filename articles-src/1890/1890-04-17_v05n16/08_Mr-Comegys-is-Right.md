# Mr. Comegys is Right.

THE question of religion and the State is having quite a lively discussion in this State. In a discussion between Mr. W. G. Gilstrap and Hon. George Comegys, the former rails against the latter because he is opposed to religious exercises in the Legislature and public schools. He further says that Comegys has “cast a slur on the refinement and intelligence of Washington.”

And in order to eradicate the terrible influence this slur has caused, he continues by saying, “To-day, upon the ruins of a crude, wild western frontierism stands a new-born State.” Inferring that, therefore, it is right and proper to establish religious exercises in the affairs of the State.

As a good reason for such an establishment, he asserts that this is a Christian Nation.

Hon. George Comegys answers him very aptly, in the following words:—

> The assertion is made that this is a Christian Nation. If by that phrase is meant that ours is a Christian Government I take issue at once.

> The Government of the United States is a civil Government, purely secular in its nature, looking after the civil rights of its citizens, and having no concern about their religious or spiritual affairs. This proposition is distinctly set out in a treaty made by this Government and Tripoli in 1789, during the administration of the “father of his country.” We search in vain for any intimation that this is a Christian Government, in the organic law of the land, either national or State. Mr. Gilstrap says the President takes the oath of office with his hand on the Bible. There is no law requiring or forbidding the use of the Bible or any other book in taking the oath of office. Our law requires that form of oath most binding on the conscience of the person sworn. The Chinese are sworn sometimes in this country by the decapitation of a rooster and the sprinkling of blood, that being the time-honored Confucian method of binding the pigtail conscience of Ah Sin, but it has never been suggested that by reason of that the Court was committed to the verity of that heathen rite.
