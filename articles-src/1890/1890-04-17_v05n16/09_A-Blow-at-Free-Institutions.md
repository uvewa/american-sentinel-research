# A Blow at Free Institutions.

ANOTHER move has been made upon Congress to secure the passage of what is euphemistically styled the "Sunday- rest bill." Petitions are being cooked up in many portions of the country with the same fatal facility that has characterized such deceptive devices recently in this city, and a number of them have already reached the capital, which purport to voice public sentiment. This is the most insidious and dangerous attempt yet made to entangle the Government with religion, and should meet the prompt condemnation of patriotic citizens, be they Christians or the reverse. The fathers of the republic knew very well what they were doing when they framed the Constitution. Their decision upon this matter was the result of the ripest wisdom, based not only upon the bitterest experience the world has ever known, but upon the express words of Christ—"Render, therefore, unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's." They saw stretching out behind them a long line of uninterrupted precedents establishing incontestably the fact that the union of Church and State, or the interference of either with the other, was ruinous to both, and that the zealot or the hair-brained politician needed but the frailest foundation upon which to build a calamitous superstructure of interference, so they omitted all reference to religion.

The two things are in their nature distinct, and their separation should be rigidly maintained for the good of both. Civil government is instituted for man's convenience on earth, while religion provides for his needs in another sphere of existence. The one is intended to facilitate man's intercourse with his fellowmen, the other to teach him his relations to the Almighty. The advocates of this innovation say that the better Christian a man is the better citizen he will be. This proves nothing. On the same plea the Government should regulate a man's food and his wearing apparel, his domestic relations and his business affairs, for all contribute to good or bad citizenship. So far as is known at present, the best government is that which insures the greatest freedom of action to the individual, consistent with the rights and comfort of all, and as the Government of the United States does that it is the best on the face of the earth—nay, it is the model to which the oppressed peoples of the world look with hope and hasten to adopt as the shackles are stricken from them. No single feature of it is so admirable or has been such a power for good as this rigid separation of Church and State, which gives to every citizen the absolute control of his own conscience and the right to worship God as he pleases, and on whatever day of the week he believes to be the proper one. Considered from a secular standpoint, the mingling of Church and State, of which the Sunday-rest bill would inevitably be the entering wedge, is objectionable—first, because it is an unwarrantable interference with the liberty of the citizen, and secondly, because in every country and in every age where the foundation has been laid the church has encroached upon its privileges until the State has been forced to take steps for its preservation.

From a religious point of view, the union of the two in any form is, if possible, still more objectionable. Religion exhibits to-day a more vigorous and healthy growth in the United States than in any other country on the civilized globe, obviously because here it is free as the air we breathe, untrammeled by statutes or the coercive and life-crushing power of civil authority. There is really no comparison between the religious vitality of our own people and that of the most advanced nation in Europe. So palpable is this that it has compelled acknowledgement from the highest ecclesiastical dignitaries, and the most progressive countries are imitating our example by severing as fast as possible the links which bind Church and State together. Competition, so far from being disastrous, has been a healthy stimulus to all sects and denominations, and has given that impetus to free and full discussion of religious subjects, without which nine-tenths of those who clung to the Church in the past did so in name only, without clear ideas of their duties to their Maker, or any sincere inclination to perform them. Nothing could be more detrimental to the cause of religion than the passage of the Sunday-rest bill. Many thousands of Christians are opposed to it on purely religious grounds, and millions of sincerely pious men oppose it because of the blow it aims at American institutions.—*Baltimore American. *[127-128]
