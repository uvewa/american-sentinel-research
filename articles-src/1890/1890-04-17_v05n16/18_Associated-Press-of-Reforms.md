*The Associated Press of Reforms* is the name of a new quarterly publication which the "Reform Syndicate" of this city has just launched upon the treacherous sea of polemic journalism. The whilom field secretary of the American Sabbath Union is the manager of the syndicate, and as the new paper is a "special publication for publishers and editors of periodicals," and as the matter which it contains is secured by copyright, and as the copyright articles are to be released for re-publication for twelve dollars per year, or furnished in plates at very reasonable rates, it seems that the principal object of the syndicate is to get their "reform" matter into country papers which are printed largely from plates. Mr. Crafts is, it must be admitted, fertile in expedients. [129]
