THE proposed amendment to the Constitution of the United States, offered in Congress by Senator Blair, is one of the most important and perilous propositions ever before the American people. It has been most adroitly worded and worked thus far. . . . It is a most outrageous attempt to despoil the arduous yet glorious work of our forefathers in forming a Government under which men could "serve God according to the dictates of their own consciences." It proposes the union of Church and State, and that the schools of each State shall teach a religion in conformity with this amendment to the Federal Constitution. This would not only open the gateway to the barren fields of atheism and infidelity but would cause millions to enter. The fittest place for religion is in the human heart, and not in a written Constitution. Its alliance with political power for despotic legislation will never make men religious; it may thus make cringing cowards, hypocrites, and superstitious slaves of men, but never a grateful and grand Christian.—*Welcome Tidings, Elizabethtown, Ky.*
