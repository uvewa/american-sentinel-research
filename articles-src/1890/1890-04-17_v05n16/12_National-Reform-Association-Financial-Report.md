THE report of the Treasurer of the National Reform Association, at its recent annual meeting, shows that the receipts of the society for the past-year were $7,179.13. Of this amount $5,374.01 had been expended, mostly in salaries to District Secretaries. The work of the society is not however represented by this sum, for a good deal has been accomplished by special secretaries who work without remuneration. Secretary Weir reported that he had preached one hundred sermons on National Reform topics to audiences aggregating twenty-one thousand persons.
