# Statutory Orthography.

NOT only has Mr. Lawler, of Chicago, introduced a bill providing for the adoption of ignorant spelling in the printing of public documents, but the House Committee on Printing is actually to give a hearing on the proposition. Congress is going into the business of overlooking American citizens with a vengeance.

What with Blair, Lawler and others like them, we are in a fair way of being brought up by hand, and in a session or two we shall doubtless have bills introduced regulating the corned-beef hash of the breakfast table, as to whether it shall be browned or moist; the composition of our bean soup, the amusements in which we shall indulge and the religious exercises in which we shall engage. Bringing up by hand is an ancient rite usually very disagreeable to the brought-up.

There was once a young gentleman named Pip, whose sister brought him up by hand, and the result was that the victim became heir to a convict. There are hands and hands, and on the whole we think that the Congressional hand is worse than Pip's sister's. We want none of it, and especially we want the Anglo-Saxon tongue left to itself, untouched by Lawler or his colleagues.

We want to be permitted to spell in the old, hard way, when spelling must be either right or wrong. We do not want Congress to make every man his own speller, even if the device should cover up a good deal of legislative ignorance.— *New York World.*
