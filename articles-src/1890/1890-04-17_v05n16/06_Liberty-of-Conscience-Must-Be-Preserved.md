# Liberty of Conscience Must Be Preserved.

THAT priceless document, the Constitution of the United States, declares the principle of total separation between religion and the State. It provides that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” Freedom of conscience has thus been made the foundation of our Government. Only by upholding this principle as a sacred palladium is religious intolerance kept out of our borders, and the brightest civilization developed.

This just and equal treatment of all religious denominations has been at all times a thorn in the flesh of those who suppose themselves to be the sole possessors of truth, and deem it their duty to force their views upon all. Again and again attempts have been made to Christianize our Government [117] and to introduce a State religion. Every time such attempts have been successfully defeated. But the enemy of liberty does not slumber, and continues to work zealously for the promotion of its mischievous plans. Three religious bills are now before Congress—the Blair Sunday-rest bill, the Breckinridge Sunday bill for the District of Columbia, and the Blair Educational amendment, which provides for the teaching of the principles of Christianity in the public schools.

The National Religious Liberty Association, an organization consisting of men of all denominations who are friends of religious liberty, is circulating a petition and is now represented at Washington by men whose duty it is to oppose the three religious bills above mentioned. It is the duty of every just and liberty-loving man to add strength to this movement. It is most eminently the duty and in the interest of the Jews to do all that is in their power to save the secular features of our Government and to keep the Constitution free from the embarrassment of religious intolerance.

The petition will be circulated among our Jewish fellow-citizens, and the *Tidings* hopes all will sign it.—*Jewish Tidings.*
