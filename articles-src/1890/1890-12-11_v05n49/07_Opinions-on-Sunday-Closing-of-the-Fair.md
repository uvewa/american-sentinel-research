# Opinions on Sunday Closing of the Fair.

ONE of the Chicago papers has been inviting and publishing opinions relative to the Sunday closing of the World’s Fair; the following are. a few of those opinions. We expect to print others next week:—

> Cosmogony teaches that through all nature runs a mystic seven. A mysterious, never-changing arrangement pervades everything. There seems to be always a space, a stop, a hiatus. The six days’ work and then one day’s rest is only an example in perfect harmony with the wondrous whole. All that grows is better for rest. Even machinery, they say, runs more smoothly if not kept running all the time. Sunday is to the week what the rest is to music or the period is to the sentence. We have the testimony of many employers that men are able to do as much work in six days with a day’s rest as in seven without any recuperation. A workingman has only a certain amount of vitality, and if it is spread out over seven days its force in each day is weakened.

> No one will dispute the value of Sabbath rest from a hygienic point of view, I trust, so the matter should be viewed from the standpoint of expediency. . . . The men on railroads and street-car lines, the thousands of laborers in and around the Exposition grounds, and many more, would be kept from their Sabbath rest.
> Miss FRANCES E. WILLARD.
> It is true, of course, that keeping the World’s Fair open on Sunday will keep many men at work on that day. Miss Willard is right enough on that point, but will not each of those men work of his own free will, and has he not a right to do so if he chooses? Thousands of men will be willing to do the Sunday Exposition work for the double pay that will be offered.
> WASHINGTON HESING.
> I would not even have the Art gallery opened. I would have every crack and crevice shut closely and have a sign hung out which would herald to the nations of the world that the American people, as a people, and the American Government recognize the Sabbath as an institution, the value of which is inestimable.
> REV. E. P. GOODWIN.
> A World’s Fair, a universal Exposition, is to be held in Chicago. Exhibitors from all parts of the globe are to be invited guests. The Mohammedan comes bringing his wares, he has a day which he regards as the Sabbath; he of the Semitic race has another, and we, as Christians, still another. Here are three different days of rest and worship, as sacred. It is manifestly neither fair nor feasible to force our peculiar observances upon our guests. A simple and equitable adjustment of the matter is to have the Fair open each and every day, and thus make freedom of conscience possible to every exhibitor. Let it be as in Tunis. When I was there I observed that there were three days observed each week. That is. the Christian, the Turk and the Jew, each closed his place of business and devoted himself to rest and worship on the day he recognized as sacred. The representatives of the Women’s Christian Temperance Union at the Paris Exposition closed their “chalet” on Sunday. They were not compelled to continue their Exposition on Sunday because it was possible to do so, no more than the Jew was to keep open his exhibit on our Saturday, which he regards as sacred. It seems to me that nothing less than the broad tolerance of the Fair open every day in the week will insure success.
