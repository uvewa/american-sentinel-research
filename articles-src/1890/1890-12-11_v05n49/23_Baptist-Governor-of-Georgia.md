THE *Christian Index,* of Atlanta, Georgia, comments thus upon the election of a Baptist as Governor of that State:—

> The Baptists are a very considerable folk numerically, in this State, and it is pleasant to know that they are able to contribute, from their ranks, men fitted for eminent station. Indeed the affairs of State, are often safer in the hands of a Baptist than any other, if they are true to their denominational training. This demands that they be exact and true and never for one moment seek to use power for the special benefit of their denomination. Baptists draw the line between the Church and State with a broad pen, and look with suspicion upon any trenching upon either side. The influences which Baptist doctrines have doubtless had upon our new Governor will protect the general body of the people from anything like an undue pressure from the denomination with which he is allied. So the State is to be congratulated in its chief officer, who true to himself and his principles will rule equally among all his people and in the interest of the general good alone.

If the Baptists of Georgia are as true to their principles as the *Index* expects Governor Northern to be, there will be no such pressure for the Governor to withstand.
