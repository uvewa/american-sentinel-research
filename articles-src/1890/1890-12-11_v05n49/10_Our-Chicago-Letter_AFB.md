# Our Chicago Letter.

## The Bible In The Public Schools.

THE interest in the question of the Bible in the public schools has not abated since my last letter, although a marvelous change has taken place. When the question was first introduced by the petition work of the Woman's Moral and Educational Union, the Protestant ministers of this city were almost unanimous in favor of placing the Bible back in the public schools. There were, however, a few able men in nearly all the denominations who protested in the name of justice. Nevertheless, it is safe to say that nine-tenths of the Protestant ministers of Chicago either openly favored the enforced reading of the Bible in the city schools or gave tacit consent to the movement which had that in view. It now appears that a majority are opposed to the movement.

The first radical change was made by the Baptist ministers. Dr. Hensen, one of the leading Baptist ministers of the city, and a man of national reputation, and one who had signed the petition to reinstate the Bible in the public schools, recanted and delivered a powerful address before the Baptist ministers' Monday morning meeting, taking the position that the movement was a menace to religious liberty. He settled down on the historical Baptist position of entire separation of Church and State for the good of both. The address was enthusiastically applauded and elicited no opposition.

Among the Methodists a marked change has taken place, though not so unanimous as among the Baptists. Dr. H. C. Jack- son, of the Mansfield Avenue Methodist Church, should be regarded as the pioneer in the agitation which brought about this change. As early as last spring he preached a sermon from the text, "Render therefore unto Cesar the things which are Cesar's and unto God the things which are God's," in which he argued against everything savoring of a union of Church and State. His present views of this question are the result of a careful study of Romanism, and he regards the present movement to force the Bible into State schools as partaking of the Roman Catholic idea of a union of Church and State. With these clear views of the question, it is not to be wondered at that his voice should be among the first to be heard protesting against the movement. In my last communication I stated that a resolution [390] passed in the Methodist meeting, without a dissenting vote, endorsing the movement to enforce Scriptural reading at the morning exercises in all the schools. This was the state of affairs when Dr. Jackson, Dr. Bennett, and Rev. J, P. Brushingham began the agitation of the question. Last Monday morning, Rev. Brushingham, the young and talented pastor of Ada Street Methodist Church, read a paper before the Methodist minister's meeting which was an eloquent and logical discussion of the relations of Church and State and its application to the question in hand. Through the kindnes of the author I was furnished the manuscript for publication in THE SENTINEL, but owing to its length and the fact that quotations from it would not do the author justice I have withheld it.

There was but one minister who opposed the paper on the main issue, and who argued the right of the State to teach religion, and he was so thoroughly answered by such men as Dr. Jackson, Dr. Frank Bristol, of Trinity Methodist Church, Dr. Bennett, of the Garrett Biblical Institute, and Dr. Grey, of the Freedman's Aid Society, that the principles of the paper were practically triumphant.

## The World's Fair And Sunday Closing.

The question of opening or closing the Fair is occupying the attention of all classes of society and the representatives of every phase of religious belief. The Chicago *Evening Post* recently closed a six-weeks' discussion of the question, in which all were requested to participate, and to express their wishes regarding the matter of closing, by casting a ballot either for or against. The discussion brought out the fact that there were many orthodox Christians who, while regarding their attendance at the Fair on the Sabbath objectionable, argued that they had no right to ask that the Fair be closed against those that differed from them.

It was gratifying to notice that the most intelligent agitators of Sunday closing were careful to state that they did not ask that the Fair be closed because of religious reasons, but on civil grounds only, thus showing that the principles of absolute separation of Church and State are recognized in theory, if not in practice. The ballot in the *Post* resulted, for opening on Sunday, 10,316; against opening on Sunday 5,102.

At the recent session of the Ladies' Columbian Commission, a vote was taken to ascertain the sense of the committee on the question of opening of the Fair. The ballot stood twenty-one to twenty-eight in favor of closing, many refusing to vote. Later the matter was reconsidered and the vote rescinded.

The National Commission decided to leave the matter of closing to the local committee, and information has gone out to the effect that this committee will take no action in the matter until the formal opening of the Fair. This is accepted by the friends of closing as an indication that the Fair is to be kept open, at least portions of it; the delay in deciding the question they consider to be a policy to prevent the dampening of enthusiasm in the enterprize which would result from deciding the matter either way at present.

Another one of the "signs of the times" as regards the Sunday-closing agitation was noticeable in the interest taken in a mass-meeting, projected by the Sundayrest League, which was ostensibly called in the interests of a civil rest day and which was attended by nearly five thousand people, who paid an admittance fee of from twenty-five cents to a dollar and a quarter; and the lack of interest in the recent meeting of the American Sabbath Union, whose basis is the "divine authority and perpetual obligation of the Sabbath," which was attended on an average by about twenty-five persons. It is evident from the comparative interest taken in the two meetings that the future basis, if it be a basis, for the enforcement of Sunday laws will be the need of physical rest.

## The King Case.

The practical workings of Sunday laws were recently exposed by the Associated Press Dispatch, published in all the leading papers in this city, announcing the release from jail of R. M. King, of Troy, Tennessee, on a writ of *habeas corpus.* Mr. King was imprisoned in default of the payment of seventy-five dollars imposed on him by the Circuit Court of Tennessee, and confirmed by the Supreme Court of the State, for plowing his field on Sunday. This case is now regarded with universal interest. The following is a copy of a letter addressed to Mr. King, by a well- known business man of the city:—

> MR. R. M. KING.—*Dear Sir: I* hope you will for these few lines excuse a stranger, as I never saw you and doubtless never shall as I am seventy years old and near the end of my race.

> I see by the *Tribune* this morning, which I send you, that you have been forced into an oppressive lawsuit, alike disgraceful to Tennessee and her Courts. Fight it out to the bitter end. You have the sympathy, and if necessary shall have the aid, of one who gave the life of a brave nephew at Chickamauga for the liberty you have, and must preserve. If you should deem anything I send you worthy of notice, you can address me at———where dur ing the World's Fair you will find a home beneath the roof that protects your unknown and obtrusive friend.

It would doubtless have little consoling effect on Mr. King to inform him that his past year's experience in being dragged from court to court, was the result of a "civil" Sunday law and not a religious enactment.
