# A Rabbi on Religious Liberty.

(*Concluded.*)

[A speech delivered by Rabbi David Phillipson before the late Secular Congress at Portsmouth, Ohio. Somewhat abridged.]

THE blessings we enjoy we rarely appreciate to their fullest extent, until we are in danger of being deprived of them. Full religious liberty, and freedom of conscience is one of the greatest, if not the greatest blessing enjoyed by the people of this country. . . .

We have no favored, no recognized, no State Church. There is nothing in the Constitution of the country that can be interpreted to the advantage of any one religious denomination or to the disadvantage of any other. The land has been blessed indeed during the century and more of its existence, blessed on this very account. There has been full amity and comity before the law among all religious denominations. Nor has religion suffered, for there is no people in the world in which the religious sense is so fully developed or so deeply imbedded as in the American people.

Smoothly and without friction have the wheels of the religious life revolved in all this time, but during the past year or so strange voices are making themselves heard, and fanatics, if not hot-headed, then cool-headed ones, who are all the more dangerous on that account, urging a recognition by the Government of this country of the claims of a special religion, of Christianity. There were, during the last session of Congress three measures before the legislative bodies sitting in Washington, all having the same purpose in view, the Blair Sunday bill, and the Blair Educational Amendment before the Senate, and the Breckinridge Sunday bill before the House.

These attempts may well fill us with alarm, even though these measures did not gain the sanction of Congress, yet the very fact that they were presented shows [383] that there is danger ahead, and that among a certain portion of the community (and that no small one) sentiments are abroad which are thoroughly at variance with the intentions of the founders of the Government, and with the teachings of true religious liberty; these teachings are the complete separation of Church and State, and full freedom of every individual to worship and to think as he will.... These ideas held in the closing decades of the last century; they have held during this century, but now there appears to be a retrogression; we are seemingly going back to those darker days when one religion was recognized by the State to the exclusion of others....

Listen to this sentence from a section of one of these bills: “Each State in the Union shall establish and maintain a system of free public schools adequate for the education of all the children living therein, between the ages of six and sixteen years, inclusive, in the common branches of learning, in virtue and morality, and in a knowledge of the fundamental and nonsectarian principles of Christianity.”

The fundamental and non-sectarian principles of Christianity! What are they? Those principles in which all Christians believe; a few of such principles are the divinity of Jesus, original sin, justification by faith, etc.; see you not the insidious attempt to force Christianity upon the State, and have it acknowledged as the national religion, no matter though there are hundreds of thousands who do not believe in the fundamental and non-sectarian principles of Christianity; let not that term “non-sectarian” mislead; it is not applied in a general sense, the non-sectarian principles of religion, but the non-sectarian principles of Christianity. . . .

A Government, one of whose foundation stones is this principle of the absolute separation of Church and State, may not for a moment entertain any such resolution, but it is sad to think that we have retrograded so far, that religious narrowness has found its way even into the halls of Government. What individuals do without in the different walks of life is their own concern, but when a man is elected to the Legislature of the country he becomes representative not only of the people who coincide with his private religious views, but of the people at large; and the moment he assumes these large duties, these small individualities must be laid aside, or else he is not the man for the place.

Another foundation-stone of the Government is individual liberty of action, as long as it does not interfere with the like liberty of others. This, the so-called Sunday laws tend to subvert. The Government may not officially recognize any one day upon which it prohibits freedom of action. . . These bills are obnoxious but not because they designate Sunday as the day to be particularly observed. They would be just as obnoxious if they would name the Saturday or any other day. The State may not interfere with the freedom of the individual conscience; once begun who can tell where it will end; the encroachments will grow more and more until in all probability we will get back to the old Blue Laws, which prohibited any man to walk in the field on Sunday, or to smile or listen to any music except the dreary hymns, which the gloomier they were the more religious they were supposed to be. The State has its proper work, the Church has its own sphere. “The civil power ought to be not only neutral and impartial as between different forms of faith, but ought to leave these matters entirely on one side, regarding them no more than it regards the artistic or literary pursuits of the citizens.”

Such has been the policy of the Government; it is a late day now to begin to subvert it; but I believe it may truly be said that the majority of the men and women of the land protest against even the least encroachment of the State upon the religious sphere or the smallest interference with the inalienable rights of the individual conscience and thought, and if they do not so protest it only shows that the narrow-mindedness of days that we had thought long past still exists to-day. Senator Blair, for example, is not a representative of the people, but of a class of men, who, though living in the last years of the nineteenth century, belong to the spirit of the seventeenth. They must still learn, all men and women of this kind, that sectarianism is not religion, that the bond of mankind is broader than the bond of the Church, that no single body of men has any rights, as such, over any other, and that the God of mankind is much more loving than the God they profess, who is at best only the God of a sect, all others except those who believe and think with them being placed out of the pale of his regard. This sectarianism represents the spirit that breathes in every law or resolution which is brought forward in the interest of any religion in the councils of the State; this is the spirit that dominates some of our so-called statesmen at this late day.

I would like you to contrast with these expressions the words of him whom Americans honor above all men—of Washington. With a century of experience back of them the Sunday agitators and Church-in-the- State advocates see not as clearly as did the American fathers with no further experience than their own good, common sense and their mighty intentions of the right, what are the natural rights of man, what religious liberty means. Washington was what is called a good church member, being a vestryman of the Episcopal Church; but this did not blind him to the fact that there might likewise be truth in other systems, nor did it prevent him from perceiving the necessity of keeping religion out of the State, nor of according full liberty of thought, worship and action to all.

All this is the more wonderful when we remember that these men had all been British subjects, and in no country in Europe was there closer connections between Church and State than in England; also in the Colonies in this country had there been an established Church, which was recognized by the laws of the State, all the more glory and honor to them that they should see beyond the ideas in which they grew up, as it were, and free themselves from the conceptions that were so prevalent around about them. It was a wonderful age and they were wonderful men. What clearer statement has ever been made of the religious rights of man than the following words of Washington: “Every man who conducts himself as a good citizen is accountable alone to God for his religious faith, and should be protected in worshiping God according to the dictates of his own conscience.” Let the latter-day apostles, who are now living, hear and take instruction from such sentiments. No word here about the fundamental and non-sectarian principles of Christianity to be taught to the children in the public schools, but each man should be protected in worshiping God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and not according to the rules and laws set and prescribed by men....

Religious liberty is the brightest jewel in the crown of American institutions; it has placed the man above the sectarian; it has placed manhood upon the highest pinnacle. God Eternal has created men of many minds; in nothing do these minds differ as much as in religious thought; each one unto himself, than, in this. Jew and Christian, agnostic and infidel, will find perfect peace and live in perfect harmony only so long as private convictions are not interfered with, only so long as the State will attend to its own, the Church to its own, as was the thought of the great Americans whose names we honor and whose thoughts, which are also our thoughts upon the subject in hand, may be gathered into the few terse words: “Religion must always be kept separate from civil government.”

THE pretension is always set up in behalf of arbitrary government that the ruler can do better for the people than they can do for themselves. This idea of paternalism in government was discarded by our fathers when they ordained for themselves and their posterity that they would be a self-reliant, self-supporting, self-governing people. Under our theory of government the people are no more dependent on their rulers and law-givers for their support in . their industrial pursuits than they are for food and clothing, or for their consciences and their religious creeds—*Senator Morgan. *[384]

THE Chicago *Evening Post* has for some weeks past been receiving ballots for and against the Sunday opening of the Columbian Exposition. November 15, the vote stood, for Sunday opening, 7,542; against Sunday opening, 3,301.

THE *Mail and Express* says:—

> Let the pure religious fire caught from heaven by the clean hands of the fathers ever brightly burn upon the altar of American liberty. May every foreigner, who visits our shores of freedom during the World’s Fair, return home with the conviction that true religious devotion is not only compatible with, but essential to, the highest form of individual independence, and national liberty.

But what becomes of “individual independence” if the individual is so hedged about by civil law that he has no independence?

A LONDON secular paper remarks that “it is hardly fair that a ship-owner who encourages his crew to respect Sunday should suffer in the competitive struggle,” and says that the Government should “secure for all alike the rest and quiet which in the self-governing Colonies is enforced by law.”

Commenting upon this, the *Present Truth.* an English religious paper, says: “That is, compel men who do not believe, so that those who do will have no sacrifices to make, and will not suffer in the competitive struggle. This would be compensation with a vengeance. That religious papers should be making such appeals as this is not a hopeful sign of the times. They only show how utterly antagonistic to the spirit of the gospel is the spirit of Sunday laws and all other religious legislation.”

REV. NATHANIEL W. CONKLING, D.D., writes a letter to the New York *Observer*,* *descriptive of Alaska and some of its people, in which speaking of the Metlakahtla Indians, he says:—

> These so-called Indians are Christianized. Mr. Duncan acts in the belief that to educate them without Christianizing them is to give them a bane rather than a blessing. All information goes to show that they are consistent Christians. In this Sabbathless country, every Metlakahtla Indian who makes a contract to work in mines, canneries, or forest, insists on the distinct agreement that he does no work on Sundays.

Who can doubt that these Indians are altogether more self-reliant and better able to meet all temptation under such circumstances than they would had they been hedged around with a Sunday law, and required to keep the day to avoid arrest and imprisonment? The fact that these Christianized Indians keep Sunday in a country where there is no law requiring them to do so, shows that others could keep it also if they were only sufficiently Christianized to be willing to practice a little self-denial, and suffer loss if necessary, rather than violate their conscientious convictions of duty.

‘THE history of Protestantism has nothing to boast of over Catholics,” says the *Catholic Review.* “They know very well—at least some of them do—that we can more than match them in every charge they bring against us, especially in the charge of persecution for conscience’ sake. If we were so disposed we could appeal to the whole history of Protestantism, and especially to that of our Puritan forefathers, to prove conclusively that the country is in danger of the supremacy of that element.” This is all too true; but it don’t prove that persecution for conscience’ sake is right. It is equally evil come from what source it may. Intolerance masquerading as Protestantism is just as wicked as when wearing the badge of Rome.

IN the United States District Court, November 4, Judge Hanford rendered an opinion in the suit brought by Catholic Bishop of Nesqually to obtain the title of 340 acres of land occupied as a military reservation by the United States Government at Vancouver, Wash. The claim brought by the plaintiff is based upon the establishment of a missionary station at Vancouver with consent of Hudson Bay Company. The property is now estimated to be worth nearly $1,000,000. The Court holds that the claims of the United States Government to the lands, as a reservation, is prior in time and for that reason, if no other, superior in equity to that of plaintiff. An appeal was taken to the United States Supreme Court. This is simply history repeating itself; favors once granted the Roman Church have invariably been subsequently demanded as rights; and in this respect many so-called Protestant bodies are not one whit behind Rome.

THE *Christian Advocate*, referring to the Louisiana Lottery, says:—

> It takes from New England more than three million dollars annually. It draws over long distances and its drafts are immense. How much does it return? If it did no other mischief than swallow the people’s millions without yielding any adequate return it might be endured. The demoralization of consciences and manhood which it produces is infinitely worse.

This is a very common but a very erroneous idea. The legitimate business of the Government is to protect the persons, property, and reputation of its citizens; and to do this properly requires the prohibition of such swindling concerns as lotteries.

The fact that lotteries are demoralizing does not justify their prohibition. The same argument would justify the suppression of a great deal of literature with which probably even the *Advocate* would not insist that the State should meddle. When the State begins to regulate morals there is no place for it to stop short of absolute paternalism with all its objectionable features.

THE *Independent* has the following:—

> A colporter of the American Bible Society, Penzotti, has been imprisoned in Peru, near the capital, for circulating Spanish Bibles. At the latest advices he had been lying in jail two months awaiting trial. It was his expectation when he last wrote that he would be sentenced shortly to four months or a year’s imprisonment. The only crime of which he was guilty, so far as the American Bible Society has learned, was that of selling Bibles. It seems incredible that such a case should occur in any of the South American countries, and particularly in a State like Peru. In Argentine and in Chili full liberty of worship is allowed, but not yet in Peru nor in Bolivia.

Yes, it does seem strange that such an outrage upon human rights can be perpetrated in this enlightened age anywhere outside of Russia—or rather it would seem strange did we not know that in more than one State of our own glorious Union, honest, industrious, and God-fearing men have within the present year been imprisoned, not for selling Bibles, but for reading the Bible and obeying it just as it reads rather than as expounded by the dormant religious sects.

A LITTLE pamphlet on the Sunday question has reached our table. We are at a loss to understand why a man who professes to reverence Sunday should use such suicidal means. The book begins by claiming that the day is a *religious* Sabbath, but ends up by the oft-repeated assertion that it is not; that it is a *civil* Sabbath. The argument simply overthrows itself. It is a new form of the story about the Irish woman who didn’t want to lend her tub:

“A tub is it! Sure an’ I niver owned sich an article,” and seeing a doubtful expression on her neighbor’s face, added, “An’ baysoids, wasn’t it Mrs. O’Rafferty that borried it jist this blessed minit?” *—Moral and Scientific Companion* [385]
