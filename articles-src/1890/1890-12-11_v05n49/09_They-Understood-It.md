IN reply to an invitation to send representatives to the late Conference of the Protestant denominations of the State of New York, called by the Presbyterians to discuss the question of moral instruction in the public schools, the Baptist pastors assembled at Lockport, adopted the following resolutions:—

> We believe that it is a manifest injustice to tax those who do not believe in religion, for the maintenance of schools in which are taught religious principles which they do not wish their children to learn; and further, the inauguration of such a system of religious teaching in our public schools forms a valid argument for the division of the school funds with those who might not relish such teaching, thus resulting eventually in State support of schools in which the creed of Agnosticism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Judaism, or Romanism might be taught.

> We believe that the State ought not to teach religion, because this would mean, in our age, religious instruction by unregenerate persons who do not know what true religion is, and whose instruction would, in a large degree, be marked by hypocrisy, formalism, irreverence, and error. We do not wish such persons to instruct our children religiously. The State should teach only that on which all are agreed, and should not invade matters of conscience or religious opinion. If the State may teach religion in schools the State may teach religion in churches of her own establishment. It is only on this broad ground that we can oppose those who would subtly instill Romanism or the creed of Agnosticism into our public instruction.
This answer though plain was, it seems, misunderstood by those to whom it was sent, for in his account of the Conference in this city, Dr. Payson said:—

> The Baptist Pastors' State Conference declined the invitation in a resolution, unanimously adopted by a rising vote, in which the secular view of the functions of civil government was vigorously set forth. . . . It is plain that in some way the Baptists misunderstood the object of the Conference, for the Presbyterian Synod of New York and the General Assembly would never have taken a position in this matter inconsistent with the Presbyterian form of Government (Chap. I., sec. 1.), or with repeated utterances of both of those bodies protesting against any union of Church and State, and they are in accord [389] with the Committee which called the Conference.

To this, a Baptist pastor makes reply as follows, in the *Examiner* of November 20

As a member of the Committee which presented the resolutions, I wish to say that the Committee thoroughly understood the position of our Presbyterian brethren, as set forth by Dr. Payson, and that, after reading his letter in the *Examiner*, still wish our resolutions to be interpreted literally.

We are sorry that any one should infer from our utterance that we believed the Presbyterian Synod advocated the union of Church and State. It would hardly be a fair inference. What we did say was this: "If the State may teach religion in schools, the State may teach religion in churches of her own establishment;" thus pointing out that the principle underlying State instruction in religion in public schools is the very principle which underlies State churches. To protest against the one and to advocate the other is a position dangerously inconsistent.

Dr. Payson fears that our Committee failed to get the distinction between "religion" and "sectarianism," and understands us to say, "The State shall not invade matters of conscience or of religious (sectarian) opinion." Now, we meant just what we said. We did not understand the Synod as advocating sectarian instruction in the schools. We object to that, and we object to any sort of religious instruction by the State. We cannot agree with Dr. Payson, that the State should teach in its public schools "the existence of God, and the responsibility of the human soul to him here and hereafter." We most thoroughly believe these truths, but we do not believe they have any proper place in public school instruction. Dr. Payson tells us that "these truths are common to all sects and distinctive of none." We think he is mistaken. The sect of the Infidels, of the Agnostics, of the Buddhists, and of the Necessitarians do not accept these truths in the sense in which the Presbyterian Synod understands them. We may not agree with these unbelieving friends of ours, but they have their sacred rights, and one of them is the right of freedom from taxation in the support of public schools in which religious tenets obnoxious to them are taught, and another is the right to public instruction for their children, without the necessity of having forced upon them doctrines they do not believe. We claim these as our rights. Has not the Infidel and the Agnostic the same rights? Or does it make a difference whose ox is gored?

We believe with Dr. Payson that these truths "are the indispensable foundations for the morality which belongs to wholesome citizenship," but that does not prove to us that they ought to have a place in the public school curriculum for we believe, too, that faith in Jesus Christ is the essential thing in building up the best character in the citizen, and surely no one advocates putting the teaching of that into our public instruction.

It seems strange that Dr. Payson should say, "If the State cannot teach these fundamentals of what we consider true morality, it would better not teach at all." Surely education, general intelligence, and culture have a value independent of religion. Religion is the great good, but there are some other good things too, viz.: water, steam, civilization, gentility, honesty. Why should the State not teach arithmetic, geography, reading, and writing, even if it does not give didactic instruction in morals? In short, we believe that, as citizens we should do all in our power to divorce the public schools from politics, and to secure the appointment of pure-hearted persons as teachers, but we do not believe the State should give formal instruction in morality. Let that be taught in the home, in the church, by the personal influence and character of the public school teacher. Is it said that many have no such instruction at home or at church? Very well, let the Church redouble her efforts and not call on the State to help her out.

We take this broad ground for two reasons. The ordinary public school teacher is not competent, intellectually, to teach morals. And again any thorough teaching must involve moral philosophy to a greater or less extent. The questions must come, "Why ought I ? " and "Ought I always to follow my conscience?" and "What do you mean by conscience?" These are questions on which learned and Christian men radically disagree. On such subjects, I wish to instruct my own child. I do not care to be forced to unteach at home what is taught in the school.

Just one more point. Are all Christians agreed about the "existence of God and the responsibility of the human soul to him here and hereafter"? The God I worship and love is a very different being from the God of the Hyper-Colonist, of the Unitarian, or even of the Romanist. Nor do I believe in the milk-and-water God of the sentimentalist. Surely Dr. Payson does not suppose that he can confine discussion on the existence of God in a schoolroom full of questioning children to the bare fact of being. The children will ask what sort of a being he is, and will get their answer too, sometimes from an infidel teacher, sometimes from a Unitarian, sometimes from a Romanist or a Jew, and the practical effect will be either dead formality or the spectacle of a set of unregenerate and ignorant people teaching theology. I shall keep my children at home if this plan succeeds. And when we go on to moral responsibility to God, involving, of course, the matter of rewards and punishments, would it be possible to avoid a teaching of universalism, restorationism, annihilation, second probation, purgatory, and what not?

I have written this letter with the highest appreciation of the Christian character and generous courtesy of Dr. Payson, but I cannot agree with him. I should say in closing that I do not pretend to speak for our Lockport Committee, but I believe I have in the main expressed their sentiments.

> Yours truly.

> FREDERICK L. ANDERSON.
