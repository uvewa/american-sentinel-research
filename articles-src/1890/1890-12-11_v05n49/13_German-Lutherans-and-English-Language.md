THE *Lutheraner*, of St. Louis, Mo., thus defines the attitude of the German Lutherans toward the use of the English language in their schools:—

Not only has the English a place in the curriculum of our schools, but it is treated as a second mother tongue, and in a number of branches is the medium of instruction. It may be that here and there in the country districts this plan is not fully carried out; but these are exceptions to the rule, the removal of which is our constant endeavor.

The synods which urge the duty upon parents of having their children educated in the Christian schools, at the same time emphasize the duty of providing such instruction in English, that the children may be able take their place in a community in which the English is the prevailing language. When it comes to statistics, it may turn out to be that, on the whole, the public schools accomplish no better results in the English than do the parochial schools. The German Lutherans are opposed to the Bennett law, *not because it demands a certain amount of English,* but because this law is a gross interference of the State in the domain of the Church.

For, according to the Bennett law, it is possible to compel parents to educate their children in the public schools, where no religious instruction is imparted, even if the children in the parochial schools know three times as much English as the law demands. [391-392]
