ON a recent Sunday evening, a prominent Sabbath Union orator was holding forth to a small audience in a church in this city; on the opposite corner Gilmore's band was discoursing sweet music to a crowded house. The situation was not to the orator's liking, and, in the bitterness of his soul, casting a sad look upon his handful of hearers, he remarked, "If you would close up that synagogue of Satan over there you would have more people in here." And that desire—the wish to fill the churches—accounts for the milk in the American Sabbath Union cocoanut.
