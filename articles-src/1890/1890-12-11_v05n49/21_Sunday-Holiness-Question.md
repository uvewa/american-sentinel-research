A GENTLEMAN, of Alabama, recently wrote to the Albany *Law Journal* asking: "What legally-constituted tribunal ever decided that one day in the week was more 'holy ' than another? If so on what authority?" The question was called out by the remark of the *Journal* that a man who shaves on Sunday "cheats the Lord out of his time." The *Journal* responded

> We really are not competent to answer the inquiry, and we turn the inquirer over to the *Independent,* which is much better informed on the point than we are. The idea of the "Lord's time" is simply a notion which we hold in common with a good many other superstitious people.

The *Independent* also evidently felt unequal to the task of answering the question, for instead of discussing the query, it launched out upon a long justification of Sunday laws upon so-called civil grounds. Why not answer the question and tell the Alabama man where, when, and how Sunday was made holy?
