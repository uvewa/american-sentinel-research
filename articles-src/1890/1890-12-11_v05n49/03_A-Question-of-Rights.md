# A Question of Rights.

THAT the Roman Curia and the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church are intensely hostile to the public school system of this country, is a fact that requires no demonstration. Comprising, as the Roman Catholics do, about one-ninth of the population of this country, and open as the mass of the Roman Catholics are on all sides to the influences of a Protestant environment, they clearly perceive their danger and have resolutely addressed themselves to the work of mitigating it.

The especial aspect of the question that concerns Protestants and Catholics at the present time, is that presented by the public schools. These schools as established in the different States are in the main nonsectarian: and as no distinctively religious instruction is imparted in them, they are by the Roman Catholics called “godless schools.” In order to offset the danger to the Roman faith of having the children attend these public schools, the Roman Catholic authorities establish parish schools of their own; and it is the command of the high church authorities as voiced at the Plenary Council recently held at Baltimore, that such schools be established in every diocese, and that the children of the church be required to attend them. This order of the Plenary Council is being carried out in the different States. The action of the Roman Catholic Bishop of New Jersey has, however, led to the introduction in the Legislature of New Jersey, of a proposed amendment to the Constitution of that State prohibiting any local power from compelling or preventing the attendance of children upon any particular school, —the object being to prevent the church authorities from commanding the children to attend parochial schools on pain of denial of the sacraments.

With every sympathy for our public schools, and opposing to the fullest extent the division of school money between Protestants and Romanists, it does not appear to the *Christian at Work* that New Jersey should enact any such prohibitory statute. Yet argument is advanced in favor of this legislation; and we have not seen so strong a presentation of the case for the amendment anywhere as in that put forth in one of the ablest and best of our secular papers—*Harper’s Weekly.* That journal puts the matter in this wise:—

> The members of the Roman Church, like other American citizens, are protected in their civil rights by the Government. One of these rights is the choice of schools for their children, and any other citizen or combination of citizens interfering with that right, whether they call themselves priests or churches, may be justly restrained.

Plausible as this may seem, we cannot accept it as conclusive or satisfactory. For the statement in *Harper’s Weekly,* quoted above, to our view involves the fallacy that one class of rights can be guaranteed to the exclusion of another class: that is to say, Roman Catholic parents are to be guaranteed in some way the right of sending their children to the public school in defiance of the church to which they have promised allegiance, but the church authorities are not to be guaranteed the rights of administering ecclesiastical government in their own way; in fact these rights guaranteed since the establishment of the Government, are to be suddenly extinguished by an amendment to the Constitution of the State. This we take it is the position occupied by the advocates of the proposed constitutional amendment, and by journals holding the view on this question maintained by *Harper’s Weekly.* To such a position the *Christian at Work* is unable to assent.

And here let us take a hypothetical case by way of illustration. In Louisiana, as is well known, the lottery is legally established, and any one has the right to buy a lottery ticket—a right presumably guaranteed by the State. Well, it coming to the knowledge of certain Protestant churches that some of their members are investing in this lottery, and as the church authorities hold, to their spiritual injury, the authorities hold a conference, and as a result declare that the membership of these churches are prohibited from buying lottery tickets, with the admonition that those who do will be expelled from the church. Now, will it be claimed that the State may in equity prohibit these church authorities from enforcing their prohibition by withholding the sacraments from the offenders? Admitting that there is the widest possible difference between the public school and lotteries, it is yet to be noted that by one party the schools are regarded as “godless,” as by the other party the lottery is held to be devilish. Yet shall liberty on the part of the church to deal in the one case be denied and in the other case allowed? May churches not exercise their ecclesiastical functions in the one case, but have full liberty to do so in the other? If so, we have no information as to the grounds upon which this discrimination is exercised by the State.

This journal, it is not necessary to say, believes thoroughly in the public schools. It wishes every Roman Catholic child might attend them; it believes thoroughly in compelling Romanists to pay their full school tax, *nolens volens.* But just here, as it seems, the province of State authority ends. The Roman Catholic Church has its rights, just as Catholic parents have theirs. If these parents are not willing to send their children to the parochial schools let them send them to the public schools, as many Roman Catholics of New York are doing, and abide the consequences. But for the State to step in and interfere as between the clergy and the laity of a religious sect, is to infringe upon guaranteed rights, interfere in matters with which it has no rightful concern, and to establish a dangerous precedent. The less we see of this interference on the part of the State, the better for the cause of religion and religious liberty, and the better for the State itself.—*Christian at Work.*
