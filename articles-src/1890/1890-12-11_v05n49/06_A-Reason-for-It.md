THE Sunday-closing law of Denver seems to be a dead letter.—*Salida Mail.*

No Sunday-closing law can be made a live letter. We have studied the subject for thirty years from personal observation, and know the history of the fanaticism for a century. No ecclesiastical law has ever been successful. Its failure is most pronounced, however, when the law applies to every vocation in life. Saloon and barber-shop closing have both been tried in Denver, and both have fallen under the pressure of public disapprobation. Now try to close drug stores and confectioneries and bakeries, and stop the street sale of newspapers. What result would you look for, particularly in large cities? Revolution? Yes, and very decided revolution. There are several reasons for this sentiment. One is the growing spirit of liberalism in religious matters. Another, the fact that this Government was founded on equal rights and personal liberty. Another, that hundreds of thousands of citizens believe that the Lord ordained the seventh, and not the first, day of the week for his worship and for rest. These believers, in the true spirit of the Declaration of Independence, must be protected in their belief—personal liberty, equal rights; and no one church—no one dogma—no one priesthood—no one ism should prevail against another. The Church and the State must forever remain separate in the United States of America, or down goes the proud structure.—*Colorado Graphic.*
