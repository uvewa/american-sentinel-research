THAT the adoption of the National Reform creed is that which is demanded by the Conference on moral instruction in the schools, is evident from the following from Rev. G. S. Payson's account of that meeting:—

> The first address, delivered by Professor George R. Crooks, was a most eloquent and persuasive presentation of the reasons why morals should be taught in every public school in the Union, and why reverence for God and responsibility to him should in every case be made the basis for such instruction. . . The State is divinely ordained; it is a moral being, and the subject of a moral government, for we hear of "a corrupt State," and of "the just retribution which may be visited upon a State;" all this the State should teach.

And yet we suppose that the gentlemen who demand that this instruction be given at public expense, would to a man insist that it is purely non-sectarian. It must be that only that which the other fellow believes is sectarian; "that which I hold myself is the 'simon-pure,' unadulterated article absolutely essential to that morality which is absolutely essential to the well-being of the State."
