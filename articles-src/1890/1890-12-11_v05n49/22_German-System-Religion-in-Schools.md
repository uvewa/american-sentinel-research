AT a recent Teacher's Institute in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, the subject of religion in the public schools was discussed. "Dr. Noss," says the Pittsburg *Dispatch,* "paid a high tribute to the German system, which he said cultivated the pupil's thinking powers, physical powers, and moral powers. He did not think that the Protestant teachers should be greatly offended when their Catholic contemporaries speak of the godlessness of the public schools. He was of the opinion that religion should go hand in hand with secular training, and that the result would be that the moral education of children would be greatly furthered."

Superintendent Luckey took issue with Dr. Noss in regard to religion in the schools. He said that if intense religious instruction would produce a nation of infidels like the Germans, he did not want religious instruction in American schools. It was impossible, he. said, to give secular and religious instruction in the public schools.
