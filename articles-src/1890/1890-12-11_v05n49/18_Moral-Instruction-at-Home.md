REV. DR. WILLIAM T. MELOY, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, Vinton, Iowa, says: "Keep the Bible out of the schools and our children are deprived of moral instruction." This might be true of Dr. Meloy's children, but we are persuaded that most ministers give their children moral instruction at home; indeed we do not see how it could be true of any children in *Christian* homes. Homes in which moral instruction is not given are not Christian, even though the head of the house may publicly minister in sacred things.
