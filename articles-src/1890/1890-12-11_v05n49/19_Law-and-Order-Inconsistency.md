THE Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, *Press* of the 23d ult., has the following editorial notice of the late Law and Order Convention in that city:—

> Although the Law and Order Convention has been condemning in unmeasured terms the "desecration" of Sunday in any manner, including the running of railroad trains, yet all the delegates to the late Convention here, save three, left the city last night or this morning. Some went last night to distant cities, so they will be traveling all day Sunday, while others did not even make a pretense of avoiding a start on Sunday, but leave Pittsburg this morning. It is possible the gentlemen do not consider that they are amenable to the moral laws they expounded so diligently all the week. They may think that anything that they do is sanctified by the fact that *they* do it, and that the wicked engineers, firemen, conductors, ticket-sellers, and other railroad officials who are forced to labor that the Law and Order people may reach home, are absolved because they are doing evil in a holy cause.

> This may be the way the Law and Order delegates look at it, and then again, perhaps they do not give the matter any thought at all. The general public, however, will wonder at the presumption and inconsistency of those people who dare to condemn others for sins they commit themselves.
The *Press* should understand that the Sunday-law advocates want Sunday laws in order that they may not be tempted to travel on what they regard as sacred time. In short they want civil laws to restrain them from sin, just as the judicious mamma puts the preserves upon the top shelf of the pantry in order that Johnny may not be *tempted* to pilfer them.
