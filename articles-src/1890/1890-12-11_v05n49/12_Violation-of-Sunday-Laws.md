At the present term of the court Judge Young had some cases before him, presented by the Grand Jury, charging certain merchants with violation of the Sunday law. This is the second term of the court within eighteen months, at which the violation of this law has been called to the attention of the court. At the first term the fines imposed by the court were nominal. At this ter m the court sentenced the parties violating the law to fines as high as fifty dollars, and costs. It is to be presumed that Judge Young intends not only to punish those who may violate the law, but to deter others from violating it. This manner of enforcing the law, will secure its observance in this parish.—*Tensas *(*Louisiana*)* Gazette.*

It would be well if at our next term of court an investigation should be made into the prevalent way of keeping the Sunday law in this parish.

There is a good deal to be said against this law, but if the Government of the country is to take charge of the morals of the people, then the Sunday law should be rigorously enforced everywhere. In fact there seems no reason why the New England "Blue Laws" should not be revived and put in force.—*Madison *(*Louisian*a) *Journal.*
