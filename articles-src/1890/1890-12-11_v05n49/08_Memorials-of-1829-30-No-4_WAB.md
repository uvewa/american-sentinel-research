# Memorials of 1829-30. No. 4.

## A Protest From Sabbatarians.

IN the Sunday-mail agitation sixty years ago, the Sabbatarian Christians were not asleep any more than they are now. Among the memorials sent up then and preserved among the public documents of the Government is one signed partially by them. Thus we see that these seventhday people, though small in numbers, have always made themselves felt when religious liberty was endangered. The truth is, that in all the world's history, it has been the small and unpopular denominations—the dissenters and "heretics,"— that have done most for religious liberty. For this reason, if for no other, these small sects should be encouraged by affording them equal protection and privileges with the dominant sect, that we may ever have a people jealous of the least infringement upon our liberties, and fully alive to the danger when the first attempt is made to encroach upon our natural and constitutional rights.

The remonstrance was from New Jersey, and reads as follows:—

> *To the Honorable, the Senate and House of Representatives in Congress Assembled:*

> The subscribers, inhabitants of the county of Salem, in the State of New Jersey, respectfully represent:
> That your memorialists belong to various religious denominations of Christians, and some of them are conscientious in the belief that the *seventh* day of the week, commonly called *Saturday,* is the *true Sabbath;* that they have learned with regret that attempts are simultaneously making in different sections of the country to get up petitions and memorials to Congress to pass a law for stopping the United States mail on Sunday. While your memorialists acknowledge, with the most devout reverence, that "the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof," and do most solemnly disclaim all idea of "robbing Jehovah of the worship which is his due,'' as Christians and republicans they are constrained to remonstrate against the passage of such a law, which they believe would be pregnant with serious evils to our country. We are of the opinion that the report of the committee of the United States Senate of the last year, on this subject, is conclusive, and that the first article of amendments to the Constitution which declares that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press," has virtually prohibited Congress from legislating upon this subject.
> In the opinion of your memorialists, errors of opinion, whether of religion or politics, may be safely tolerated in our country, and no *surveillance *is required to control them other than that of "reason, a free press," and "the free course of the gospel." From the judicious arrangement of the Post-office Department, there is no reason to dread any disturbance of religious societies in their devout worship on that day; and the passage of such a law would, in the opinion of your memorialists, by occasioning *numerous expresses* and other modes of conveyance, defeat the *ostensible* object of the law itself. Such a measure would be the result of a "zeal not according to knowledge," and is not warranted by the benevolent spirit of our holy religion, which is "gentle," and not coercive; which is "without partiality and without hypocrisy;" which inculcates an *active* benevolence; which discovers to us a Deity who delights not in "sacrifices and vain oblations," but in the offering of an humble and a contrite heart, and whose goodness is over all his works.
> The proposed measure would tend to circumscribe and restrict the benefit of a free press, which is the palladium of our liberties, and to check or retard the diffusion of knowledge, which, in the order of Providence, is the surest means of spreading the gospel, and would obscure or render less refulgent "the light of Bethlehem's star." Works of mercy, and of private and public necessity are always excluded from the general prohibition. The divine Author of our religion has shown us, by his own example, that it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day. The proposed measure would lessen the good man's opportunities of doing good. Many religious tracts, pamphlets, and newspapers "devoted to the interest of Zion and the prosperity of the Redeemer's kingdom," are transmitted by mail; and why not "mail carriers," equally with "illiterate fishermen," become the heralds of salvation? Why attempt to restrict or limit the Almighty in the methods of his grace? To stop the mail would, in the opinion of the memorialists, be repugnant to a wise maxim, which applies to morals and religion, as well as to economics, "not to put off till tomorrow that which can be done to-day," and would resemble the conduct of "the slothful servant who hid his talent in a napkin."
> It is an invaluable privilege, for which, as Christians and republicans, we cannot be too thankful, that the Constitution of the United States guarantees to every one the rights of conscience and religion; and, in the opinion of your memorialists, the proposed measure would operate as a violation of these rights; *would be made a precedent for others of the same kind, and more alarming;* would pave the way to a union of Church and State; against which our horrors are excited by the awful admonitions of history; which would be the deathblow to our *civil* and *religious liberties,* purchased by the virtue and valor, and sealed with the blood, of our fathers; and end in the worst of all tyranny—"an ecclesiastical hierarchy."

> *January 20, 1830.*

Well they knew, as people always ought to know, that human nature is ever the same; and if the ecclesiastics to-day had been in the places of the ecclesiastics a few centuries ago, the sufferers would not have fared much better. If you want liberty, never place a tyrant over you and then trust to his liberality.

W. A. BLAKELY.
