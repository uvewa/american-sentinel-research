# Individualism.

THE last Legislature of this State passed an act relating to married women, which reads as follows:—

> A married woman shall have a right of action for injuries to her property, injuries to her person or character, and injuries arising out of the marital relation, in all cases in which an unmarried woman or a husband now has a right of action by law. A husband shall not be liable in damages for his wife’s wrongful or tortious acts, nor for injuries to person, property, or the marital relations caused by the acts unless the said acts were done by actual coercion or instigation of the husband: and such coercion or instigation must be proved in the same manner as any other fact is required to be proved: but in all cases embraced in this section the wife shall be personally liable for her wrongful or tortious acts.

This statute is in the line of numerous other acts passed by the Legislature of this State with reference to married women, the design of which is to put a wife, as to legal independence and responsibility, on the same footing as that of her husband, or as that of an unmarried woman. Under the old common law the wife was largely a mere chattel, and had but few rights and only a very limited protection. Her personality, so far as she had any, was chiefly merged in that of her husband, who virtually owned her, just as he owned a horse. She could neither sue nor be sued. She really had no legal personality attaching as a status to herself. The legislation of this country has for years been sweeping away this antiquated nonsense and injustice, and giving to married women their proper rights as persons, and holding them to their just responsibilities. The move is in the right direction.—*The Independent*

Such legislation is to be approved for the reason that it tends to render those affected by it self-reliant and self-governing. But it is strange that while our law makers see the evil of merging the personality of the wife into that of the husband, they apparently see no impropriety at all in the State’s swallowing up the individuality of both men and women, making the State everything and the individual citizen nothing.
