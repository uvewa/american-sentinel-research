THE following extract, from the *Congressional Record,* is submitted as an evidence of the subtle dangers which may be concealed in the most seemingly innocent measure, if it involves any illegitimate or unconstitutional legislation.

The extract is from the debate on the Senate bill for the "more complete endowment and support of the colleges for the benefit of agriculture," etc., which passed the House, August 20:—

> *Mr*.* Blount*.—Will the gentleman allow me to say in the reply to the last suggestion, as to the constitutionality of this question, is not that a thing of the past? And I would also ask if there is anything in this bill providing for this system except what has already been anticipated, and is existing law to-day?

> *Mr. McComas.*—That is the whole of it.
> *Mr*.* Blount.*—For instance, you have got your colleges based on the land scrip of 1862, and you have your experimental stations based on the act of 1887, and as I understand it, the effect of this bill is simply to increase the amount appropriated, from $15,000 to $25,000.
> *Mr. McComas*.—That is the whole scope of this bill.
> *Mr*.* Blount.*—Therefore we are not confronted here with the question as to whether we are adopting this or that system, but we have it now, and this is just to extend its operations.
> *Mr. McComas.*—And that is all. It is to appropriate more to secure some more schools in the new States.
> *Mr. Blount.*—But the principle is already in the law.
> *Mr*.* McComas.*—And not only the principle but the practice, the practice of all the States in the Union. And this simply increases the amount, and adds to the number of schools of like character.
This same method of reasoning was used in the Senate and House, during the debate on the appropriations for the maintenance of religious schools among the Indians; it was used in the discussion of the Breckinridge local Sunday bill, for the District of Columbia, before the House Committee on the District of Columbia; and also at the hearing in the last Congress upon the Blair Sunday-rest bill, before the Senate Committee on Education and Labor.

It does not require a very extended observation of the course which legislation is taking in this country, and of the opinions expressed in legislative halls, to see how it is possible within a few years that laws of a strictly paternal or ultrareligious character may come to their passage, and all protest be totally ineffectual, because the "principle is already in the law"—"and not only the principle but the practice."
