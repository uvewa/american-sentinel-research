# Liberty of Conscience.

PUBLIC attention is being called to a recent attempt to enforce a rigid Sunday law in Tennessee. For the first time since the establishment of our Government, will the Supreme Court of the United States be called upon to decide upon the constitutionality of the laws requiring compulsory observance of special days as sacred days. As we have no established national religion, of course a Mohammedan who abstains from business on Friday, which is his Sabbath, or a Jew who similarly abstains of a Saturday, or one of the Baptist divisions that also keep Saturday as a Sabbath, can be made to observe Sunday only by the same sort of unjust law that once made it a crime to read an English translation of the Bible.

For the protection of the great body of the American people who observe Sunday as a day of worship, the law may properly require that no unnecessary noises or other disturbing proceedings shall be permitted near places of worship during worshiping hours. To pass beyond this line, is to manifest a discrimination as to religious belief inconsistent with the toleration our purely secular system of government is bound to observe. The religious world can make rules for the conduct of its own people, but when they attempt to enforce those rules by the power of the law, they are usurping an authority inconsistent with the spirit of our Government, and are requiring an outward conformity which is without, or against, personal conviction. Such enforced conformity is also inconsistent with the spirit of Christianity, for that requires the willing obedience of heartfelt service, given freely from personal faith and sincere conviction of duty.

Let the Christian, rather by what he does than by what he says, commend religion and its sweet and beautiful observances to the esteem and admiration of the world. “Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.” To force Christian observances upon reluctant minds is to cleanse the outside of the platter, to arouse the spirit of antagonism, and to compel the assertion of human liberty, which led Martin Luther to say that before he would submit to a sabbatizing of Sunday, he would play on that day, jump on it, dance on it.

This compulsory mode of exacting Sunday observance is a departure from the mild and persuasive influence that Jesus required. “Ye know not what spirit ye are of,” he said, when some of his disciples in their excess of unwise zeal, would have had recourse to harshness. To command and enforce compliance with religious duties is to depart from the genius and essence of Christianity.—*Jessamine Journal*,* Nicholasville*, *Kentucky*,* July 25*.
