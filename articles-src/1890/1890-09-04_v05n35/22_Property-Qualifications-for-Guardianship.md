A FEW weeks ago, a five-year-old boy was run over, in the streets of this city, and had both his legs crushed. Subsequently his father made application to one of the courts, to be appointed guardian for his own child, for the purpose of bringing a suit for damages, in behalf of the injured boy. The father's application was denied, on the ground that he was not worth fifty dollars. It was shown that this father was a sober, industrious man, but that made not the slightest difference; he lacked the necessary property qualification, and could not, under the law as interpreted by the court, be permitted to enter suit in behalf of his minor child. Comment upon such a law is unnecessary. Every lover of justice and liberty will be able to characterize such a law himself, better than we could possibly do it. To say that it belongs with the most objectionable kind of class legislation, and that it is monstrously unjust is to put it very mildly.
