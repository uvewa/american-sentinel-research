REFERRING to those who demand the abolition of capital punishment, because of the scenes accompanying the first electrical execution, in this State, the *Christian Advocate* says: "They may succeed, for this is an age of sentimentality and 'legislation by hurricane.'" This agrees exactly with the utterance of the *Christian at Work* concerning Sunday laws, namely, that such laws "are undoubtedly based upon feeling, rather than laid along logical lines." This is true; we have legislation by clamor, and trial by clamor, and too often the only thing back of the clamor is a sickly sentimentalism as utterly foreign to sound reason as ice is to equatorial Africa.
