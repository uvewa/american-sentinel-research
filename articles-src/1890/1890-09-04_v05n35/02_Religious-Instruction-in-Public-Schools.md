COMMENTING upon the action of the late Presbyterian General Assembly, in re-affirming the declaration of the Assembly of 1870, in regard to religious instruction in our public schools, the *Independent *says: "The Assembly did not define what this instruction should be; and if it had made the attempt, it would thereby have proved the unwisdom and impracticability of the idea in our public-school system, existing under the authority of the State, and supported by general taxation. The radical difficulty on this subject consists in determining what religion shall be taught at the public expense."
