# The National Reform Idea of Government.

THE National Reform theory of government is, that, instead of deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, governments derive their powers directly from God. “The powers that be are ordained of God,” is a text often quoted by them. What they understand by it is shown by the following paragraph from an article by Rev. R. C. Wylie, in the *Christian Statesman,* of June 12.

> To the State belongs the power to define . marriage, to declare who may and who may not marry, and for what cause divorce may be granted.

It is strange, indeed, that one who is jealous for the honor of God and for the authority of his law, should take such a position as this, for it is utterly subversive of all moral government. If *Cod* has given to civil government the authority here indicated by Mr. Wylie, it at once becomes the duty of all, to accept the authority of government as final upon these questions, and to govern their acts accordingly. It is no longer necessary that any one should ask, what does the word of God say upon the subject of divorce? but what does the government say? and having complied with the requirements of the civil authorities, he would be free from the claims of all law, both human and divine; for having delegated certain authority to government, God could not, and would not hold subjects responsible for the abuse of that power by those whom he had appointed to rule over them.

The truth is that, while the State does properly regulate marriage and say for what cause divorce may be granted, and while it is the duty of the Christian to comply with whatever marriage laws the State makes, in the matter of divorce the Christian must be governed only by the law of Christ. That is, the law of the State permits divorce for many causes, but the law of God permits divorce for only one cause; and the Christian must not take advantage of the law of the State in this respect, but must obey implicitly the law of God as laid down by Christ. If the Christian has Scriptural ground for divorce, he may seek it through the proper legal channels provided by the State; if he has not Scriptural ground he must not seek a divorce at all, even though he may have abundant civil statutory grounds.

This shows that the State has nothing whatever to do with interpreting and administering the law of God. Every man must answer for himself to God; which would not be the case if the State was permitted to come between the individual and God. In that case men would be responsible to the State, and the State to God; there would be in that case no direct accountability to God; the citizen would inquire, what does the State say? and knowing and doing the will of the State, the individual would be free. But such is not the plan of God. He has ordained civil government to regulate the civil affairs of men, and in civil matters men are responsible to the State; but in morals, men are answerable alone to God. He is the only moral governor, and his law is the only moral law. C. P. B.
