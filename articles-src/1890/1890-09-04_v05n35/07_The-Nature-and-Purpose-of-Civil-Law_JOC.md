WHAT is the nature of civil law? One writer has defined civil law as "the collective organization of the individual right of legitimate defense." It being true that every man has received from God, the right to defend his person, liberty, and property, it follows that any number of men may legitimately concert together to organize a common force for mutual defense and protection. In other words, law is the substitution of collective force, for the rightful force of individuals, in order that each may be guaranteed the safety of life, liberty, and property, and maintained in all his natural rights. This is necessary, in order to preserve the peace and safety of the people.

But the dignity of a State can only be preserved when its statutes are executed, as otherwise all authority and order in the Government would soon be dissipated. But a legislative enactment without a penalty, could not be enforced, for the reason that such an instrument would be nothing more than a suggestion, and could have no more weight than a mere opinion expressed. Men might or might not adopt such suggestions, as they saw fit, without molestation. But when a legitimate enactment provides that those guilty of violating its requirements shall be liable to a penalty, it makes no difference if certain ones in the State do disagree with its sentiment, they must fall into line, and obey the statute, even though it be against their will, or else suffer the penalty which the statutes provide.

Civil law is a legal remedy for injuries inflicted, no matter how slight such injuries may be. Were it not for the law, there would be no redress for any wrong. Public sentiment may condemn injury and insult, but it is not a substitute for the law, as it cannot remedy the matter. Its decision may be salutary, yet daily infringed. A principle resting only on public opinion, may be violated until it is not considered of any moment. Macaulay has truly said that "nothing that is very common can be very disgraceful. Thus, public opinion when not strengthened by positive enactment, is first defied, and then vitiated. At best, it is a feeble check to wickedness, and at last it becomes its most powerful auxiliary."

It is for this reason that law is necessary, because, where checks are fewer crimes are greater. But this is force; for were it not for the fear of suffering the penalty, no more heed would be given to the law, than as if it had no existence. Sometimes, as in the case of laws against selling intoxicating liquors, men violate them, expecting to pay the penalty, because they consider it more advantageous to themselves financially, to suffer the inconvenience of the penalty when not considered too heavy, than to obey the law. In view of this tendency, penalties are frequently provided, which are very severe, in order to deter from the violation of the law, and so preserve the authority of the State.

It is plain, therefore, that the operation of law is the operation of force, since men are obliged to comply with its provision or be punished. But for this very reason, civil law cannot properly prescribe positive duties for men, and require the performance of those duties, for the reason that civil government has not the prerogative of punishing men for the neglect of positive duties, because that would be to interfere with men's personal rights, with which a civil government properly has nothing to do. It is an indefeasible right of all individuals to use their faculties and powers as they see fit, and to any extent, in the improvement of their minds or in the accumulation of wealth, provided, however, that in their pursuits they have due respect to the rights of others, by making no offensive or restrictive attacks upon those rights, or anything which concerns them.

The law may punish for all breaches of the public peace. The only question to settle on this score, would be to determine what constitutes an offense. There must be a general agreement that every act of injustice by one citizen toward another, would come under this head; but, in matters of religion, what would constitute an act of injustice? It would certainly be unjust to permit interference with one's act of devotion, of whatever it may consist, whether it is public or private, so long as that devotion does not in any way injure another in person, property, or reputation. The Government may, and ought to have laws preventing such injury, because thereby the public peace is endangered. But the Government cannot go beyond this, and require a religious observance on the part of any one, no matter how creditable in itself such an act of worship might be, because that would be an unwarrantable invasion of personal rights, since God has given no one the privilege of deciding for another whether he shall or shall not worship.

Since all law is force, it cannot, therefore, go beyond the domain of mere force. When the law, by force, restrains a man from injuring others, it simply imposes on him a negation. In this case, it does not attack his person, liberty or property, but only protects others from the injustice of his attacks. The law then, is not made to *create justice*, but to *restrain the injustice* that naturally exists. In the absence of injustice, the opposite would come in without force. The office of law, therefore, is to restrain wrong, rather than to enforce the right. Just as soon as the law commences to act positively, it substitutes the will of those who framed the law, for the will of the citizens. When this is permitted, the intelligence of the citizens becomes a useless possession; their personality and liberty are gone; they need no longer have anxiety about the responsibilities of the future. In short, they would cease to be real men, but grown up children instead, when the laws are framed so as to prescribe their positive duties.

It is for these very reasons that civil law cannot recognize religion, or decide its requirements. We repeat that law is *force;* and whatever positive duties it requires, are forced duties. Therefore, where religion, in any of its forms, is required by law, it is a religion forced upon men, whether they will it or not. Yet it would not do for the law to be opposed to morality, for in that case, it would compel the citizen to accept the cruel alternative of sacrificing his ideas of morality, or his respect for the law. This would be as unjust as the other extreme of the law, prescribing the duties of religion for the citizen.

All, therefore, that civil law can properly do toward religion and be just, is to respect every form of religion, and favor none; to be neither hostile nor friendly to any, but simply be silent on the subject, as a matter lying outside of its jurisdiction. The reason for this is obvious; and the principle is admirably stated in the following words from "Church and State," by Dr. Schaff:—

> "Freedom of religion, is one of the greatest gifts of God to man, without distinction of race and color. He is the Author and Lord of conscience, and no power on earth has a right to stand between God and the conscience. A violation of this divine law written in the heart, is an assault upon the majesty of God in man. Granting the freedom of conscience, we must, by logical necessity [277], also grant the freedom of its manifestation and exercise in public worship. To concede the first, and to deny the second, after the manner of despotic governments, is to imprison the conscience. To be just, the State must either support all, or none of the religions of its citizens."
