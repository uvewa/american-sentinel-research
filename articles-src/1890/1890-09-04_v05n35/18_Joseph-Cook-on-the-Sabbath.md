JOSEPH COOK says: "I hold that the Sabbath is recognized in the Constitution of the United States, for the President is required to sign bills within so many days Sundays excepted. Every one of us is entitled to the same day's rest that he is. Still, so far as the State is concerned, I do not believe in enforcing the religious observance of the Sabbath, but only as a day of rest and quiet."

But there is no law to *prevent* the President from signing bills upon Sunday if he desires to do so. There is, whether Mr. Cook acknowledges the fact or not, a vast difference between *forbidding* a man to do work on Sunday, and providing that he shall not be *required* to do any. California recognizes Sunday more fully than does the Constitution of the United States, and yet, Mr. Crafts and Mr. Cook, as well as a host of lesser Sunday-law lights constantly complain that that State has no Sunday law. They would not be satisfied with a statute declaring Sunday *dies non.*
