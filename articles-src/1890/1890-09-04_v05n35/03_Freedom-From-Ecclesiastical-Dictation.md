THE people are getting tired of officious intermeddling with the freedom of thought and belief, from persons who would rule the minds and bodies of others in the name of religion. And while there is so much said by Protestants against Catholic rule, there is one thing very certain, that while all religions are tolerated in this country, the people would not submit to the government of any one of the Protestant denominations sooner than to the Catholics. We are a free people, to think and believe at will, without dictation from any ecclesiastical source whatever. Our Government says, "Think and believe for yourselves, but hands off in religious matters."—*Judge Barlow.*
