IN a recent appeal in behalf of that society, Ida C. Craddock, Corresponding Secretary of the American Secular Union, says: "How mistaken is your action in refusing to join the army of the American Secular Union, which is waging the only organized warfare against these would-be uniters of Church and State!"

Has the Secretary never heard of the work of the National Religious Liberty Association? With all due deference to the Secular Union, we must say that in the single year of its existence, the Religious Liberty Association has done more effective work against the "would-be uniters of Church and State," in this country, than the Secular Union has ever done in twice the time, or ever can do; and this, for the simple reason that too much of the work of the Union takes the form of opposition to religion; while the Religious Liberty Association bases its opposition to Church and State union, upon the inalienable right of every man to profess any religion or no religion as he may elect, and that, absolutely free from any sort of State interference.
