A SAN FRANCISCO paper remarks that "the advocates of Sunday laws should 'brace up' and know something. Mrs. J. C. Bateham, who flourishes the sesquipedalian title of 'National Superintendent of the Sabbath Observance Department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union,' said in a lecture here, last Sunday evening, that the Sunday newspaper was a Sabbath desecration in that it compelled editors, reporters, and printers to work on Sunday. Mrs. Bateham ought to inform herself that the work done by these Sunday workers is for the Monday morning edition, which a strictly enforced Sunday law would make impossible, as it likewise would the reporting of her lecture and the sermons of the clergy."

Nobody that knows anything about newspaper work, supposes that the objection to Sunday papers is because of the Sunday work done upon them. That plea is simply chaff used to decoy unwary sparrows. The real objection to Sunday papers is that they are read on Sunday, and that the reading of them is supposed to keep people away from church.
