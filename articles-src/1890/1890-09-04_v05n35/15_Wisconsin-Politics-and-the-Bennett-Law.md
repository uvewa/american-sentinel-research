GOVERNOR HOARD has been renominated and the Bennett law re-affirmed by the Wisconsin Republicans. The Democrats have nominated Geo. W. Peck, and declared against the Bennett law. The action of the Republicans in indorsing the Bennett law is to be deplored, for it is certainly unworthy of the support of either of the great parties.
