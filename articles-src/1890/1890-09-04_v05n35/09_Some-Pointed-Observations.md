IN commenting editorially upon a recent Sunday-law sermon, delivered by one of the pastors of Oakland, California, *The Dial* of that city, says:—

The Doctor assumes that all persons outside of prisons are not at liberty to work or not to work on Sunday, as they please, in communities and States where there are no Sunday laws. He also intrudes an ingeniously sentimental appeal as between the rights of the workingman and the millionaire, as respects resting on Sunday—an appeal *ad miserecordiam*, as the logicians call it—to the lachrymal glands, as it were. As a matter of fact, under the present State laws, or the defect of them, on the Sunday question, millionaires sometimes work on Sunday. So, also, many poor men choose occupations in which they work on that day and receive the extra wage for that additional day's work. If they do not so choose, no law obliges them to do so, no more than any law can compel seven days' wages for six days' work in favor of any poor man. But we think we can answer the good Doctor's pathetic interrogation more specifically. We think we understand something of the spirit of the laws of this State. "When" he asks, "will California enact suitable Sabbath laws, etc. ?" We believe it will be when the intelligence of California ceases to regard "Sabbath laws" to be in violation of the civil liberties of the citizen—when it ceases to regard "Sabbath laws" to be in violation of conscience—when it ceases to regard the demand for "Sabbath laws" to be inspired by the religious zeal of one portion of the community, for the purpose of enforcing its peculiar observances on the other. It will be when California, instead of representing, as she does to-day, in the spirit of her laws, the advanced principles of American civil liberty, retrogrades to medieval methods for the persecution of opinion and the support of a semi- theocracy?

Our reverend townsman, like so many of his brothers of the cloth, talks feelingly of the "emancipation" of the workingman, but he gives himself entirely away in his appeal for "*Sabbath"* and "*Christian*" legislation. These pious gentlemen do not take the trouble to analyze their motives too keenly, flatter themselves that they mean well, but, as a matter of fact, they mean religious persecution, and they do not mean a great deal else. They simply want to force their neighbors to conform to the "Christian Sabbath," whether they religiously respect it or not. There are multitudes of good citizens, without highly colored religious convictions, who have quite as much regard for the rest and welfare of the "poor workingman" as these professional representatives of good will to men, and who have a great deal more regard for the principles of American liberty that protect saint and sinner alike. They have more of Christian charity, even; for they would defend with their lives the religious liberties, even, of their would-be persecutors—including those of the "Christian Sabbath"—and this they would do because they are Americans.

Professional religionists, like our reverend fellow-townsman, appear in these days to be afflicted with an increasing forgetfulness that they are living under a civil government, instead of a theocracy, and that there are in this country other classes of citizens whose rights of opinion and observance are quite as sacred as their own. . . .

They forget that there are even large religious bodies among their fellow-citizens, with convictions as sincere as their own, like the Jews and the Adventists, for whom the enactment of "suitable Sabbath laws" would be downright persecution; as such laws have already proved themselves to be in several of the "sisterhood of States"—in that precious land of religious liberty, Tennessee, for example! These orthodox gentlemen, not content to enjoy the freedom and privilege of Sunday worship for themselves, would have the first day of the week changed in color for their fellowmen, by the powerful analine of religious conviction. Conscious of their own growing weakness to accomplish this, they resort to the medieval method of calling on the civil laws to help them out.
