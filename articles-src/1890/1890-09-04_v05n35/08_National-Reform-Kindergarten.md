# National Reform Kindergarten.

THE Young People’s Society of Christian Endeavor, which recently held at St. Louis, the largest convention ever gathered by any religious society, has been formally received into the *coterie* of religious bodies, associated together as the National Reform party. The *Christian Statesman*, hereafter, will devote a column in each issue to the Y. P. S. C. E. The Young Men’s Christian Association is now the only organization of moment, established for a professedly moral purpose, which has not sold itself to politics and forsaken true religion, pure and undefiled, for the great deception in the religious world of this day.
