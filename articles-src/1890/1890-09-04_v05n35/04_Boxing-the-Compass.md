# Boxing the Compass.

THE question of religion in the army, is yet undisposed of by Congress, and may fail of settlement because of its intricacy. The following is from an editorial in *The Churchman:—*

> Nowhere do the evils of a divided Christendom appear more glaringly, not even in heathendom, than in the army, where one gospel is so much needed and would be so affective. It is urged by some, that Congress has no constitutional power to provide chaplains, and that the existence of such officers is in direct contravention of that article of the Constitution which forbids any provision for an establishment of religion. But if the practice, under an instrument from the date of its origin, be any clue to its true meaning, this objection fails. There have been chaplains both in the army and navy, and in both branches of Congress itself, since the present Constitution was adopted, and before;—since the Declaration of Independence. Moreover, if the Supreme Court should rule this objection valid, the public conscience would at once demand an alternative to the present system, for nothing is more certain than that this Nation is Christian. The question of religion in the army cannot be evaded, however it be postponed. It is related of a former adjutant-general, well known to churchmen, that having constructed the chapel of the Soldiers’ Home at Washington, on good ecclesiological principles, he proceeded to furnish it with a Protestant Episcopal altar and the chancel furniture; and that, objection having been made that three-fourths of the old soldiers were Roman Catholics, he built another altar, at the opposite end of the chapel, and fitted the seats with railroad backs. The story is so good and illustrative of this writing, that the general must pardon this use of it, though it should be an “invention.” But if all the “divisions of Christendom” had demanded equal rights, the general would have been driven to call in the admiral to box the compass for the orientation of his transepts. This is practically the problem now before Congress. That it is “before Congress” will appear from the fact that the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, meeting in Omaha, took formal action to promote the cause of religion in the army, and appointed a committee of distinguished men, to petition Congress and to invite the co-operation of other religious bodies to the same end. Several of these have cordially responded by action of their highest councils, the General Convention being one of them; besides the independent action of several diocesan conventions. Three or four bills to this effect lie on the table of the present Congress, the main purpose of all being a demand for-“a chaplain in every post.” There are now thirty chaplains to a hundred posts.

What is the problem, according to the above extract, which is now practically before Congress? It is to so skillfully box the religious compass of naval and military religion, that its points of doctrinal direction shall correspond to those of all the “divisions of Christendom,” [260] which, may be represented in those branches of the public service. If, then, Congress has in hand the problem of naming, in their order, all the points of the religious compass, and providing means by which each man in the employ of the Government may be enabled to face his own particular denominational altar, the sea of controversy upon which the ship of State is about to be launched, will be found to be the identical one described by Sinbad the Sailor, in which the mutual attraction of the lodestone islands will draw the ship apart, and distribute its wreck equally, to every false magnetic pole in this troubled sea of religious controversy.

Such will be the result, if the ship of State voyages on such a sea, so manned and navigated, with a ship’s compass accommodated to the magnetic pole of every lodestone island in the theological chart.
