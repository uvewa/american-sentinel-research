THE *Pearl of Days* says that, "the Catholic clergy of Los Angeles, California, have joined with other citizens in the following petition:"—

> To the Los Angeles City Council:

> The undersigned earnestly petition your honorable body so to amend or enlarge our city ordinance that the saloons shall be closed not only on election days, but also on Sundays. In this movement, for the moral benefit of the people, we wish the public to understand that we are influenced by no political partisanship.

> FRANCIS MORA, Bishop.

> J. ADAM, Vicar-General, and all the other Roman Catholic clergymen of this city.

This is not to be wondered at, since the Baltimore Council declared in favor of *high license* and Sunday closing. The two measures are cut from the same web, namely, compromise with the saloon. They alike delay the final abolition of the evil.
