"THE school question," says the *Catholic Review, *"is breeding difficulties with every hour. Following the troubles in Massachusetts, and Wisconsin, comes the news from Ohio, that a Catholic pastor in Toledo, has been indicted by the Grand Jury, 'for misdemeanor, or for neglecting to report pupils to the Board of Education.' There is an Ohio law, a meddlesome, impertinent law, of the same stamp as the Wisconsin Bennett law, conceived in the same spirit of malice, envy, and hatred, which requires all schools, public and private, to make a regular report to Boards of Education in each district, of the names of the pupils, ages, and so on. Acting under legal advice, the Toledo priest refused to make such returns from his private school, and his consequent arrest will test the constitutionality of the law, and make trouble for Ohio fanatics. These irritating questions are going to multiply." [281]
