# Unfamiliar Reasons for the Rest Day.

IN recent numbers of the *Christian Statesman,* Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts has published a series of articles, in which he has exercised his skill in inventing numerous reasons for Sunday laws. One of these “unfamiliar reasons” he gives under the sub-heading, “The Weekly Independence Day,” and concludes thus:—

> Laws setting apart a weekly “Independence Day” are no more inconsistent with liberty, and much more essential to it, than the law of an annual Independence Day.

What analogy is there in the case? The law of the annual Independence Day gives every one the liberty to observe it in whatever civil manner he chooses, or if he choose, not observe it at all. Is that the sort of law he wants for a weekly independence day? Not at all. He wants all to be compelled to observe it, and that in a prescribed way. Such a law as he wants would subvert the very principle of our national independence, as expressed in the immortal Declaration. This declares that all have an inalienable right to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” But a Sunday law, such as National Reformers seek, would deprive many of the liberty of pursuing their own happiness, even in the most quiet, peaceable, and harmless way, one day in every seven, while it would rob those, who are compelled by conscience to keep another day of the week as a sacred day, of one-sixth of their time in which to labor for an honest living. We conclude that Mr. Crafts’s “reason for the rest day” is not only “unfamiliar,” but illogical, unjust, and subversive of human rights, as set forth in that matchless document, the Declaration of Independence.R.
