THE purpose to thoroughly secularize the Government of Brazil, is shown in the provisions of the new Constitution, making civil marriages compulsory, prohibiting any support of the Church by the State, the control of cemeteries by any religious bodies, the teaching of religion in the public schools, the residence of Jesuits in the country, and the founding of new monastic orders. It will now be in order for National Reformers and Roman Catholics to unite in denouncing Brazil as " atheistic," and her statesmen as the "enemies of all religion."
