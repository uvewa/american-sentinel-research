# Where Shall They Go?

A CHICAGO paper says: “A large element in the urban population is ignorant, industrious, struggling with poverty, and trying to keep its children in school. Its evenings are dim and weary. What are its Sundays? The women go to saloons in many instances—in far greater numbers than godliness on the avenues would like to believe possible. Where else have they to go? One of the ministers proposed a few years ago even to close the parks Sundays. The children of these poor people go to the parks if they can, as soon as the hot weather sets in to stay. The homes of these people are simply pens of distress. They are too close for reading, even if the families are disposed to read; and happily the distributing stations of the public library supply a great proportion of them with books. They have no music to speak of. Of course they have no pictures, or engravings or etchings, or aught that refreshes a weary eye and opens vistas for imagination to carry off into ideal happiness the victim of social depression. This element in the population of all American cities is annually increasing, and in Chicago it is far larger than is generally supposed.”
