THE *Christian at Work* says: "Our Sunday laws are undoubtedly based upon feeling rather than laid along logical lines." Yet in the same connection it attempts to justify the enforcement of such laws! Referring to this fact, a Western paper says: "Logic is reason; therefore to say that Sunday laws are not laid along logical lines, is to say that there is no reason in them. And in this age of boasted enlightenment, people will plead for rigid laws, against reason. The pitiful part of the matter is that while the laws themselves are based upon feeling, they are usually enforced with a total lack of feeling."
