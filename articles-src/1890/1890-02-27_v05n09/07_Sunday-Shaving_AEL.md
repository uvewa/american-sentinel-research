THE local barbers' union of Detroit, Michigan, have made an appeal to all Christian pastors and people, asking them to lend their assistance in the effort the union is now making to close the barbershops of the city on Sunday. The appeal sets forth that the journeymen barbers are now compelled to labor three hundred and sixty-five days in the year, keeping such unreasonable hours that they are wholly unable to enjoy any social or religious privileges.

It is no doubt a great grievance for the barbers, or anybody else for that matter, to be compelled to work seven days in the week. But we are not aware that there is a law in existence requiring any such amount of labor; and we do know that there *is* a law which requires them to rest on Sunday. Why, then, do they not take their rest? The fact that these men work seven days in the week shows that they have no regard for the Sabbath commandment, and consequently they are not religious. The query at once arises, Why was this appeal made to the preachers? They are not the law-making power in the nation. Why should they make an appeal to those who profess to be religious to help them in securing that for which they have no regard, and which they already possess? That is like the boy picking up stones in the meadow. He said that he was looking for something he did n't want to find.

These barbers claim that they want social and religious privileges. But there is a law which grants them all the religious privileges they could reasonably ask for, and there is another law which if enforced, would absolutely require them to take their Sunday rest. But as they pay no regard whatever to the right which they have to rest on Sunday, nor to the law which requires them to rest on that [70] day, it is clear that this appeal is made with an altogether different object in view than that of securing *religious* privileges. Isn't this about it: they want to enjoy the privileges of a weekly holiday without the annoyance of thinking that their customers are being shaved by their neighbor barbers. In other words, they want to enjoy what they are pleased to call social and religious privileges at some one's else expense. They would have us to understand that it is impossible for them to enjoy their co-called social and religious privileges, unless those who forego these privileges, for a business profit, are required to enjoy them too. How would it be if our barber friends should desire to attend a religious meeting, or go on an excursion on some other day of the week than Sunday? Must they needs make an appeal to the preachers to help them in securing a right which they already possess?

Again, should they take a day out of the week for recreation or religion, they expect to be at the expense of that day's work; and whatever profit would accrue to them from the business of the day, were they at their places of business, they expect to go into the hands of their competitors. Why, then, are they not willing to grant to their competitors the same privileges on Sunday that they grant to them on other days of the week under similar circumstances?

The plea is often made that the workman cannot retain his place without working on Sunday. But if he thinks his eternal salvation depends on his keeping Sunday, and yet he labors on that day for fear of losing his situation, it shows that he thinks more of his situation than he does of his salvation. So far as this world's goods are concerned, religion is the most expensive thing in the world; for it requires all that a man has, and any man who is not willing to give all that he possesses for his religion, even to his life if necessary, ought to be ashamed to ask assistance in securing what he calls religious privileges at some one's else expense. And further, the preacher who would render any such assistance is unworthy of his calling.

But how do the preachers regard the appeal? Rev. C. R. Henderson of the Woodward, Avenue Baptist Church, on Sunday evening, December 22, took a very strong stand in favor of assisting the barbers to secure the object of their appeal. He said the law of the State very properly prohibited it (Sunday shaving), and he believed that the glory and advancement of our people was due more "to the legal recognition of the Sabbath than to anything else." The State does indeed prohibit Sunday shaving, but very improperly as we think. We had supposed that the one object of the State was to protect men in their belief, whatever that belief may be, even if it consists in unbelief of some of the practices of the Christian religion. And there is no good reason why they should not be protected in the honorable discharge of their business on any day of the week. But when the State takes upon itself to say that one day of the week is more sacred than the rest, and to dictate which day of the seven that is, and how it shall be observed, it has taken upon itself a work that does not belong to it.

Dr. Henderson says he believes the glory and advancement of our people is due more to legal recognition of the Sabbath than to anything else. We had supposed that glory and advancement in an individual or a nation, so far as this world is concerned, are seen in the stand which they take in defense of human rights. But any State that requires the recognition of Sunday, or of any other religious institution, is performing an inglorious action and is taking a long step backward toward the superstition of the Dark Ages. It is taking its stand in defense of human wrongs.

If these barbers think that the observance of Sunday is essential to their salvation, what an opportunity is here presented for them to gain glory and honor by voluntarily refusing to labor on that day even at the risk of losing their situation! What an opportunity is presented for rebuking "those who lay claim to a certain amount of goodness," as Mr. Henderson expresses it. He says: "If those who lay claim to a certain amount of goodness would do this (cease to patronize the shop on Sunday), Sunday work would be made unprofitable, and when that condition is reached the evil will be corrected." It would seem from this that the profits arising from keeping the shops open on Sunday, comes from "those who lay claim to a certain amount of goodness;" because if their patronage is withdrawn, the business will "be made unprofitable." The sin then of keeping the barber shops open seven days in the week, lies at the door of those who lay claim to a certain amount of goodness (whoever may be meant by that term), for they are the ones who create the demand. In suggesting how the object of the barbers might be secured, Mr. Henderson proposes not to preach to them the exceeding sinfulness of the thing, but instead, to make their business unprofitable, and so compel them to be righteous by making it unprofitable to sin. But the only reason why they keep their shops open on any day of the week is because it is profitable. No doubt they would close them altogether if it did n't pay to keep them open; consequently if the barber shops should all be closed on Sunday the only conclusion we can draw would be that it does n't pay to keep it open, and not that the owner is a Christian.A.
