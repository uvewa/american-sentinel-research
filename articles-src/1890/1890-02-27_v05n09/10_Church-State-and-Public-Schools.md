*The Colorado Graphic* remarks that "the renewal of the Blair Educational Amendment Resolution and Sunday-rest Bill before the Fifty-first Congress is causing many thoughtful men to reflect seriously as to the proper relation of the Church and the State, and religion and the public schools."

*The Graphic* also says that "Sunday special laws are religious laws and unconstitutional. To ask for religious legislation is to degrade religion and weaken its influence. Christ taught this. The word of God teaches it from Genesis to the Revelation." [71-72]
