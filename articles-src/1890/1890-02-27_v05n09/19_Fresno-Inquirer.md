THE Fresno (Cal.) *Inquirer,* a live newspaper published in the metropolis of the San Joaquin Valley, has a "Department of Church and State and Temperance," ably edited by N. J. Bowers, a former contributor to the columns of the AMERICAN SENTINEL. We are glad that the secular press not only in California, but very generally throughout the country, is waking up to the importance of this question; and this is the more encouraging from the fact that a large majority of the secular papers are opposed to so-called National Reform, and to the schemes of the American Sabbath Union. We bid the *Inquirer* Godspeed in its new departure, and trust that it will add greatly both to its popularity and to its influence. [73]
