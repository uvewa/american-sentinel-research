# Government and the Sermon on the Mount.

SOME weeks ago we printed a brief speech by the Bishop of Peterborough, England, in which the Bishop took the ground that civil government could not enforce the Sermon on the Mount. The speech was quite brief, but yet it was of sufficient length to stir up a “hornets’ nest,” and the Bishop was attacked on many sides. This brought the Bishop again to the front with a good lengthy discussion of the question. The article was printed in the *Fortnightly Review,* and we are glad that we can reproduce it for our readers. It will make about three installments for the SENTINEL columns, the first of which is printed herewith. The Bishop makes one slip, however, which will be noticed in its place. With this exception the argument is sound, and is excellently stated. The argument is of interest in this country, as well as in England, because of the persistent effort being made to secure legislation committed to the principles of Christianity. The Bishop says:—

“In the course of a discussion on Christian Socialism, at a Diocesan Conference, in commenting on a recent definition of it, as being ‘an attempt on the part of the State to compel all men to live according to the precepts of Christ,’ I ventured to make two assertions.

“1. That it is not possible for the State to carry out, in all its relations, literally, all the precepts of Christ, and that a State which attempted this could not exist for a week.

“2. That if it were possible to do this the result would be a perfectly intolerable tyranny.

“For saying this I have been assailed in language which proves nothing. Now I propose to discuss whether what I said is or is not true.

“Is it, then, possible for the State to carry out those precepts of his which inculcate non-resistance, inexhaustible forgiveness, and unlimited benevolence? Can the State, that is to say, disband its army, burn its ships of war, abolish its courts of justice, pull down its jails, dismiss its policemen, bestow its revenues upon all and sundry who ask for them, and yet still continue to exist as a State? If there really be any person who maintains this I cannot argue with him. His proper place is in a lunatic asylum.

“I am, however, taken to task by others of my critics on quite an opposite ground. Of course—these say—the State cannot literally obey all the precepts in the Sermon on the Mount; but neither can the individual. Those precepts can be obeyed by the individual in the spirit only, and not in the letter. Why may not the State do the same? I must confess to a firm belief that neither in the spirit nor in the letter can the entire of that sermon be carried out by the State, and that whenever it attempts to do this it is tending to its own destruction.

“What is a State? Speaking loosely this term is used as signifying the entire population of any country. The State, when we are speaking of its social or political obligations, can only mean that part of the nation which is empowered to speak and act on behalf of the rest. It is briefly, as it has been well defined to be, ‘the sovereign body having supreme power.’ The essential idea of a State always is that of sovereignty held on trust for the commonweal; and to this trust, for the sake of which it exists, it is morally bound to be faithful.

“It is clear, therefore, that a State, in order that it may be a faithful trustee, is bound—first, to preserve its own existence; and secondly, to resist, restrain, and even, if needs be, to destroy whatever and whomsoever assails its authority or attacks the interests committed to its charge. Selfpreservation, therefore, and the preservation of all that is intrusted to it, are the moral obligations of every State.

TWO IRRECONCILABLE IDEAS.

“Now, is this idea of protection of interests, of maintenance of rights, and of resistance to all assaults on these, the idea of the Sermon on the Mount? Distinctly it is not. The idea, the spirit, of that discourse is the diametrically opposite one of sacrifice of rights, surrender of interests, and non-resistance to assaults on these. It is, in a word, from beginning to end the idea of self-sacrifice as opposed to that of self-preservation. Is it not clear, therefore, that the State, if it is to be true to its own idea, if it is not to abdicate or betray [61] its trust, cannot carry out, in spirit even, the directly antagonistic idea of the Sermon on the Mount? Nay, is it not true that under analogous circumstances—namely, when acting as a trustee for the rights and interests of others—the precepts of the Sermon on the Mount do not apply and were not intended to apply to the private individual? Take the case of A. B., who is trustee or guardian for C. D. and E. F. Is he morally justified in giving away or in allowing any one to take away their possessions? Assuredly he is not. So long as he continues to be their trustee he is morally bound to maintain and defend these against all comers. He may allow the taking away of his own cloak and his own coat, but he has no right to allow the taking away of theirs. He may bestow all his own goods to feed the poor, but he has no right thus to bestow their goods, simply because they are theirs and not his. Quite apart, therefore, from the question, yet to be considered, as to how the individual is required by the Sermon on the Mount to deal with his own rights and possessions, it is clear that it gives him no directions as to how he is to deal with the rights and possessions of others.

“A State is something else and something more than a collection of individuals; and a Christian State, whatever that may mean (and that is a very large question), though bound by all those precepts of Christ which may be addressed to it as a State, is not therefore bound to obey all those which are addressed to its members in their several and diverse relations and capacities. A State is not morally justified in refusing to resist or prevent invasion—i*. e.,* to wage defensive war—because it would thereby be betraying to destruction the lives and properties of its subjects; it is not morally justified in expending all its revenues in pure benevolence, because it would thereby be applying those revenues to purposes for which they were not intrusted to it; it would not be morally justified in forgiving out of mere compassion all or any of its criminals, because it would thereby be weakening or even destroying those sanctions of order and of law which it is its duty to maintain and to enforce. In all these respects—and they might be largely multiplied—the State, if it were to act in the spirit of the Sermon on the Mount, would be failing to discharge functions which are given it, as we believe, of God himself, who, we Christians hold, has ‘ordained the powers that be,’ and so would be breaking a law which God assuredly has given it in the vain attempt at obeying laws which Christ has never given it. I venture, therefore, not only to repeat but to enlarge upon my first ‘odious’ and ‘immoral’ utterance, and to affirm not only that the State cannot but that it ought not to carry out in all its relations—either in the letter or in the spirit—all the precepts in the Sermon on the Mount, inasmuch as these were not all of them addressed to it by him who gave them.”
