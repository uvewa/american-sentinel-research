THE *Pearl of Days,* official organ of the American Sabbath Union, makes the following announcement in its issue of February 7, 1890:—

The Sunday Closing Association, of Chicago, acting upon the Roman military principle of "carrying the war into Africa," has prepared "a plan for the organization of the Sunday-rest people in each ward" into Sunday-rest leagues. The constitution thus defines the purposes and terms of membership:—

> ART. 2.—The object of this league shall be to cooperate with the Chicago Sunday Closing Association in securing, by all proper means, freedom from unnecessary Sunday labor, and especially the closing of factories, shops, stores, and saloons on Sunday.

> ART. 3.—This league shall be composed of representatives of the whole population of the—ward, independent of sectarian control or party dictation. Any citizen who is in favor of the object of this association and desires to aid in the furtherance of the same may become a member by signing this constitution.

Ward organizers will be appointed to carry out these provisions. Efforts will be made to secure the selection of aldermen at the coming city election who favor the closing of saloons on Sundays and the cessation of all unnecessary work on that day. No sect, faction, or special influence will control the ward leagues. The men who want to rest on Sunday will control the ward organizations, and they will have the opportunity of making their influence felt at the ballot-box, whether of independent candidates or for nominees of either political party who will favor Sunday rest. By this method of working the city, which is substantially after the long-established ways of the old political organizations, the Sunday Closing Association expects to develop, direct, and establish public opinion for practical advances upon the enemy's works. It is "bearding the lion in his den." The idea is novel, inspiring, and bold. Its results will be watched with interest, and the example, if even partially successful in the great city of the West, will be followed in more favorable localities. It means much more than mass meetings and strings of resolutions.
