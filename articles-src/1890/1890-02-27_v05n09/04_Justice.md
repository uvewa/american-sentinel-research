# Justice.

THIS was the subject of a lecture in the Jewish synagogue of Oakland, Sunday evening, January 12, by Justice Charles N. Fox, of the supreme court. The peculiarity of the appearance of this lecturer before a Jewish audience, with such a subject, is emphasized by the fact that the judge is an ardent Sunday-law advocate; and when that subject was a campaign issue before the people a few years ago, he was one of the prominent orators opposed to the repeal of the California Sunday Jaw.

The lecturer said, “The law of all civilized countries is but an elaboration of that given to the children of Israel, amid the thunders of Sinai,” and then he repeated the ten commandments. The hard part of it is, reverting to his perorations of seven years ago, to see how a Sunday law could be an elaboration of the ten commandments, which very plainly indicate that the first day of the week is one of secular labor.

Speaking of the injustice to which the Israelites have been subjected in various ages, the judge remarked that “even today in some countries they are feeling bitter injustice.” But he did not allude, as he might have done, to the injustice awaiting them in the United States when the Sunday law scheme, which he and his National Reform American Sabbath Union *confreres* are endeavoring to fasten upon the country, shall have been accomplished.

Again, the lecturer, “Possibly in the name of religion, alone, more injustice has been done than in any other name known among the children of men.” But he did not refer to the fact that the entailing of intolerant Sunday laws on the country is the opening wedge for a return to the injustice of the Dark Ages. Nor did he seem to realize the fact that when the gates to civil and religious liberty are closed in this great country whose boast is liberty of conscience, that would be the precursor of more intolerance in other countries, which have been impelled to a degree of liberality because of our asylum for their refugees from oppression.

Another sentiment which, coming from a Sunday-law enthusiast, may be considered as an admission, was this: “Nations at times are not moved by the final judgment of the aggregate of men; they are moved by emotion, and not awaiting the final judgment. Hence, injustice often occurs.” If the judge fully appreciated the truth he uttered in that expression, he would never again raise his voice in favor of a Sunday law. All religious legislation is the result of emotion, and it begets its kind with terrible rapidity and in excessive degree, rushing on to fanaticism, intolerance, persecution.

Said the lecturer: “Tolerance, however, is constantly growing, so that we may expect the adoption of the eleventh commandment, ‘Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so unto them.’ *Tolerance* has no legitimate place in the vocabulary of a free people. The person or principle that is merely *tolerated,* is always at the mercy of the power that tolerates. Equality of rights leaves tolerance in the background. Tolerance will never admit the principle of “Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so unto them.” If *tolerance* is growing, good-by to liberty of conscience.

On the theory that “we cannot hope to live to see pure, unadulturated justice administered by man, one toward another, or under men’s laws,” the lecturer indulged the hope that progress “may so develop the intellects of our children that they will attain nearer and nearer that justice that sits enthroned at the feet of God.” On the strength of this hope, the lecturer closed with the following picture:—

> When the church of the Christian and the synagogue of the Hebrew will be alike the place for the [60] worship of the one God, Father of men—then a man may enter either and make his devotions, knowing he is in a tabernacle of the one ever-living God. Then peace will wave her wand over the world.

Shall we suppose that he was contemplating the benign effects of a national Sunday law, or a National Reformed Constitution, when he portrayed that beautiful image of the unanimity of Hebrew and Christian worship under the progress of “men’s laws?” It used to be a settled theory on the Western plains that the rattlesnake and the prairie-dog dwelt harmoniously in the same burrow; but when the writer killed a rattler with a whole prairie dog inside of it, the cause of the harmony was explained. It was a clear case of coercion. Just so it will be when the Hebrew worship, as such, will so perfectly assimilate to the then “Christian” that there will be no perceptible difference.W. N. GLENN.
