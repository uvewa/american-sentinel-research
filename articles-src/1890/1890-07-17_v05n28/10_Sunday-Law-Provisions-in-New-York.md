SOME of the provisions in the Sunday laws of New York, are worthy of having emanated from the Sunday Union itself, instead of being, as they are, a survival of the blue-law code established by the Church and State union of Colonial days. The *Ellicottville* (N. Y.) *News,* makes this jocose suggestion: "Hunting on Sunday, subjects the offender to a fine of twenty- five dollars. One half of the fine goes to the prosecutor. Here is an opportunity for some one to make money without very much hard work." How long will it be before this will be adopted, together with the grab-bag and the church-lottery, as a legitimate means of assisting the church and Sunday-school treasuries?
