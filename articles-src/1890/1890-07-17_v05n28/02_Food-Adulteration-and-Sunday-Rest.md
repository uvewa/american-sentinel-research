ACCORDING to the report of a special agent of the Agricultural Department, fifteen per cent, of the food sold in the country is adulterated or misbranded, causing a total loss to the consumers of about $675,000,000 a year. This would be a large and perfectly legitimate field of operation for those philanthropists who are so profoundly concerned for the public health that they are fearful that people will not take sufficient rest. They should at least combine with their demand for "civil" rest on Sunday a demand for pure food. In that case their movement would certainly be partially civil; something which cannot be said of it now.
