THE Rhode Island Congregational Conference recently adopted resolutions denouncing the action of the School Board in discontinuing the reading of the Bible in the public schools of Providence. This action of the Conference is reviewed and criticised in the following excellent editorial from the Providence *Evening Bulletin*:—

The view of the matter taken by the Congregational Conference is, we think, wholly mistaken. It is based on a radical misunderstanding of the function and scope of the public schools; and we cannot believe that it is taken by the great majority of intelligent and fair-minded people, whatever their religious predilections. The idea lying behind these resolutions, as well as the thought running through all arguments for the retention of the Bible in the schools, seems to be that its removal is in some way a concession to the Catholics. As a matter of fact it is nothing of the sort. The reason that decided the discontinuance of Bible reading in the schools of Providence, the reason that has ruled in other similar cases, and the reason that must finally prevail everywhere, is that this change is necessary in order to make the public schools exactly what they are intended to be and nothing more.

In a land like ours where freedom of conscience and of worship is a fundamental guarantee, the only justifiable purpose of the public-school system must be to furnish a purely secular education under such circumstances and conditions as will make it available to all classes and sects in the community. The concession, then, would be in leaving the Bible in the schools. That would be a concession to the extreme, but it cannot be thought common Protestant contention that the public schools should be Protestant institutions as regards both control and instruction and, inevitably if not intentionally, as regards attendance.

For the Bible cannot be used in the schools, to be read without comment or explanation, without putting sectarianism into the system of public instruction. That the reading of the Bible in the schools is a sectarian act has been established by the recent court decision in Wisconsin, and it is obvious, indeed, from the most ordinary common sense view of the question. Any pupil of ordinary intelligence who listens to the reading of doctrinal portions of the Bible will be more or less instructed thereby in . . . doctrines about which there is sectarian difference of opinion.

Now, sectarian instruction must certainly comprehend the inculcation of religious doctrines upon which there is any difference of opinion. And as the Catholic Church declares that the version used in the schools is inaccurate and misleading on many points, as the Unitarian and Universalist Churches must hold that the reading of the Scriptures without comment or exposition is likely to lead to erroneous beliefs, as the Jews cannot consider the New Testament a sound body of doctrine, and as Agnostics would not have the Bible as a whole made a part of dogmatic instruction, it is clear that its reading is sectarian teaching. Consequently its reading has no proper place in schools that are meant to be non-sectarian. That is the first reason why it is excluded. Its retention makes the public educational system something other than "free" to all classes and sects. It makes them sectarian and leaves them available by only a portion of those who are compelled to pay taxes to support them.

But that is not the only reason for the discontinuance of a practice which, at the best, is perfunctory and of no practical advantage from any point of view. Perhaps the stronger reason is in the necessity of entirely separating religion and worship from public education if the functions of State and Church are to be kept wholly separate. As cannot be too often insisted the sole purpose of the public-school system is to provide a secular education, which is clearly within the province of the Government. It is not to give religious instruction or provide a place of worship, which is as clearly a private matter. But the reading of the Bible, so far as it amounts to anything at all, is religious instruction and the place where the Bible is read is, to that extent, as the Supreme Court of Wisconsin lately declared, a place of worship.

Even were it practicable, then, to provide an amended version of the Scriptures which should contain no doctrinal points, its reading would still be out of place in the public schools. There is no more reason for opening the sessions of the latter with devotional exercises than there would be in beginning the day's labor in stores and factories with similar ceremonies. The school is a place of work. It is a place where children are sent to get a secular education. The inculcation of religious doctrine and the cultivation of the feelings of worship are matters for the home and Church. They are matters with which the Government has no concern and which it cannot interfere in without uniting the functions of Church and State in a manner and to a degree wholly repugnant to the spirit of American institutions.

We, here in Providence, have taken that broad and sensible view of the question and by discontinuing the practice of opening the schools with Bible reading, have removed the last vestige of sectarianism from our school system. We have thus placed the system on a basis of equal opportunity for all, making it equally available, without violation of conscience, for Protestants or Catholics, Jews or Agnostics, though, of course, those who hold that religious training should be an integral part of education are not, and cannot be, satisfied with it. That much it was our plain duty to do as citizens of a State that intends to offer free education to all, and that is supposed, indeed, to compel the school attendance of all children of school age; and anything less than that would not have sufficed.

We have simply made the schools of this city what they are intended to be, on our theory of government, and nothing more. In deprecating that action, the Congregational Conference puts itself in a position which reflects little credit on its intelligence and liberality, and in which it cannot be believed it will be joined by the majority of American people, least of all by the people of Rhode Island, who from the first have so strenuously insisted on absolute freedom of conscience, and the entire separation of the affairs of the Church from the affairs of the State.
