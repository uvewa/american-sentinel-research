JUNE 17, the Sheriff of Rock County served a writ of *mandamus* on the School Board of the city of Edgerton, Wisconsin, commanding it to compel teachers not to read the Bible in the public schools. This is the district from which the famous Bible case came, which was decided by the Supreme Court against allowing the Bible in the public schools. Teachers have thus far ignored the decision.
