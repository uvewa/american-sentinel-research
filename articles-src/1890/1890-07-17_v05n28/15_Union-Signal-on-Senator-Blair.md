THE *Union Signal* has grown enthusiastic over Senator Blair, and finds vent in the following piece of sentimental sweetness:—

> Senator Blair is one of the wisest statesmen in Congress; the white-ribbon army, the home-folk, the wage-earners, the militant Christians, are proud of his leadership. Though a recreant Senate voted down his Educational Bill by six majority, his plan of national aid against illiteracy is sure to win. More than any other senator of this generation he represents the hopes of the classes that need a champion. He has dared to take up the gauntlet for them; dared to devote himself to their interests, and we humbly trust they may not only dare but have the power to do, that he may yet be President of the United States. Two pillars must be set up between which the processions of the future shall march into America's temple of prosperity and peace. They are National Education and National Prohibition. When put in place these pillars of our moral Hercules will bear the name of Henry W. Blair.

We know that the United States Senate is not composed of the highest model of statesmanship, but as for Senator Blair, we know that he is not a statesman at all, in any true sense of the word, where American principles are concerned. The legislation which he has originated, and the speeches which he has made in support of that legislation, show that he does not understand the first principles of the United States Government. It is true that he is the champion of the classes who need that kind of a champion, and it is true that to people who need that kind of a champion, he is the very kind of a champion that they would like; but there are two things about it that are too bad. First, it is too bad that there should be anybody to need such a champion. Secondly, even though there be such, it is too bad that they can find anybody in the United States to be their champion.
