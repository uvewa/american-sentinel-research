"I NOTICED a queer thing recently in Philadelphia," said a New York man the other day. "It was Sunday, and all the street cars ran as usual except that there were no bells on the horses. They told me that was the law there. They have to wear bells week-days, so that people will notice them coming and get out of the way, but Sundays, apparently, it doesn't make any difference whether folks are run over or not. The proprieties are observed you see, but business isn't interfered with."
