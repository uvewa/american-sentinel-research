THE *Catholic Review* remarks that "the theory that not a dollar should be spent by Government for the spread of religion is a very good theory, but it does not work, never did, and never will." It is not strange that Roman Catholics should take such a view of this matter, but it is surprising that so many Protestants should agree with them.
