# The Supreme Court and the Bible.

IN the *Northern Wisconsin News* of May 8, we find the report of a sermon delivered by Rev. T. DeWitt Peake, of the Methodist Episcopal Church, at Merrill, Wisconsin, Sunday evening, April 27. It sounds much more like genuine Methodist doctrine than does the report of the New York Methodist Episcopal Conferrence rebuking the action of the Wisconsin Supreme Court in the case referred to. We wish the men of Mr. Peake’s stamp were much more numerous, not only in the Methodist Church, but in all the other churches. We reprint the following extract from this sermon:—

It is known to all well-informed people in our State, that the Supreme Court of Wisconsin rendered a decision, March 18, which holds that the reading of the Bible in the public schools of the State is unconstitutional. The case was an unusual one, as well as a most important one. Doubtless, feeling the gravity of the situation, three of the Justices rendered separate opinions on different phases of the subject, the whole Court concurring in the decision on the main point at issue. The particular case at issue is known as the “Edgerton Bible Case,” it having been the habit of some teachers in the Edgerton schools to read the Bible at the opening of the morning session each day, using the King James version of the Bible. Some of the Catholic parents of the little city, whose children attended the public schools, protested against this exercise, and appealed to the Circuit Court for a writ of *mandamus,* compelling the School Board to have the practice stopped or show cause for not doing so. An alternative writ was granted, to which the School Board responded, and the relators demurred thereto. The demurrer was overruled, and on this, appeal was taken to the Supreme Court, which decided that the order of the Circuit Court overruling the demurrer of the relators must be reversed, and the cause remanded with directions to that Court to give judgment [204] for the relators on the demurrer, awarding a peremptory writ of *mandamus* as prayed for in the petition.

Since this decision was given, many adverse opinions have been issued from the pulpit and the press, showing that the ligaments which bind the State and Church together, in other countries, are not entirely severed in this country, in the minds of many good and loyal citizens. Indeed, many of my own brethren, in my own church, which is the most thoroughly American church in the world, have been foremost in denouncing the decision as antichristian and un-American. Now, as much as I dislike to do so, I must dissent from their opinion, and affirm that I can see nothing antichristian, nothing antiprotestant, nothing un-American in the decision of the Court. At first I thought there was; being influenced by garbled extracts from the opinion of the Court, and by the adverse criticism thereon by men in high places. But having secured the full text of the opinion and having studied it closely with the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights, I cannot see how the Court could have decided otherwise, and been American at all. And further, I think the decision will serve better the cause of truth and the Christian religion, as it is, than did it seek to re-knit the broken ligaments of Church and State, which it has taken centuries of bitter conflict and bloody struggle to sunder.

The American State, as I see it, is completely secular. It has no religion, as such, and is entirely indifferent to sects as such. Because this is the case, she gives each citizen religious liberty in the fullest sense, as a fundamental right. This means more than the toleration by law of differences of religious belief and of different modes of worship. The ideal American State is not to inquire into any man’s belief, as affecting his qualifications for office nor to concern itself either for the support or hindrance of any form of religion.

Toleration denotes neither the freedom of religion from the State control, nor the equality of all religions before the law. On the contrary, it implies either a preference by the State of some one form of faith or worship, though other forms are permitted; or the right of the State to regulate the administration of ecclesiastical affairs by the civil law. In the etymological sense, toleration is the permitting of that which is not fully approved. In the ecclesiastical sense, it means definitely, the allowance of religious opinions, and modes of worship, in a State when contrary to or different from those of the established church or belief. Toleration is a concession, in part, of that control over religion which the State assumes to exercise, but which it so far permits to fall into abeyance.

Now, you can see that this is not the condition of things in the ideal American State. The religious liberty, guaranteed by the ideal American State, is absolute freedom of religious opinion and worship, a vested right of conscience, not derived through any grant of the civil power. All that the ideal American State can do is to protect her citizens in the enjoyment of these vested rights. Liberty of opinion, liberty of worship, liberty in all matters pertaining to religion, is not a privilege created, or conceded, by the State, but is a right inherent in the personality of the individual conscience; and the ideal American State is pledged, not only, not to interfere with that right, but to protect it.

Now, the Supreme Court only protected the Catholic conscience, at Edgerton, and their liberty to worship according to its dictates. The Court, in my judgment, could not have done less than this. We may deplore the case, we may think the Catholic conscience is wrong, that it is miseducated and narrow, but the Court had nothing to do with anything but the facts, that the conscience is there, and that its rights are being trampled upon. The Court had no right to inquire into the fact whether the Catholic Church is friendly to the common-school system or not, for the question was whether the individual conscience of the people of Edgerton, was abused by the religious exercises, held each morning in the public schools of the city? The Court had no business to ask whether it was a Catholic, or a Methodist, or a Baptist conscience, that had been or was being abused.

I think the attempt of any body of Christians to introduce their discriminating doctrines and practices into schools that are the common property of all citizens, should be set aside as a monstrous usurpation. Only by doing this can we have any harmony in the schools of the State at all, and without harmony but little good can be accomplished by them.
