# National Religious Liberty Association.

## Declaration Of Principles.

> We believe in the religion taught by Jesus Christ.

> We believe in temperance, and regard the liquor traffic as a curse to society.
> We believe in supporting the civil government, and submitting to its authority.
> We deny the right of any civil government to legislate on religious questions.
> We believe it is the right, and should be the privilege, of every man to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience.
> We also believe it to be our duty to use every lawful and honorable means to prevent religious legislation by the civil government; that we and our fellow-citizens may enjoy the in estimable blessings of both religious and civil liberty.

J. O. CORLISS, Field Secretary of the National Religious Liberty Association, is speaking in New Hampshire, in defense of the principles of religious liberty as expressed in the First Amendment to the Constitution, and advocated by the Association. The Concord *Evening Monitor, *of June 2, publishes an excellent report of an address, by Mr. Corliss, which appeals in forcible and unmistakable terms to every citizen and every legislator. The discourse was an able arraignment of the two measures,—the joint resolution providing for an amendment to the Constitution, requiring the teaching of the principles of religion in the public schools; and the bill for a national Sunday law.

The closing comment is worthy the attention of every American citizen: “The people should look into this matter and say to those who are sent to Congress, ‘Don’t put your hand upon our religious liberties.’”
