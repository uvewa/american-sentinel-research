THE Washington Baseball Club has been prevented from filling an engagement for a Sunday game at Atlantic Park, Washington, by the Commissioners of the District of Columbia.

District Commissioner Douglass thus states the law and the gospel of the case, as reported in the Washington *Evening Star:—*

"Commissioner Douglass in an interview with a *Star* reporter upon the subject said: 'I thought it would shock the country to learn that such a thing as Sunday baseball was permitted at the national capital. If we had been unsuccessful in finding a law I should have done my utmost to manufacture one.'"

"You found a law then?" queried the *Star* man. "Yes, we did, the old common law of England held that the Christian religion was part of the common law, and when the first settlers came to this country they brought the common law with them. You know that it's against the Christian religion to play ball on Sunday, for on the face of it, it's a violation of the fourth commandment. That is the law we operated upon in this case."

So the time has already come when the Commissioners, having in charge the administration of the local government of the national capital, search the statute books for an authority, however obscure, to uphold them in enforcing a religious requirement; and openly assert their readiness to manufacture a law to suit if none shall be found.

So far as its applicability is concerned, that is just what they have done,—manufactured a law. Blackstone says, in Book IV, page 58 (Cooley's Blackstone): "These are offenses punishable at common law by fine and imprisonment, or other infamous corporal punishment; *for Christianity is part of the laws of England."* Commissioner Douglass is no more endowed with authority to decide what is a "violation of the fourth commandment," or with power to enforce such a decision, than is the chief executive of this Nation endowed with political perfection, because Blackstone says, in Book I. page 245 (Cooley's Blackstone), "The law also ascribes to the king, in his political capacity, absolute *perfection.* The king can do no wrong. . . The king, moreover, is not only incapable of *doing* wrong, but even of *thinking* wrong; he can never mean to do an improper thing: in him is no folly or weakness." One of these political dogmas is just as sound as the other, and if one may be applied as binding now and here, the other may be also, for the same reason.

The Christian religion is a part of the law of the land; the President (and Commissioner Douglass) "can do no wrong, neither think any wrong, in him is no folly or weakness." This is the perfection which the Commissioner has arrogated to himself in assuming to decide that to play ball on Sunday is a violation of the fourth commandment, and then, as he says, "to operate upon that law."

The Commissioner decides that when Jehovah wrote, on Sinai, "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, in it thou shalt not do any work," etc., he intended to have written, "the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, is the rest day of a Christian nation, in it thou shalt not play baseball," etc.; and having so determined, the Commissioner by virtue of divine right of authority as the representative of the chief executive, who can do no wrong, constitutes himself the vicegerent of God to enforce his law. This is the common law precedent upon which the Commissioner has seen fit to take summary action as a public official of the capital city of the United States.

It is well to look through that chapter of Blackstone on "Offenses against God and Religion," from which the Commissioner obtains his "law," that we may know what to expect in the future. (See Cooley's Blackstone, Book IV, pp. 41-64.) In this chapter Blackstone enters into the consideration of those offenses "which are more immediately injurious to God and his holy religion."

> I. Of this species (of offenses) the first is that of *apostasy, *or a total renunciation of Christianity, by embracing either a false religion, or no religion at all. This offense can only take place in such as have once professed the true religion. . . .

> II. A second offense is that of *heresy,* which consists, not in a total denial of Christianity, but of some of its essential doctrines, publicly and obstinately avowed.
> III. Another species of offenses against religion are those which affect the *established church.* And these are either positive or negative: positive, by reviling its ordinances; or negative, by non-conformity to its worship.
> IV. The fourth species of offenses, therefore, more immediately against God and religion, is that of *blasphemy* against the Almighty, by denying his being or providence; or by contumelious reproaches of our Saviour Christ. Whither also may be referred all profane scoffing at the holy Scriptures, or exposing it to contempt and ridicule. These are offenses punishable at common law by fine and imprisonment, or other infamous corporal punishment; for Christianity is part of the laws of England. . . .
> VI. A sixth species of offense against God and religion of which our ancient books are full, is a crime of which one knows not well what account to give. I mean the offense of *witchcraft, conjuration, enchantment, or sorcery. . . .*
> VII. A seventh species of offenders in this class are all *religious impostors;* such as falsely pretend an extraordinary commission from heaven; or terrify and abuse the people with false denunciations of judgments. These, as tending to subvert all religion, by bringing it into ridicule and contempt, are punishable by the temporal courts with fine, imprisonment, and infamous corporal punishment. . . .
> IX. Profanation of the Lord's day, vulgarly (but improperly) called *Sabbath-breaking,* is a ninth offense against God and religion, punished by the municipal law of England. . . . And therefore the laws of King Athelstan forbade all merchandizing on the Lord's day, under very severe penalties. And by the statute 27 Henry VI., chap. 5, no fair or market shall be held on the principal festivals, Good Friday, or any Sunday (except the four Sundays in harvest), on pain of forfeiting the goods exposed to sale. And since, by the statute 1 Car. I„ chap 1, no person shall assemble out of their own parishes for any sport whatsoever upon this day; nor in their parishes, shall use any bull or bear-bating, interludes, plays, or other *unlawful* exercise, or pastimes; on pain that every offender shall pay 3s. 4d. to the poor.
These are some of the provisions of Chapter IV. Book IV., Blackstone's Commentaries, from which the Commissioners of the District of Columbia obtain their law for the ordering of the civil affairs of the capital of this free and enlightened country, just entering upon the last decade of the nineteenth century, and after more than a hundred years of supposed separation of Church and State.
