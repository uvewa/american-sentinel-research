MEN do not form civil societies for the maintenance of any form of religious opinions, but for purposes common to all and antecedent to all; consequently all attempts to found any civil superiority upon religious belief, are simply attempts at fraud and robbery; and are to be resisted, like other attempts at fraud and robbery.—*Westminster Review*.
