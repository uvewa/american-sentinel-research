# Religious Liberty Involved.

A DISPATCH from Nashville, Tennessee, to the *Sun,* June 15, says:—

The Supreme Court of Tennessee has just rendered a decision affirming the action of the lower court in the case of the State *vs.* R. M. King. This case was appealed from the Circuit Court held in Troy, Obion County, last March, and has attracted much attention on account of the religious question involved in it. Mr. King is a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, a sect which observes the seventh day (Saturday) as the Sabbath, instead of Sunday, the first day of the week. The defense has been made by the National Religious Liberty Association, an organization of recent origin, which admits no one into its membership who does not believe in the Christian religion, but holds that the functions of religion and the State are entirely distinct, and, for the interests of both, should be kept separate. Mr. King is a farmer, and was indicted for quietly working on his own premises, not in sight of any place of public worship. None of the witnesses for the State testified to having been disturbed in any way or to having a knowledge that any one else had been disturbed, except that their moral sense had been shocked by seeing work done on Sunday.

The defendant was first arraigned before a Justice of the Peace, and fined three dollars and costs, amounting in all to about twelve dollars, which he paid. He was afterward indicted for the same offense by the Grand Jury of Obion County, and was fined seventy-five dollars. An appeal was taken to the Supreme Court on the plea (1) that the acts complained of and proven did not constitute a nuisance, as charged in the indictment; (2) that the Court erred in not permitting the defendant to prove that he had been once arrested, tried, convicted, and fined for the same offense, and that he had paid the fine and costs; (3) on the ground of the appeal of the Attorney-General to the the religious prejudices of the jury, by his bitter denunciations of the religious views of the defendant, and confounding the sect with which he is connected with the Mormons.

The case will be taken to the Supreme Court of the United States. This will be the first case involving the constitutionality of Sunday laws that has been brought before the United States Supreme Court.

An association has been organized in Tennessee, the members of which pledge themselves to prosecute every violation of the Sunday laws. A number of persons who observe the seventh day as the Sabbath are now under indictment for working on Sunday. They are tenacious of their faith, and claim the right, under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and the Bill of Rights of the State of Tennessee, to work on Sunday. In view of recent movements in favor of a national Sunday law, and the opposition to this and all other religious legislation by the National Religious Liberty Association, the progress of this case through the Court will be watched with deep interest by many.

AN Iowa paper, of June 14, says:—

> The German Lutheran Synod, in session at Dubuque this week, has 300 ministers, 450 congregations, and 50,000 communicants, and is spread over fourteen States. Delegates were present from Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Ohio, Missouri, Michigan, and Washington. The Convention was opened by the President, the Rev. Prof. G. Grosswell, D. D., of Waverly, Iowa. Reports were read denouncing the Bennett Law. The Synod resolved to introduce Barnes’ school text-books of the American Book Company in the parochial schools.

And this is the people who, we are told, have to be forced by law to educate their children in English. [207-208]

THE president of the Young Men’s Christian Association of Indianapolis, has been asked to resign because as president of a street railway company he ran extra cars on Sunday to a suburban resort of doubtful character. The demand for his resignation comes from the Presbyterian ministers of that city.

DURANGO, Colorado, has a Sunday law entitled, “An Ordinance Requiring the Observance of the Sabbath.” But of course it is a mere “police regulation,” a “sanitary measure,” to secure to the “tired son of toil a day of rest.” It must be so for with the exception of the title it is almost identical with numerous State and municipal acts which we are assured are purely civil.

THE *Western Herald* published at Burlington, Iowa, comes to us filled with hard arguments against Sunday laws and kindred religious legislation. Referring to the efforts of the Sunday-law advocates the *Herald* says: “It has taken centuries to evolve separation of Church and State, and now we are asked to surrender our vantage ground, and relapse once more into the darkness of the medieval ages.”

JUNE 11 and 12, there was held in this city a Temperance Congress representing every shade of temperance sentiment in the country, the only condition required of delegates, being opposition to the saloon. The Congress was large and enthusiastic, and while it adopted no platform and passed no resolutions, there was no room to doubt that an overwhelming majority present were third party Prohibitionists. The readers of THE SENTINEL need not be told that it is opposed to the liquor traffic, yet we could not help feeling that there was a spirit manifested in the Congress which bodes no good to the country; it was the spirit of intolerance, and of government by clamor. Speaking of the Supreme Court decision in the original package cases, one speaker said that if the Constitution upheld the liquor traffic, he was in favor of spitting on the Constitution and stepping on it. If the Constitution as it is upholds the liquor traffic, we say let us respect it and abide by it until such time as public sentiment shall be educated up to the point of amending the Constitution. The country can get along very well without the patriotism that proposes to spit on the Constitution.

WHEN Mr. Crafts started west across the Continent on his Sunday-law tour, we announced his appointments, which, it will be remembered, were invariably at one of two or three places each particular date. As he returns, he finds it necessary to make his appointment each date to be at any one of a series of from one to seven different places. They are as follows:—

> June 27, Watertown, South Dakota, or St. Peter, Minnesota, or Mankato or Fergus Falls; June 29, Minneapolis; June 30, Winona or Faribault or Northfield or Owatonna or Hastings or Red Wing; July 1, Madison, Wisconsin, or La Crosse or Green Bay; July 2, Madison or Prairie du Chien or Freeport or Galesburg or Dubuque or Davenport or Burlington; July 3, Des Moines or Cedar Rapids or Iowa City or Indianola or Keokuk.

This form of appointment, says Secretary Gault, is “in order that the organizers of the opposition may not get on his track.” It is well for the American Sabbath Union thus to advertise his fear of the opposition. Why doesn’t he rally his seven million two hundred thousand Roman Catholic petitioners for a national Sunday law, and at one stroke overwhelm the opposition?

A READER has sent us a report of the Gloucester County (N. J.) Temperance Alliance clipped from the *Gloucester Constitution,* which is of interest because of one bit of information which it contains. Referring to an effort which had been made in the name of the Alliance to prevent the issuance of a liquor license to Lincoln Park Company, the chairman of the committee having the matter in charge said:—

> In conversation with the judges your chairman told them *our principal objection to Lincoln Park was the fear of Sunday selling and the consequent disgrace to our county*.

Some further history of the case then follows, and the report concludes thus:—

> Our attorney stated plainly our objections. Then Mr. Mc Gowen, the President [of the Park company] and Mr. Patterson, the applicant, personally stated that no liquor would be sold on Sunday; that all the laws would be obeyed. . . . Upon receiving these assurances, on the advice of counsel, your chairman consented to withdraw the remonstrance. Our counsel made the announcement to the court, the judges nodded their approval, and in a few minutes publicly announced that the license to keep an inn and tavern at Lincoln Park was granted.

This shows the drift of much of the so-called temperance sentiment, and is right in line with something which appeared some months since in the *California Prohibitionist:* a correspondent of that paper remarked that if the saloons would only close on Sunday, he thought it was about all that could be reasonably asked of them.

“MORAL forces,” said Mrs. Mary T. Lathrap at the recent Temperance Congress in this city, “are the imperial forces, and the nation is safe only when its moral forces are on the throne. I believe that in some of our great cities, and in some eastern commonwealths, we are reaching a moral deadlock, when the moral forces are beaten down, and beaten back by the forces of evil around them. Now I believe that the Church is the party, and ought to be the organized expression of moral forces in government just as I believe that the saloon is the organized form of the devil’s kingdom on earth.”

Let us examine this a little. “The moral forces are the imperial forces.”

“The nation is safe only when its moral forces are on the throne.”

“The Church is the organized expression of moral forces in government.”

The inevitable conclusion is that the Church should be upon the throne. And yet, in common with other National Reformers, Mrs. Lathrap would no doubt indignantly deny any desire to unite Church and State in this country or to subject the State to the Church.

A JUDGE in Pennsylvania, lately rendered a decision on “works of necessity and mercy” on Sunday, in which he declared that Sunday could not be surrendered to the fierce rivalry to get gain, and that “it has come down to us with the most solemn sanctions, both of God and man, and if we do not appreciate it as we ought, we are, at least, bound to preserve it.”

Upon which, the *Pearl of Days* remarks:—

> Above all else, the supreme will of God as to what the Sabbath day was given to man for should enable us to decide questions of supposed necessity.

Exactly! That is the real reason in all the arguments for Sunday laws that are made, and it shows the hollow pretenses to virtue in the arguments of those who plead for the “civil” Sunday. [209]
