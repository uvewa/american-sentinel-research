IN the article on the Bennett Law in THE SENTINEL of June 5, we said:—

> The Lutherans maintain the perfect right of the public school to exist, and willingly pay their proportion of the public-school taxes.

We have received letters from Nebraska and Wisconsin, stating that this is not true in the localities from which these letters come. One of the letters coming from the County Judge of Jefferson County, Nebraska, says that to his knowledge the Lutherans pay the public school taxes unwillingly and only because they must do so. Another comes from a trustworthy citizen of Liberty Bluffs, Wisconsin, in which he says the same thing and gives the following facts:—

> When I settled in this part of Wisconsin, the German Lutherans were not in the majority, and we had eight or nine months school in the year, and fairly good teachers; but just as soon as they got a majority of votes in our district, the time was cut down to five months in the year, all in the winter, no summer term; and teachers wages cut down as low as thirteen dollars to sixteen dollars per month. They voted down all propositions to repair school house, purchase maps, dictionary, etc. Finally when this did not break up the school altogether, they voted to have no school at all, and actually *had no school for over a year;* and if the State Superintendent had not interfered, this state of things might have continued. Many other districts that I know of have this same difficulty, more or less where the German Lutheran element predominates, especially in rural districts.

We made our statements upon the authority of the statements of the synods of the West. The official statements of the Lutheran body must be taken as the principles of the body; and although these facts no doubt exist in the localities named, it is clearly in violation of the principles announced by the body as such in the United States. We are glad to know these facts. We do not indorse the action in the slightest degree, yet from the official statements of the Lutheran body, in our position we cannot hold that body responsible for the action of the Lutherans in these localities. These facts only show that the Lutherans in those localities have gone contrary to their principles; and whether in that place or any other, such action has ever been taken, we earnestly hope that they may reform, and conform to the principles set forth as the principles of the Lutheran body.

We have no sympathy with any antagonism to the public-school system. But, the practice of the Lutherans in the localities named, even though it were more general, will not justify, to the least extent, the State in invading private rights, and taking charge of the private school, and putting itself in the place of the parent, as the Bennett Law does. Clearly the Lutherans named by these correspondents were, and are, in the wrong; and the State of Wisconsin, in the Bennett Law, is also clearly in the wrong; and the wrong course of the Lutherans does not make right the wrong course of the State.
