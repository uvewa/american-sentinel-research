# An Outrage.

THE Santa Rosa, California, *Republican* has the following editorial notice of the fining of R. M. King, a Seventh-day Adventist, in Tennessee, for working on Sunday:—

> And this occurred in one of the United States of America, in the latter part of the nineteenth century! Let us hear no more about Blue Laws and witch burning.

> The Seventh-day Adventists are a deeply religious people. Most faithfully do they observe the day which they believe is ordained of God for rest. On that day they do no work—transact no business. Often the day is kept at great inconvenience. But it is set apart by most members of the church and devoted to public and private worship.
> Then, too, the Seventh-day Adventists are generally conscientious and honest people. They are reliable, and can be depended upon. Their code of morals is founded on their construction of Bible declarations. As a class they are true to their convictions of right, and equity, and justice. With them all these things are not a matter of custom, but of profound conviction as to the desire and purpose of the Almighty.
> And in this country there are States having laws under which these people, who have religiously observed the day of the week which they believe was divinely set apart for that purpose, are fined for working on another day! It is an outrage to so interfere with the enjoyment of religious liberty.
The *Republican* ought to know whereof it affirms concerning Seventh-day Adventists, for the “Year Book of the California Conference” shows that Santa Rosa has a church of that denomination numbering sixty members. In this Tennessee case the victim of the bigotry of his neighbors, and of an unwise and wicked law, was clearly a man of excellent character; but that has nothing to do with the principle involved; the law would be just as bad if all who suffer under it were blacklegs. A law which makes possible persecution for conscience’ sake, ought not to exist in any State for a day. The law has, however, been sustained by the Supreme Court of Tennessee, as appears from a notice in another column of this paper. This does not prove that the law is right; it only shows that the people of that State need to be educated in the correct principles of civil and religious liberty.
