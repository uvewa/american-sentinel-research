REFERRING to the King case, the details of which are familiar to our readers, the Denison, Texas, *Gazette* says:—

> The case has been taken to the Supreme Court of the United States by the National Religious Liberty Association, a society that admits no person to membership who does not believe in Christianity, but holds that the functions of Church and State are entirely distinct. If the United States Supreme Court does not teach the Tennessee witch-burners a lesson, a majority of the American people will be disappointed. We have had entirely too much of the Sabbath invasion of other men's homes. It feeds prejudice, embitters enmity, fractures friendship, wrongs individuals, and does no manner of good whatever.

It is certain that this case is bound to attract a great deal of attention. It is being very extensively noticed by the press of the country.
