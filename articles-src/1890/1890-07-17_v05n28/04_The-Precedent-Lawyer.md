# The Precedent Lawyer.

IN his address before the National Reform Convention in Washington, last April, Judge Hagans, of Cincinnati, said:—

> Very early the *dies dominicus* was set apart and the people were not to be employed in secular business on that day. Legislation in England began in the reign of Henry VI., but a little more than a hundred years ago. During the reign of Charles II., a statute was passed, which is the origin or foundation of the various and somewhat dissimilar acts of the legislatures of the several States of the United States on this subject. . . . In every State in this Union, Sunday laws have been passed by our various legislatures containing provisions of more or less stringency, and construed and enforced by the highest courts, until a Sabbath of cessation from secular pursuits is firmly intrenched in American law, there to abide forever.... This legislation has come to stay in this land.

Here speaks the precedent lawyer. Because the legislatures and the courts have mistakenly perpetuated a Church and State Statute of Charles II., therefore, the error is “firmly intrenched in American law,” and “there to abide forever,” although in conflict with the spirit of American institutions and the letter of the injunction which the general Government lays upon itself in the First Amendment to the Constitution.
