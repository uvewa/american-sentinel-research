THE *Loyal American* plaintively asks: "Shall we permit priests to deprive native born Americans of a birthright, the right to know the language of their native land?" Certainly not; neither shall we suffer them to be deprived of the privilege of learning the language of their fathers if they wish to learn it. The fact is, however, that no priests wish to deprive "native born Americans," or anybody else, of learning the language of their native land; indeed they are anxious for them to learn it, and to learn every thing else that will enable them to become legislators, etc., and so rule the country. The *Loyal American* need not fear that any considerable number of "native born Americans" will grow up in ignorance of the language and customs of the country.
