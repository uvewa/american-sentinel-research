# Sunday Laws and the Working People.

ONE argument much used in favor of Sunday laws is that such legislation is necessary to give the laboring classes a day of rest. Indeed this is a standard argument and it is urged in favor of both State and national laws for Sunday observance. Senator Blair, the father of the well-known Sunday-rest Bill now on the calendar of the Senate, has himself stated the case thus:—

> The mass of the working people would never get Sunday rest if there had not been a law of the land that gave it to us. There is that practical fact, and we are fighting for the tired, hungry man, woman, and child all over the country who want a chance to lie down and rest for twenty-four hours out of the whole seven days.

The Senator probably believes this to be true; but he is certainly mistaken if he does, for the mass of the people now have, without effective Sunday laws, all the rest that they have a mind to take on Sunday. California has, for about eight years, been without any Sunday law whatever, yet it is the testimony of even the friends of Sunday legislation, that the day is as well observed there as in States having such laws. A residence of six years in one of the largest cities of that State, as well as observation in the largest city in the State, warrants the writer in saying that California has fully as good and as general Sunday observance as States having Sunday laws; very much better than this city. Secular work and business are very generally suspended upon that day, and the great mass of laborers have opportunity to spend the day as they see fit. Of course a few are compelled to choose between losing their positions and working on Sunday, but that is no more true there than it is in States having Sunday laws.

It is a very general custom to give those who work on Sunday some other day off, and there are few indeed, if we except housewives and servant girls, who work seven days in the week. The legislation proposed by the Senator would not do that which he assumes that it would do. Sunday laws would, however, if they were framed as many demand that they shall be, virtually compel thousands to literally “lie down and rest” upon Sunday for it would make it impossible for them to do anything else. Only those who live in large cities can appreciate the privilege of an occasional outing in the country or in some park; but these Sunday-law people [203] would place all this beyond the reach of the poor by making it impossible for them to reach such places upon the only day that they can spend time to go to them; namely, upon Sunday. The rich can keep carriages and can on Sunday drive to these places or reach them upon other days either by private or public conveyances, but the poor cannot take the necessary time except on Sunday; and then if the hopes of the Sunday-law advocates should be realized, no public conveyances would be permitted on Sunday, and the rich would enjoy a monopoly of the parks and various resorts which now make life tolerable for the toiling masses in our great cities.

Of course Sunday holidayism is not desirable; no more is very much of other holidayism. People are likely on all such occasions to run to excess; but hosts of these people will not go to church and what are they to do? A leading paper in this city says:—

> Almost anything is better, for people who are confined by work during the week, than to remain in the heated, noisy, and ill-smelling city on a hot Sunday. Sensible and sophisticated folk start early in the day and thus avoid the rush. They seek an unfrequented rather than a popular resort. They prefer the beach, the woods, the fields, to the best-dressed crowd that ever assembled. And when they find the right spot, they rest in the way which does them most good, whether it be a new and agreeable form of activity or sheer “lazing.” It is a great thing to know how to rest and to cultivate a genius for repose.

But this sort of resting is just what the Sunday-law people are determined the people shall not do; they propose to make it impossible for poor people to get into such places on Sunday. This city has, in Central Park, two magnificent museums, one of art, another of natural history, but they are both closed on Sunday in deference to the demands of those who reverence the day. Referring to the last session of the Legislature of this State, the *Mail and Express* says:—

> It is important to note that the Legislature did not altogether ignore, as some may be led to suppose, every measure having a moral bearing. It refused, for instance, to pass the bill providing for the opening on Sunday afternoons of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Museum of Natural History, in this city, and for this, every true believer in the sanctity of the Sabbath ought to be grateful. A large and powerful influence was brought to bear upon the Legislature in favor of this measure, and it is greatly to its credit that it did not pass.

It will be observed that the only reason urged here for not opening these museums on Sunday is the religious character of the day. A large number of people have a religious regard for Sunday, and for this reason those who do not so regard it, or who so regarding it do not think it wrong to look at paintings and other beautiful and interesting things upon that day, must be deprived of the privilege because of the feelings of those who think it wicked to spend any portion of Sunday in such a way. These people well know that there are thousands who cannot visit the museums upon other days, but they care not for this; they keep Sunday and so everybody else must keep it too; they take snuff and if others don’t take snuff also, they must at least sneeze. What they propose is to so hedge them about with law that they will be compelled to choose between staying at home and going to church. It is the duty of the State, they argue, to look after the morals of the people; the people cannot be truly moral without going to church and being religious; so it is the duty of the State to so arrange matters that they will go to church and be religious; and the easiest way to secure this end is by Sunday laws.

There can be no doubt that Sunday laws are essentially religious. The *Christian Statesman* if less wise is more candid than some of its co-workers in the Sunday-law cause, and unhesitatingly declares that the only basis for such legislation is found in the fourth commandment. In support of this proposition the *Statesman* says:—

> Judge Flandrau, of the Supreme Court of Minnesota, declared that the Sabbath law of that State “can have no other object than the enforcement of the fourth of God’s commandments, which are a recognized and excellent standard of both public and private morals” (Brimhall *vs.* Van Campen, 8 Minnesota Reports, 13). Judge Caldwell, of the Supreme Court of Texas, held that “the object of the Legislature was to forbid all secular employments on the Sabbath, not excepted in the act. The disregard of the Sabbath, the refusal to recognize it as a day sanctified to holy purposes, constitutes the offense” (Elsner *vs.* the State, 30 Texas Reports, 524). The Supreme Court of Alabama said: “We do not think the design of the Legislature in the passage of the act can be doubted. It was evidently to promote morality and advance the interests of religion, by prohibiting all persons from engaging in their common and ordinary vocations” (O’Donnel *vs. *Sweeney, 5 Alabama Reports, 467. See also Wright *vs.* Geer, 1 Root, 474; Fox *vs.* Able, 2 Connecticut Reports, 548; George *vs.* George, 47 New Hampshire Reports, 27).

Of course the fourth commandment says nothing about Sunday, but, inasmuch as it is popularly supposed that it now enjoins the observance of that day, and inasmuch as the design of those demanding Sunday laws is to honor that day for religious reasons, Sunday laws have of necessity a distinctively religious character. They are religious legislation and utterly at variance with the spirit of our free institutions.C. P. B.
