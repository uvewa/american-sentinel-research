THE AMERICAN SENTINEL is as much opposed to lotteries as any one can be, and holds that the State should suppress them; but we cannot approve the sentiment expressed recently by Mr. Foster, the leader of the anti-lottery fight in the Louisiana Senate. He declared that the side which he represented could fight $1,000 bills with twenty-five dollar shot guns. This was simply a declaration that they would meet fraud by force. The lottery which they are fighting is bad, but, bad as it is, it is not as utterly demoralizing as is the use of the shot-gun argument in politics. Those who espouse great moral ideas should themselves be moral, and should confine themselves to methods that at least are not opposed to good morals. The use of the shot gun in politics, should be left for the other side in this lottery fight.
