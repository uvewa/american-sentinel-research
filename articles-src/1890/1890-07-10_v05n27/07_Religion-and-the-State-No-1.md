# Religion and the State.—No. 1.

THE present tendency, in various countries, is to form a closer relation between civil government and religion. The principal reason assigned for this by those who favor the movement is that the constant increase of crime demands a moral remedy to be administered by the civil laws- of the commonwealth. This movement generally manifests itself in two ways, namely, in the demand for stricter Sunday laws, and the reading of the Bible in the public schools.

In seeking to enact strict Sunday laws, the promoters of the movement deny any wish to change in the least the present relation of the Church to the State. Indeed, they unanimously assert that, while it is within the province of the State to guard public morals and promote the interests of the Church, the two departments should forever be kept separate. But, to justify the State in enacting Sunday laws, they declare that to maintain a Sunday rest, is only to insure order and peace in the community, for which it is the duty of every commonweath to provide. Thus, Sunday laws are made to appear as civil or police regulations, and as though they were in no way calculated to interfere with a man’s personal relation of faith and obedience to God, and as in no sense religious enactments.

The same theory maintains that the Bible in the schools is necessary in order that children, who are prospective citizens of the commonwealth and therefore the wards of the State, may be educated in morals, without which they cannot properly discharge the responsibilities of citizenship soon to be laid upon them. This point is emphasized by the fact that many children have no moral training at home, and, not being required to attend church, they are, therefore, abandoned to the liability of developing into criminals unless the State steps in to counteract this tendency, through the public schools.

It certainly is to be regretted, that some children are not trained in virtue and morality, either at home or in the church. Could all have the benefit of a proper religious training from infancy, it would undoubtedly be a safeguard against crime, as well as a stimulus to high attainments in citizenship. But, does it follow that because the Church and the home are unfaithful in the discharge of religious duties, the State should assume their prerogatives, and, in addition to its civil duties, attempt the teaching of religious doctrines?

Doubtless some are ready to answer this question at once in the affirmative. But there are some principles underlying this whole matter, which it is well to consider, before drawing a final conclusion. Every man has certain natural rights which must necessarily accompany his existence. If man were the creature of a civil government, the same power by which that government could create its subjects, would enable it to create the rights of its subjects. But man, being God’s creature, existed long before any civil government, and, of course, his rights also antedate all such governments. On the other hand, civil government is the creature of man, and was created by him, for a single purpose, that of protecting his previously existing rights, given him by his Creator. Civil government, therefore, having no power to bestow these rights, can properly have no authority to infringe them. The only province of civil government, is to protect rights already possessed, and no matter how infinitesimal a man’s rights may be, it is the duty of civil government to protect those rights against any encroachment. For any government to go beyond this, and assume to override or restrict man’s God-given rights, is to usurp an authority which belongs only to the Creator of man and his rights.J. O. CORLISS.

WE do not vouch for the statement, but it is said that “a saloon man has been found in Washington who closes his place with prayer. His application for renewal of license having been rejected on the ground that his place bore a bad name, he appeared before the commissioner in his own behalf. In reply to the question, ‘Do you shut up promptly at midnight?’ he answered: ‘When ten minutes to twelve comes, I kneel down, say my prayers, and shut up.’” Prayer under such conditions would be just about as much of a farce as is the labeling of governments and corporations, Christian, when everybody knows that they are nothing of the kind, and when in the very nature of the case they cannot be Christian.
