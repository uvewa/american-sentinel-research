# Is Protestantism Powerless?

AN old saw says, “You cannot eat your cake and keep it, too.” In like manner it may be said you cannot keep the public schools intact and devote them to the furtherance of religious instruction. Why? —For several reasons. In the first place, there can be no religious instruction without giving that which by some religionists will be considered sectarian. For example, when it is insisted that the Bible should be read in the public schools, what is meant is that a specific translation and none other must be used. That translation is the King James version. It is objected to by Roman Catholics that it is a distinctively Protestant version; that certain renderings are wrongly made; and it is objected that the Bible should be explained by competent teachers, for which work the public school teacher is not qualified. Therefore, say the Roman Catholics, such instruction is sectarian. Is it, or is it not? Suppose the circumstances were reversed, and the Catholics forming the majority were to insist on reading the Douay version in the schools with “do penance” translated for “repent”—would not Protestants object, and with good reason?

But if it be insisted that this King James version shall be read and taught as “an educative force,” is it not clear the way is opened up to the Roman Catholics [196] not only to withdraw from the public schools, but to insist that a share of the school tax shall be allotted to their parish schools? A version of the Bible held to by certain sects and repudiated by other sects is to that extent sectarian. How is it possible, then, to keep the schools free from sectarianism, and yet introduce a sectarian version of the Bible in the schools?

Furthermore, is Protestantism so weak that it must depend upon five or ten minutes of Bible instruction, by teachers of the public schools, many of whom are unqualified for the work of instruction, in order to religiously educate their children? Are the home, the Church with its prayermeetings, its Sunday-school and other agencies wholly inadequate to the work of religiously educating the youth, so that if the King James version of the Old Testament is not read the omission would be “deplorable and suicidal”? Possibly Protestantism is as weak and powerless as such a condition of affairs would indicate. But we very greatly doubt it.—*Christian at Work.*
