# Some Pertinent Questions.

WHILE some of the advocates of Sunday laws are still urging the passage and the enforcement of such laws in the interest of religion, others are more wise, even if less honest, and are pleading for a "civil sabbath" for "civil reasons." In a recent discourse in Denver, Rev. W. F. Crafts said: "It is genuine labor reform, this six-day law."

> "There is a general agreement," said he, "that the rest day must be made, by law. When men think that ten hours out of twenty-four is enough for work, it is incorporated in law, and everybody thinks it all right. Our movement is a six-day one, and on a par with the ten or eight-hour law." But where is the parallel? No ten or eight-hour law ever made, forbade men to work more than eight or ten hours; such laws simply forbid employers to require men to work more than eight or ten hours for a day's wages; if the men themselves are willing to work extra time, they may do so. But Sunday laws forbid work upon a certain day; they aim to protect not the employee, but the *day.*

If the real purpose of Sunday legislation is to prevent men from being required to do unnecessary work upon Sunday, [213] why do the advocates of such legislation not ask that the day be made a legal holiday, and that employers be required to pay double wages for all work done upon that day—with the provision also that a claim for such extra wages shall never outlaw, and that no agreement on the part of an employee shall be a bar to the collection of such wages? Such a law would stop all the unnecessary Sunday work now carried on, and give working people every advantage that they could justly claim on the score of a *right* to rest; and at the same time it would leave all who wish to labor on their own account free to do so, as they are not now in some States. But no law whatever is really necessary to secure to every man the right to rest.

While upon the Pacific Coast, a few weeks since, Mr. Crafts was asked if a Saturday law was not necessary to protect the Jew in the religious observance of the seventh day. Mr. Crafts replied: "It is not sufficiently emphasized that the Jew is left absolutely free to observe the seventh day. He can close his shop; he can refuse to work." Mr. Crafts is quite right in this answer; but it is just as true of the Sunday keeper: he can refuse to work. If the demand was as general as Mr. Crafts would have us believe, men would strike for Sunday rest just as they now do for shorter hours and higher wages. But nobody ever heard of a strike against Sunday work.

But Mr. Crafts, though professedly working for a civil law for the protection of a civil rest day, is not content to place the seventh-day observer and the first-day observer upon the same footing as regards the law. He not only wants to provide that nobody shall be compelled to work upon the first day, but that nobody shall be permitted to work upon that day, with these exceptions: "We concede," says he, "that three exceptions must be made—for labors of necessity, mercy, and for those who keep Saturday, the latter to work behind closed doors." But why behind closed doors, Mr. Crafts? If the law is only for the protection of labor, only to prevent men from being *compelled* to work on Sunday, why provide that those who want to work upon that day shall do it behind closed doors? There can be but one reason, namely, to place Sunday work under the ban of the law, and merely tolerate it just as Protestant worship is tolerated in some of the South American countries, behind high walls and in buildings not having any outward resemblance to churches.

Referring to Mr. Crafts' work, the Denver *News*, of June 17, well says:—

> It needs no analysis to see the drift of the legislation he advocates. He would have the civil power enforce a religious conception of Sunday observance, save that he would forego compulsory attendance at church.

One fact is, that look at the matter from whatever point of view you will, the real design of Sunday laws is to protect and honor the day, not to protect the men who might otherwise labor upon that day. This fact is "not sufficiently emphasized;" indeed, it is even denied by the American Sabbath Union.
