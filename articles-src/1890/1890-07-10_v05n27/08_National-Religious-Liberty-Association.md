# National Religious Liberty Association.

## Declaration Of Principles.

> We believe in the religion taught by Jesus Christ.

> We believe in temperance, and regard the liquor traffic as a curse to society.
> We believe in supporting the civil government, and submitting to its authority.
> We deny the right of any civil government to legislate on religious questions.
> We believe it is the right, and should be the privilege, of every man to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience.
> We also believe it to be our duty to use every lawful and honorable means to prevent religious legislation by the civil government; that we and our fellow-citizens may enjoy the in estimable blessings of both religious and civil liberty.
C. ELDREDGE, *President.*

W. H. MCKEE, *Secretary.*

IN Arkansas, State Secretary D. Nettleton has been doing some very effective work for the Association in the distribution of Religious Liberty literature. It is expected that at the session of the Legislature, the coming winter, another effort will be made to increase the stringency of the Sunday laws in that State.

IN an editorial on the “True Basis of Sabbath Laws,” in its issue of May 29, the *Christian Statesman* ‘unintentionally draws a comparison which does indeed show conclusively the true basis of civil laws for the observance of Sunday, as it existed in the mind of the writer. The article says:—

> The principle of Judaism would make the seventh day of the week our civil Sabbath. The principle of Mohammedanism would make the sixth day our civil day of rest. But our law has no such connection with Judaism or Mohammedanism. It has a connection however with Christianity.

Judaism would make the seventh day, Mohammedanism the sixth day, and Christianity the first day, our civil Sabbath.

By this collocation the authority of the three is equal and similar, each in its own sphere.

Nothing more is required to show the falsity of this position than to ask whether the authority of Christianity, or Judaism rests upon the same basis as Mohammedanism, and whether Judaism enforced the observance of the Sabbath by the same authority from which Mohammedanism derives its right to enforce its rest day, and whether *true* Christianity bears the same relation to Judaism, which Mohammedanism does to Judaism?

No religion enforced by, and observed in obedience to, a civil statute can be anything else than a man-made religion. Mohammedanism is a man-made religion, and the legal Christianity proposed by the *Statesman* would be no better, for it would be liable to all manner of human perversions and corruptions.W. H. M. [199-200]

IT is stated that a wealthy citizen of Minneapolis, Minnesota, has announced his intention to spend $50,000, if necessary, to prevent one of the theaters of that city from giving Sunday performances hereafter.

IN the American Bible Society, at its annual session in this city, it was stated that during the past eight years, 750,000 families in this country have been found without Bibles, and almost 300,000 of these families refused the Bible even as a gift. That is another argument which goes to show how this is “a Christian Nation.”

WE recently selected for our columns an article from one of the great religious papers of this city which we thought exceptionally good, and which we designed printing with proper credit. It was put into type, and came very near getting into the page before we noticed that it contained an entire paragraph which had been plagiarized bodily from the *Sun. *We have no objection to the *Sun;* indeed we think it a very good paper, but we feel ashamed to think that one of our leading religious papers is compelled to steal editorials from a secular paper. It is probably true that there is honor among thieves, that is, among ordinary thieves, but it is scarcely true of literary pirates.

ABOUT the only thing in which the advocates of Sunday laws are perfectly agreed among themselves is, that they should have Sunday laws. But when it comes to the basis for the required legislation, they find themselves unable to agree. The National Reformers repudiate the idea of the “civil Sabbath.” They maintain that the only proper ground for Sunday laws is the law of God, and very properly say that to admit any human authority or civil policy, would be to admit the right of the State to fix, and consequently to change the Sabbath; and to take this position would be virtually to say that were the State to change the day, they would also change their practice in the observance of the day.

But many, even among Christian ministers, assert that there is a civil basis for Sunday laws, and that they ask for such legislation, not on religious, but on civil and utilitarian grounds. This idea is made prominent by the American Sabbath Union, and by those who are working in harmony with them. It was the central thought in a recent Sunday law meeting held in Oakland, California, at which the Council of that city were requested to pass a Sunday-closing ordinance on purely “civil grounds.” But to show the confusion which existed in the minds of the leaders of the meeting it is only necessary to say that the resolutions adopted, used repeatedly the term “the Christian Sabbath,” and closed with these words: “We hereby express our decided conviction that the City Council should, without delay, pass an ordinance that will close all the saloons on the Sabbath day.” This shows that it is not the “civil Sabbath,” so called, which they wish to preserve, but the religious institution insisted upon by the National Reformers. It also shows the fact that nobody recognizes a “civil Sabbath;” that is, a Sabbath having any basis other than the authority of the Church or the authority of God.

THE President of the American Sabbath Union recommends his Saturday evening paper for Sunday reading. But the one objection that takes precedence of all others against the *Sunday* newspaper is that the reading of it keeps many people from church, and that those who read it and go to church are very much hindered in their devotions, and their listening to the sermon while at church. Now will not the reading of Mr. Shepard’s Saturday evening paper on Sunday have the same effect? And if so, will the American Sabbath Union advocate the abolition of Mr. Shepard’s Saturday evening paper? If not, why not?

THE *Converted Catholic* of this city says that “it is painfully true that former priests, and even converted priests, will receive ample compensation for their services in denouncing Popery in all its phases, and especially if they speak of the immorality and wickedness of Jesuit priests and nuns, but they can starve if they try to preach the gospel to the Roman Catholics.” This simply shows that the contest between Catholics and Protestants is no longer one of principle but is simply a fight for advantage. This is further shown by the fact that Protestants are so ready to adopt Catholic methods and invoke the aid of the civil power to advance their interests.

REV. THOMAS DIXON, JR., pastor of the Twenty-third Street Baptist Church, of this city, is credited with the following sensible utterance concerning the Sunday paper:—

> In my humble opinion the Sunday newspaper has come to stay. It is useless to rave and talk wild talk on this subject. You cannot destroy it. It has a mission. Why not cease our efforts to destroy, and seek to convert it and make its great cylinders to throb with the great truth of the living God, and send its messages of love and faith circling round the world? The Sunday newspaper is no rival of the pulpit. To be candid, I would rather, myself, read a live newspaper than listen to a dead man try to preach. The preacher who cannot hold his own against cold type is not called to preach, and the sooner he quits trying to preach, the better for him and the better for the cause he represents.

The only answer that can be given to Mr. Dixon’s query is that the gospel which the Sunday-law advocates proclaim is not one which seeks to convert, but one which seeks to compel; it is not a gospel of moral suasion but of physical force. Mr. Dixon’s would be the better plan, but it can never be popular with those who having departed from the spirit of the gospel have imbibed the spirit of the Inquisition.

UPON the action of the late Presbyterian General Assembly upon the subject of religion and education, the *Sun* pointedly remarks:—

The Presbyterians want religious instruction in our public schools.

But how can we have it in this republic, where the Church and the State are wholly separate? What religion shall we teach? Shall it be Christianity or Buddhism, Judaism or the doctrines taught by Jesus?

The Presbyterians assail the Roman Church as the enemy of the school system; and yet they are joining forces with it in demanding religious education as a necessary part of the public-school system.

THE *Pacific Union*, a California labor paper, has the following:—

> When Mr. Gompers was asked what would be wanted after the eight-hour day, he answered, “More.” And then what? “More.” But how much more, Mr. Gompers? “Why, not one iota less than the full fruit of his toil. Put that on your banner.”

Mr. Gompers does not say who will employ labor under such conditions, nor where the capital is to come from to inaugurate, and to support in their infancy the various enterprises that are to return to the laborer the full fruit of his toil. Such a demand, if general, would bring starvation to hundreds of thousands of homes, that under our present industrial system know no want. [201]
