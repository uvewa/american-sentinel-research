THE Supreme Court of Indiana has decided that a will drafted on Sunday is valid, and that such labor is not in violation of the law forbidding "common labor" on Sunday, and holds that there is a "wide distinction between the execution of contracts, notes, and bonds on Sunday, and the execution of a will." It is well that the Court so decided, else it must also have forbidden dying upon Sunday, since it might easily happen that a man, neglecting to make his will upon Sunday, would die before Monday and so leave no will.
