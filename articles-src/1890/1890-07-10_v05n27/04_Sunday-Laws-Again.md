# Sunday Laws Again

WE are glad to be in harmony with others whenever it is possible, and we find we are in harmony with Brother Mc Creery in several particulars. We agree with him that no Sabbath laws should be passed for the enforcement of the Sabbath as a religious ordinance, and we also fully agree with him that workingmen and all others should be protected in the observance of the Sabbath; and we further agree with him fully that the “Sabbath was made for man,” to be a blessing spiritually and temporally, and we are sure that if all would observe the Sabbath day they would be in better health, live longer and be far happier. So far we are agreed. Wherein then is the Sundayrest Bill wrong? We answer that the object of the bill is to enforce the observance of a religious ordinance. Article 2, of the constitution of the American Sabbath Union, contains the following: “The basis of this Union is the divine authority and perpetual obligation of the Sabbath.” In the writings and speeches of many of its strong supporters the claim is boldly put forth that God is visiting our Nation in judgments, because of a failure to recognize him in the Constitution, and Christ as the ruler of the Nation, by appropriate legislation. The Johnstown flood, the Louisville cyclone, and the fire by which Secretary Tracy was bereaved, are cited as acts of God, by which his wrath is shown toward the United States because, as a Nation, we refuse to keep Sunday.

These are the persons who are clamoring for the passage of the Blair Sundayrest Bill, and all this talk about the movement being for the purpose of “protecting” the workingman is a sugar coating over the real pill which is being prepared for the people to swallow.

The terms of the bill show that the object is not “protection,” but compulsion: “Any person laboring on Sunday shall be fined not less than $10 or more than $1,000,” more than a year’s wages forfeited for daring to labor. “Any person receiving pay for laboring on Sunday may have it taken from him by whoever shall first sue for the same.” It does seem strange that any one should argue that those terms only mean to “protect” those who wish to be religious and to observe Sunday.

Taking it for granted as assumed, that all that is intended is “protection,” let us try the same argument in another way. We are agreed that the daytime is for labor and that the night is for sleep. Men would be healthier and in many ways benefited by following this rule and many men are now laboring in the night time, to their detriment. We, therefore, feel a great interest in “protecting” them and proceed to pass a law that if Brother Mc Creery is found at his study or workbench after 9 o’clock in the evening “he shall be fined not more than $1,000” and if he receives pay for the same, I may recover it from him and use his night wages for myself. Would you call that protection?

A majority of the people conclude that men would live longer, have better health and be happier if they regularly used soup. It is a God-given right which all have to use soup. It may be that this idea is traditional and has been handed down to us from a soup country, and it may also be true that with these who praise and laud soup so very highly it is used as a religious rite, but that is neither here nor there. “Soup is good for man,” and the workingman must be protected in this, his God-given right to eat soup. The workingmen may appear by their representatives and say, “Leave that soup business alone; we will get our rights without your aid.” In our extreme anxiety for “protection” we formulate our law and when it is completed, it provides that Brother Mc Creery, with others, must regularly and at stated intervals take his soup, and he must take it at the same time those who use it as a religious rite take theirs, and a failure to do so makes him liable to a fine of not over $1,000, all because soup is good for man, and man must be “protected” in his right to eat soup. Brother Mc Creery may have conscientious scruples about eating his soup on the stated day and may have eaten his the day before. That makes no difference; the law must be enforced or at least can be enforced, and it may be that the “less enlightened” States may enforce the law to the detriment of his particular stomach, but the more “enlightened States” might be “tolerant” and not wish to disturb our worthy brother.

How is that for “protection”? yet it is just the same as this Sunday protection.

> The statement that the States which are the least advanced are the ones where Seventh-day observers are persecuted, and the more enlightened States are tolerant, is the best argument against any such law. The more enlightened States see the absurdity of such a law and will not enforce it, while the States that are behind make the lot of one class hard, because they can do so with a bad law. The fault is with the law and not with the people.—*J. D. Pegg*, *in Fort Collins*,* Colorado, Courier*.
