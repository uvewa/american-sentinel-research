# The History of the Bennett Law.

THE history and the provisions of the Illinois and Wisconsin Statutes and the steps officially taken in both States to construe and enforce them will show that those who have positive convictions as to the place of the parent in the domain of education had just ground of apprehension if not of complaint; while, on the other hand, those who entertain positive or even advanced views on the relation of the State to education will, on learning what is really opposed, find much in the Illinois Statute and something in the Bennett Law that may be omitted or amended without impairing the just rights of society or the State, and without at all interfering with the development of the elements most to be desired in a system of universal education.

Like individuals and all things within the State, both kinds of schools are amenable to the powers of the State to an extent measured by the necessities of the common welfare, but the public schools, being the creation of the State, bear a relation to the State control not shared in by the private schools, which are the creation of voluntary individual action.

For some years it was observed in the city of Chicago that a considerable number of children of school age were loitering on the streets and in public places, with evident injury to their moral and physical well-being. Other children, in much greater numbers, were put to labor in shops, factories, and stores at an immature age, and it was considered that such practices were injurious, not only to the children, but to society. As to the children that wandered upon the streets, it was felt that in some cases blame attached to parents; in other cases that the children were beyond the control of their parents.

These conditions and the agitation arising from them among the people and various organizations, in the press and in the Board of Education, resulted in the appointment of a committee by the President of the Board of Education to frame acts to be presented to the General Assembly of the State of Illinois, then in session. Three bills were drawn and [197] submitted to a public meeting of citizens embracing all shades of opinion on the subject of education and religion; were approved by that meeting; subsequently approved by the Board of Education, and the Board appointed a committee, other than those that had framed the bills, to take these proposed laws to Springfield and cause them to be introduced in the Legislature. These three bills were introduced in the House of Representatives on March 7, 1889, and became known as follows:—

> House Bill No. 531, a bill for an act regarding truant children.

> House Bill No. 547, a bill for an act prohibiting child labor.
> House Bill No. 557, a bill for an act concerning the education of children.
These three bills were referred to committees of the House and the first two of them were not acted upon thereafter by the House, and so did not become laws. The third bill passed the House, I believe, was sent to the Senate, and in the Senate there was substituted for it a bill which was commonly supposed to have been prepared by the State Superintendent of Instruction, and which became a law. This bill differs radically in several respects from the bill which was prepared and generally approved in Chicago, and it is to the objectionable features of this bill that it would seem, the whole controversy, both in Illinois and Wisconsin, is due.

The bill that passed the Illinois Legislature permits and even invites harsh, unnecessary, and illegal prosecution against parents. It undertakes to vest in Boards of Education and Boards of Directors authority and jurisdiction over private day schools, and subjects these to the approval of such Boards, without which they cannot, according to the act, exist. Several prosecutions have taken place in the State of Illinois under this act, while not a single prosecution has taken place in the State of Wisconsin under the so-called Bennett Law.

This brings us to consider what is the Bennett Law, and what were the circumstances preceding, surrounding and succeeding its enactment.

The Wisconsin Legislature was in session during the winter of 1888-9. There was presented in that Legislature a bill known as the Pond Bill. The announced object of this Pond Bill was to secure statistics from all schools in the State of Wisconsin, public, private, and denominational, touching several matters connected with the schools. The provisions of this bill were regarded as somewhat sweeping and inquisitorial. Agitation against the bill was widespread throughout the State, and it was defeated.

About this time, whether because of the defeat of the Pond Bill or not, I am not advised, copies of the three bills which had been prepared in Chicago, presented to the Illinois Legislature and defeated, were run together and introduced as one bill in the Legislature of Wisconsin by Mr. Bennett, and it was announced, and repeated over and over again, and became generally accepted as true throughout the State of Wisconsin that the Bennett Bill, which in fact consisted of three bills on three very different, though related, subjects, was a copy of the Compulsory School Law, enacted in Illinois, and hence it came to pass that unjust prosecutions under the Illinois law were regarded as liable to be duplicated at any time in the State of Wisconsin.

Those who were alarmed and exasperated by these Illinois prosecutors, all of them not being conversant with the rules of construction of statutes, and in many cases without having carefully studied the Bennett Law itself, grew to have an antipathy toward it because of what they supposed it to be. The blunder, to use no stronger term, of passing in Illinois a crude and defective law was followed in Wisconsin by the blunder of merging three separate bills, each containing machinery for its own enforcement by pains and penalties, and passing the whole as one bill, which seemed, as was said in one of the protests made against it, “to bristle with penalties.”

The opposition to the Bennett Law was the result principally of the belief that it was the same as the Illinois law, which law permitted and authorized harassing and illegal interference, on the part of School Boards, with parental rights. And so the controversy grew, on one side persons believing that their parental and even religious rights were being unjustly interfered with, and on the other hand, persons believing that the opposition to the Bennett Law was opposition to popular education, opposition to the public school law, and opposition to the development of a high standard of citizenship.—*Judge Prendergast, Chicago*.
