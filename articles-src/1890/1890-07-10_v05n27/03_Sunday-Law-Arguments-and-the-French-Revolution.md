CRITICISING certain so-called Sundaylaw arguments the *Western Herald* of Burlington, Iowa, says:—

> Facts are worth stating, even in a church and at a meeting whose aim is the civil enforcement of a religious institution. The speaker who asserted that the French Revolution was the result of the abolishment of Sunday, the so-called day of rest, and the substitution therefor of every tenth day in its stead, was either quite uninformed or wilfully perversive. The causes of that Revolution were multiplex—but chiefly due to the poverty of the masses who had long been preyed upon by the nobility, the common people seemingly being regarded as born only for the use of the upper class. Atheism was widely prevalent, it cannot be denied, but it was largely the outgrowth of the oppression and flagrant immorality of the ruling classes.

Yes, facts are worth stating; but those who plead for compulsory Sunday observance are not as careful to state facts as they should be. The fact that it was the abuses practiced by a corrupt church that more than anything else caused the atheism which was so pronounced in France at the time of the Revolution, would not be of service to their cause, and so they don't state it. They find it more convenient, even if less logical, to attribute that atheism to what were in fact some of its results.
