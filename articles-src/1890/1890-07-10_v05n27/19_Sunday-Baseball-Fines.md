A SPRINGFIELD, Ohio, dispatch says:—

> Canton and Springfield played the first Sunday game of ball, on Sunday, before 3,000 people, notwithstanding the ministers' vigorous protest. Monday morning, by pre-arrangement of the baseball management, Constable Parsons arrested managers and players. In Squire Miller's court they pleaded guilty, and each was fined twenty-five cents and costs. The latter will be thrown off. Church-going people are kicking over the fines imposed by the Justice, and there is likely to be some fun later.

That seems strange. We are confidently assured by very many people that Sunday laws are not religious, but police regulations for the health of the people. If that were true it. would seem that boards of health, and not the church people, should do the "kicking" when Sunday laws are violated.
