SPEAKING of the Non-Partisan Woman's Christian Temperance Union, the *Independent* of this city says: "We most heartily commend it to those who want to do temperance work without complication with political parties." And so do we; and not only so, but we suggest that every Christian ought to want to do temperance work in just that way.
