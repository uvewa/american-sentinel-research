# Unique Legislation.

THE last clause of the Blair Sunday-rest Bill, is worded as follows:—

> Nor shall the provisions of this act be construed to prohibit or sanction labor on Sunday, by individuals who conscientiously believe in and observe any other day than Sunday as the Sabbath, or a day of religious worship, provided that such labor be not done to the disturbance of others.

This is unique. No such legislation as this was ever before offered in this country. The restrictions of the Bill, if passed, would bear upon all persons within the exclusive jurisdiction of Congress,—the District of Columbia, the Territories, ships on the high seas, military and naval stations, military and naval service; the postal service, and those engaged in inter-state commerce and trade with the Indians.

The influence of such a measure would not be as circumscribed as some of its promoters would have us think. Its restrictions upon the postal service, and interstate commerce, would cause its effects to be seen, and its results manifested in every corner of the land. Those who planned it, well know this, and have worked accordingly. But from the effects of this far-reaching law, they make an ostensible exception. What is it? It specifies a certain class of people, who are characterized in the bill, as "individuals who conscientiously believe in and observe any other day than Sunday, as the Sabbath or a day of religious worship," and declares that, as regards them, the bill is non-committal. Concerning this class, it withdraws its prohibition, but at the same time refuses its sanction. As regards them, it refuses to legislate.

These people who "conscientiously believe," etc., are therefore thrown outside the pale of the law. They are ignored in the laws of the United States. They are outlaws. There is something so darkly mysterious in their case, that Congress cannot acknowledge their existence, but must deny itself to them utterly, either in favor or displeasure.

But who is it that thus assumes to ask for the outlawry of a body of American citizens? It is a number of men who form the nucleus of a party known as the National Reform Association, and who deny their own citizenship, and refuse to exercise their right of suffrage. This Government, and the people (who are the Government), should consider whether "conscientious" citizens who obey the law, pay their taxes, and value their franchise, using it for the benefit of their country, should be scorned and outlawed, at the demand of a few men who are aliens by choice—voluntary aliens, because the great founders of this republic were too intelligently and profoundly reverent to embody the name of God in the civil document upon which the polity of this Nation is based. Shall the Congress of the United States say of any person or any class of persons within its jurisdiction, "We wash our hands of you;" "We neither prohibit nor sanction your acts;" "We deliver you up to the Committees of One Hundred, to the Law-and-Order leagues, and to the White Caps"? If this can be accomplished by a demand from such a source, who governs this country? and who may not come next under the ban of outlawry?
