# St. James and the Vatican.

THE following we clip from the San Francisco *Examiner*, of May 30:—

> London, May 30.—The appointment of Judge Andriano Dingle, Chief Justice of Malta, as English Ambassador to the Vatican, is the outcome of the mission of Sir Mintern Simmons to the Vatican, and has reference alone to Malta.

> There is nothing in the appointment which need alarm those earnest Englishmen who are inclined to take fire at the opening of diplomatic relations with the Papacy. It is forgotten by many well-meaning people that the British flag floats over a very considerable Roman Catholic population in various parts of the world, and that the crown has taken control over territory in which, by solemn treaty, all the religious rights of Catholics are guaranteed.
> Such is the position in Lower Canada, in a section of India, in the West Indies and in Malta, and if ever it seems to call for modification, the British Government of the day must trample arbitrarily upon all its pledges or open negotiations with the papal authorities.

> The canon law is the civil law of Malta. Her Majesty's government desired a certain concession regarding the validation of marriages, the use of English by the clergy, and the appointment of bishops, and all that is required has practically been obtained.
We wish to call attention to the following points:—

1. Such negotiations between England and the Papacy would once have been considered by Englishmen as little less than treason.

2. It would be so considered now were not the Papacy a power which England dares not ignore. The fact that England has taken such a step shows the increased power and influence of the Papacy in European affairs.

3. The fact of the negotiations proves that the Roman Catholic Church is not only an ecclesiastical power, but a political power.

4. The second paragraph quoted is the thinnest sort of fallacy. Because England rules over Roman Catholic subjects, does it follow that she must negotiate with the Vatican and send an ambassador to St. Peter's? Does she rule over her people as members of different sects, or as British subjects? If the fact that there are many Roman Catholics in the dominion of Great Britain is reason why the British Government should send an ambassador to the head of that church, ought not that Government, to be consistent, to open negotiations with other religious denominations? There are many Wesleyans, and Presbyterians, and Congregationalists, in the British dominions. Why is not an ambassador sent to their General Conferences? The Salvation Army has many thousands of British subjects. Why should not an ambassador be kept at the royal palace of General Booth?

5. The action ought to alarm every true Englishman. The conclusion is unavoidable; an English ambassador at the Vatican is a recognition of the temporal sovereignty of the Pope. A proposition to open negotiations from the head of any other sect would be treated with ridicule or silent contempt by the Court at St. James. But the Roman Catholic is no more entitled to it than is the smallest sect in the dominions of Her Britannic Majesty. As was remarked by a leading London journal a few years ago, Rome is a power which must be taken into account in solving the great questions of the day. Both England and Germany are finding it to be the case more and more. The outcome of it all is revealed in the prophetic word.—Signs of the Times.
