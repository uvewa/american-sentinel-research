SECTARIAN instruction should be sedulously excluded from the public schools of the land. The Catholics, as they have a right to do, object even to the reading of the Protestant Bible in such schools: but now comes Rev. Charles O. Brown, of Dubuque, in a letter to the Des Moines *Capital,* saying there are "at least seven district schools in Dubuque County where the Catholic catechism is taught." A church so strenuous in preventing unwelcome reading in the presence of its children should not employ the public funds to promote their doctrines, nor expect that other people will be willing to have it done.—*The Lyons, Iowa, Mirror.*
