JUNE 2, Joseph Keeter and Joseph Barnett, of Indianapolis, were fined by Mayor Sullivan for taking photographs on Sunday. The former, with costs, paid $19.50 and the latter paid $13.25. Both were amateurs engaged in taking landscapes. George Wilson and Ruth Keeter were arrested for the same offense, but their cases were continued. Laws that make such things possible ought to be promptly abolished. We suppose, however, that the Indiana Sunday law is simply a "civil regulation" to "preserve the health of the people" by keeping them from working too hard. It might not occur to many that amateur photography is necessarily either very hurtful physically or morally, but they forget that this was done on Sunday.

Sunday is a very peculiar day. It would no doubt be all right for the Mayor of Indianapolis to take his carriage and enjoy a drive on Sunday, or for any number of people to devote the day to feasting and visiting, but taking photographs of landscapes is not to be tolerated.
