THE *Kansas Worker,* the organ of the Kansas Tract Society, says: "A true advocate of temperance will want the saloons closed every day in the week, and a law to that end can be enforced as well as a law that only closes them on Sunday. Such a law, instead of being in the interest of *temperance,* is in the interest of *Sunday." *The *Worker* tells the truth, as all religious papers should. Of course all papers, and all persons, too, ought to tell the truth; and we wish they would.
