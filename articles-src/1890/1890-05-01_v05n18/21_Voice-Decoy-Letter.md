BY means of a "decoy" letter the *Voice *obtained an interview with the manager of last year's anti-Prohibition campaign in Pennsylvania; and in the interview it got a great host of matter that with great delight it published to the world. In the interview certain prominent and responsible men of Philadelphia were named, and certain things were said about them; but these men unanimously declare the statements to be without a particle of foundation in fact. Now the question presents itself, Who was it that was decoyed, the *Voice* or the other man? The *Voice* confessedly worked a deceitful trick to obtain information. How does the *Voice* know but what the other party did the same in giving the information? We confess that on reading the *Voice's* account, there was a certain air of open innocence amounting almost to verdancy, which is very seldom found amongst men of such political experience as the gentleman who was interviewed. It is certain that names were given, and statements were made, with such an air of recklessness as to cast doubt upon the whole thing by reason of its very extravagance.

Taking the whole case as it stands, so far, we cannot help wondering whether the *Voice's* decoy did not partake somewhat of the character of a boomerang. And the question is, Who was it that was decoyed?
