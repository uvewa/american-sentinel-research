THE case of R. M. King, in which he was fined seventy-five dollars for Sunday labor, by Judge Swiggart, in the Circuit Court of Obion County, Tennessee, and appealed to the Supreme Court, will be argued on appeal during the present term of court. The case will be reached some time in May. The similar case against L. A. Callicott in the Circuit Court of Dyer County, has been continued to await the action of the Supreme Court, in the appealed case of Mr. King.
