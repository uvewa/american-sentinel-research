THE *Daily Imprint,* of Petaluma, California, appropriately remarks:—

> Senator Blair has re-introduced his bill providing for a National Sabbath. Senator Blair has fathered many objectionable measures in his day and generation, and this is probably the least meritorious. It is contrary to the very genius and spirit of our institutions. If the generality of mankind cannot agree by unanimous consent upon the observance of a certain day, no attempt should be made to legislate them into the observance of any day.
