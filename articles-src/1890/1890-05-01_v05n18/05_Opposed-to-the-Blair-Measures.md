# Opposed to the Blair Measures.

THE Constitution of the United States declares that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.

Senator Blair introduced a joint resolution in the United States Senate, December 9, 1889, proposing to amend the Constitution of the United States so that *"no State"* shall ever make or maintain any law respecting an "establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." This is the first section of the article containing the proposed amendment. The second section proposes the establishment of "a system of free public schools" in which is to be included instruction "in the common branches of learning, in virtue and morality, and *in knowledge of the fundamental and nonsectarian principles of Christianity."*

The first section of this article is in accordance with the provision of the Constitution of the United States in regard to religious establishments, and is not particularly objectionable, but the second section is right in the teeth of the first, and in violation of the provision of the Constitution already existing. It is practically, a plain step in the direction of a religious establishment, organized and maintained by the federal Government.

The Blair Educational bill now pending in the United States Senate, and on which the author has been speaking for a week, is but a bait set upon a federal hook, to catch the unwary, and to lead them into the support of the joint resolution proposing the amendment alluded to above. Baptists are utterly opposed to everything that squints at union of Church and State. Let them speak out in no uncertain tones, in regard to these measures which promise nothing but evil to both.— *The Christian Index and Southern Baptist, Atlanta, Georgia, February 27, **1890.*
