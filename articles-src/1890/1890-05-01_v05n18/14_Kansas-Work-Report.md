C. MCREYNOLDS, State Secretary for Kansas, sends an interesting account of his work in that State. He finds it possible to accomplish more in the towns and villages, than in the large cities. The inhabitants of the cities are so preoccupied with business and pleasure, that it is more difficult to gain their attention upon abstract subjects.

In regard to the method to be followed in the lecture field, Secretary McReynolds says: "I would go only as fast as I could secure others to continue the work of circulating the petitions, and also, when it is possible, enlist one or more in handling the tracts, SENTINELS, and pamphlets."
