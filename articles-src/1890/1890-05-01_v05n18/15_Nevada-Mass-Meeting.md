THE *Nevada Tribune,* of March 20, published at Carson City, Nevada, contains an account of a mass-meeting held in the opera house of that city on the evening of March 19. The *Tribune* says:—

> There was an enthusiastic meeting at the Carson Opera House last evening, and it was clearly shown that the sentiment of the people of the capital of Nevada, was practically unanimous, against the passage of the proposed Blair Sunday rest bill, as well as intended legislation leading to the establishment of religion in the public schools of the land.

Resolutions were adopted, condemning the measures of religious legislation, involved in the Blair Sunday-rest bill, the Breckinridge Sunday bill for the District of Columbia, and the Blair amendments to the Constitution to provide for the teaching of the principles of religion in the schools.
