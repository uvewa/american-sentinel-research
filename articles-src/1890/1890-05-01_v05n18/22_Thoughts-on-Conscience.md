IN an article entitled, "Thoughts on Conscience," in *Word and Work,* Rev. E. Balley says:—

> A conscience illuminated and instructed by the word of God is free from condemnation, and is strong to bear the reproaches of men and the accusations of Satan. . . .

> Such a conscience is above the laws of men, and is not amenable to earthly tribunals. No civil power can have any control over the conscience. . . . In secular things we are to submit to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, but in all religious things we are left to God and our conscience.
This is true, and it does not alter the case a particle to call civil that which is religious.
