BOUND volumes of the *Pacific Health Journal* for 1888 and 1889, published at Oakland, California, have found their way to our table and are most welcome visitors. These volumes are neatly and substantially bound in half roan, and present a very neat appearance. But it is the contents of the volumes which make them valuable. They abound in useful information and practical every-day hints which cannot fail to be exceedingly helpful to every one who cares to profit by them. The volumes are well worth the price at which they sell. They may be ordered together, or singly, from the Pacific Press, Oakland, Cal. Price, post-paid, $2.25 per volume. [145]
