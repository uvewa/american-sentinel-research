IN the *Christian Nation,* of March 26, Rev. John A. Dodds discusses the Wisconsin Supreme Court decision on the Bible in the schools. He declares that according to this decision "Wisconsin is well on the way toward the religion and morality of the Hottentots and of the French revolutionists;" and that, "if the Supreme Court of Wisconsin has interpreted the Constitution aright in this respect, it is certainly a covenant with death and an agreement with hell." He says, "It is un- American, unchristian, and in the light of our past history, it is a falsehood." He announces that the "condition of things in that State will bring the wrath of Almighty God on the whole Nation if it be allowed to continue," and quotes "Shall not my soul be avenged on such a Nation as this?" He calls it "The surrender of the *magna charta* of our American Protestant Christian liberty." He supports his statement by the following piece of logic:—

> Bible morality and Bible religion is the parentage of every State in the Union, therefore the command to honor thy father and thy mother is binding on all the States individually and unitedly. "He that wasteth his father and chaseth away his mother, is a son that bringeth reproach." Prov. 19:26. Reproach in this case attaches to all the members of the family.

And upon this he calls loudly for the removal of this reproach, by having the Constitution of the United States "so amended as to give an undeniable legal basis" to Christianity, or rather to what the theological instructors shall declare is Christianity.
