# Follies of the Wise.

IT seems from a Washington dispatch printed in the *Boston Advertiser,* that Mr.. Edmunds is still meditating upon his proposed national university at Washington,, and is even thinking of making the establishment of such an institution a memorial and celebration of the discovery of America:—

> Senator Edmunds, in speaking about the Chicago World's Fair bill to-day, said that he did not intend to antagonize that measure when it comes up for consideration, but that he did propose to bring forward at as early a day as possible his National University bill.

> He said he intended to have had the measure matured some time ago, but owing to a severe illness from which he had not entirely recovered, he had been unable to give the subject the attention it required.
> That it would carry with it a large sum of money to be appropriated from the treasury of the United States; and whether it should be a commemoration of the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus, was for the Senate to determine.
It is very kind of Mr. Edmunds to think of Christopher Columbus, but it would be still kinder of him to think of the American people. Leaving out of question the absurdity and impropriety of a national university, the absence of constitutional warrant for the establishment and maintenance of such an institution by the Government, the political squabbles and scandals and the educational anomalies which would inevitably result, and the difficulty of organizing a faculty, and, in certain branches of knowledge, of providing instructors who would not be objectionable to large sections of public opinion; leaving out of sight all these tough questions, there is still one question which should be enough to gravel Mr. Edmunds or any other fine old Federalist - Republican. What right has the Government to tax everybody for the benefit of the few students who would have the time and the means to resort to a national university?

There are colleges enough and universities enough, and to spare, in the United States already. The only truly national university possible to this country is the primary school. There can't be too much of that. There can't be too little of such a national humbug as Mr. Edmunds proposes.

We entreat Mr. Edmunds not to associate the name of Columbus with a humbug.—*New York Sun.*
