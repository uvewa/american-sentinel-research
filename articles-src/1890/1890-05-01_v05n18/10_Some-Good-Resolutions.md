# Some Good Resolutions.

WE wish the Woman’s National Liberal Union were as sound in all its statements and all its principles, as it is in the following resolutions which were adopted at its Washington Convention. These resolutions are good. We wish we could say as much of everything that was said in the Convention, but we are glad that there is so much that is so good. May these principles permeate the organization until all shall be alike good:—

> *Resolved,* That it is essential to the life of the Republic that the purely civil character of the Government be maintained and that Church and State be forever kept separate; that the legal foundation of our Government is not any creed of Christendom, nor any authority of the Church, nor a divine revelation, but it is simply the consent of the governed; that the State has not grown out of the Church, but should outgrow the need of any Church and be henceforth and forever independent of the Church.

> *Resolved,* That the efforts now made by the Christian party to bring religion into politics in order to place a religious amendment in the Constitution of the United States, must be resisted, because the [134] success of such efforts would make the Church the arbiter of the legislative functions of the Government and place dangerous irresponsible power in the hands of the priesthood.
> *Resolved,* That according to the principles of the Government of the United States of America, the Church and State are and must be forever kept separate. The State should govern its civil affairs, give its protection to every form of religious belief and secure freedom from molestation to every sect in the exercise of its religious sentiments, and therefore any amendment to the Constitution proposed by the so-called Christian party in politics is destructive of existing civil liberty and should be energetically opposed.
> *Resolved,* That the real endeavor of the Christian party in politics is to establish a Papacy in place of the present secular form of government of the United States; that a Papacy does not alone mean a Pope’s one-man power in the Church, nor a claim of Papal infallibility; nor an immoral pretense of power to bind or loose sins, nor the celebration of mass, nor use of holy water, nor the making of marriage a sacrament, nor the doctrine of extreme unction, nor consecrated ground for burial, nor the claim of any number of sacraments, nor the establishment of parochial schools to teach children what they cannot understand, nor a celibate priesthood, nor any form of theological doctrine regarding heaven, hell, or purgatory; but that a Papacy is any Church asserting divine authority for its teachings and therefore claiming the right to exercise civil power,—whether that Church calls itself Roman, Greek, Anglican, or Protestant.
> *Resolved,* That the centralization of power, whether in the Church or in the State, is dangerous to civil liberty and to individual rights, and therefore all attempts towards such centralization, either in Church or State, must be constantly and firmly opposed.
> *Resolved,* That as our Nation is composed of people holding various and conflicting religious views, Roman Catholics disagreeing with Protestant forms, both disagreeing with Jewish rites, and the Agnostic holding to no defined system, therefore it is wrong and unjust to impose religious instruction of any kind upon the pupils of our common schools, and in simple justice to all people we denounce and oppose every kind of religious instruction in our public schools.
THE newspapers that attack the Supreme Court of Wisconsin for its decision that the reading of the Bible in the public schools of that State is in violation of the Constitution, are more enthusiastic than wise. The matter is one of law purely. The judges, as we are advised, are Christian men; and while no doubt they would like to see the Bible read in all the public schools of the State, that is no reason why they should put the Constitution aside. Besides, the question relates to a particular version which the Catholics do not accept.

The starting point of the whole matter is the constantly recurring one of sectarianism in the public schools, in which religion cannot be introduced free from sectarianism. The Wisconsin court is undoubtedly right in its position, some well meaning newspapers to the contrary notwithstanding. Certain it is that the reading in the public schools of the Douay, or Roman Catholic, version of the Bible would be denounced by the Protestant world as secular instruction prohibited by the Constitution. The reading of the King James version is no less so. Let us have peace.—*Christian at Work.*
