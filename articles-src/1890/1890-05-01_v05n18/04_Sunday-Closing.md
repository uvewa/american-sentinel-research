# Sunday Closing.

THE *Colorado Graphic* declares that Sunday closing in Denver is a failure. “Sunday drinking,” it says, “goes on as merrily as though the law did not exist.” And this without violation of the statute. “The greedy consumer,” says the *Graphic,* “has found legal loopholes through which to crawl, and drinks more now in private than he did when barroom doors were wide open. The police are as powerless to suppress this Sunday drinking as they are to interfere with the Mayor’s or Sheriff’s claret at dinner if they choose to serve it. Private clubs have been organized and chartered all over the city. . . . One dollar pays a member’s initiation fee and buys a key to a club-room door—usually an annex to a licensed saloon. Twenty-five cents a month pays expenses, and he is provided with all his thirst demands from Sunday morning until Sunday night at regular rates.”

And this, is much the way Sunday closing works everywhere. If it closes the saloons, it does not keep people from getting liquor, as has been many times demonstrated; and as a temperance measure it is just about as effective as high license, which is now so generally repudiated by temperance people. Those who desire prohibition should demand it pure [131] and simple, and not waste their time with Sunday closing. If, however, that which is desired is State recognition of Sunday as being for some reason better than other days, Sunday-closing laws are certainly a step in the right direction.

This city has Sunday-closing laws, but it is notorious that it does not lessen the amount of drunkenness for the reason that people get and drink their liquor just the same as they used to before the saloons were closed on Sunday. Many buy it on Saturday evening. And again many saloons close only the front door while the side door remains open. It is openly charged that for this privilege they pay a regular monthly allowance to the police. Those who pay are not arrested; those who refuse are hurried off to prison and are fined, till driven out of the business. The only way to prohibit the liquor traffic is to prohibit it, not one day in the week but every day. To make criminal upon one day in the week that which is perfectly legal at all other times, is simply to place a premium upon official corruption; to make possible persecution, as in Tennessee; and to educate people to disregard and despise the law.
