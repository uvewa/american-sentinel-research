CHINA ought to be the ideal National Reform country. A Chinese mandarin can order a man's head to be cut off at any moment. But within three months he must forward to the Emperor an affidavit from two persons declaring that the execution *was in the interest of religion and morals.* He has no difficulty in getting such affidavits, as he can cut off the heads of any who refuse to make them.
