# Its Mission.

THE mission of the Religious Liberty Association is to present to the world, the principles of civil and religious liberty as taught by Christ. Those who do that acceptably, must be animated by his spirit. The following from the pen of A. F. Ballenger, Ass't Secretary of the Association, in the February *Home Missionary,* is worthy of the thoughtful attention of every solicitor, colporter, writer and lecturer of the Association.

It must be borne in mind that the work of the National Religious Liberty Association is a labor of love. It is a missionary work, and those engaged in it should be actuated by the same spirit which impelled the great Missionary to give its principles to the world eighteen hundred years ago.

Agitators of political principles expect to be victorious, and as a result of their labors, receive worldly positions of honor and profit. Not so with us; our victory, though sure, will not be celebrated until those who have "gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God." With the result of the work reaching into eternity, how careful we should be not to wound the feelings of those for whom we work, by harsh and unkind expressions. The most of those engaged in securing religious legislation are honest, and should be so regarded. This is proved from the fact that many who have signed the petition favoring religious legislation, have, when the matter was clearly and kindly presented to them, signed the counter-petition, and worked in its favor. These cases are not confined to the less intelligent, but ministers and members of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union are among them. The president of the Association recently stated the truth, when he said, "Were it not for the special light received, many of us would be on the side of error in this conflict."

Workers will meet, at times, with bitter opposition, but instead of being harsh or becoming discouraged, "consider Him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds."W. H. M.
