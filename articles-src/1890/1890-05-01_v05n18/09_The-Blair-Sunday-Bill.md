# The Blair Sunday Bill.

THE bill in its present form is objectionable and should, and probably will be, summarily rejected by Congress. It is objectionable because it contemplates a union of religion with the Government through legislation, and the experience of history proves that such a union is adulterous in character and defiling alike to religious and secular affairs. What is more to the point, it is contrary to the fundamental principles of our system and to the national Constitution, which has guaranteed—not toleration, but absolute religious freedom, so far as Congress has power to legislate. . . .

The United States republic made several distinct departures from previous experiences in government, but none exceeded in its vital consequence to humanity and in its relation to our national progress the severance of priestcraft and every shade of theocracy from our civil system. We have demonstrated that the absolute severance of organic religion from the State produces the greatest prosperity and the best results for both interests. The churches of no country have equal vitality with those of the United States, and in proportion to the influence that the Church has on the State affairs of any nation its religion will be found to be debased and stupefied, vice among its people rampant, and morality at a low ebb. The reader who will apply this statement to the nations in detail will conclude that nothing is so blighting to a nation’s morality, or so demoralizing to its religion, as an alliance of its ecclesiastical power with the State. The absolute severance of so corrupting a connection is the most vital characteristic of our Government.

No higher authority is recognized by the United States, as such, than the will of the people; as the fathers declared, “Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.” Lincoln expressed the American idea when he said this is “a Government of the people, by the people and for the people.” Our Government was formed and exists for the purposes of this world, and the affairs of the supernatural world were left to the individual conscience. Obviously under such a system there can be no legislation affecting religious belief or controlling action in the interest of any religion. Such legislation would imply force and to secure effect would require force, which would be persecution. Who wants to go back to that? Has not history been blackened enough in that way? Is not the record made by the Church in its ages of power mainly responsible for the present severance of a large proportion of the Christian world from Christianity?

It is true that in practice the principles of this Government have in certain particulars been violated, but the violations have been without warrant and cannot be defended as matters of right. We have reached a period when it will be wise to check farther advance in the wrong direction. The secular character of the Government cannot be too clearly recognized or too emphatically maintained. The founders of the Nation left the management of temporal things to the temporal power, and gave freedom of religion to all—not to Christians only, but to all whose form of belief does not conflict with the moral instincts of our civilization, a test of which may be had by a comparison with an authoritative criminal code. In 1796 a treaty made by the United States with Tripoli and drawn up by a Congregational clergyman declared that “the Government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion,” and it was signed by President Washington. The incident forcibly illustrates the sentiment of the time as to the secular nature of the Government; nor does it indicate an unfriendly feeling but on the contrary respect for religion and a desire to avoid an association that had always been defiling to both Church and State. “The American Constitution, in harmony with the people of the several States,” says Mr. Bancroft, in his History of the Constitution of the United States, “withheld from the Federal Government the power to invade the home of reason, the citadel of conscience, the sanctuary of the soul; and not from indifference, but that the infinite spirit of eternal truth might move in its freedom and purity of power.”

The Blair Sunday bill should be killed, because the good points it embraces would not justify the risk of such a precedent in legislation even were its defects removed, being confessedly a religious movement and to serve religious purposes.—*Rocky Mountain News, February 9.*
