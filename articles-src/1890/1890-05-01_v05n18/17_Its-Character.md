# Its Character.

THE *Arkansas Democrat* publishes a sermon delivered by Rev. Thos. M. C. Birmingham, in Argenta, Arkansas, in which the reverend gentleman takes up in course, and advocates, the different measures championed by the National Reform Association. When he reached the Sunday question, he acknowledged unblushingly his active furtherance of the iniquitous measure which the Legislature of Arkansas was asked to pass at its last session, and with which it might have tarnished its statute books, had not the earnest opposition of the National Religious Liberty Association led the members of the House to realize the character of the legislation which was being asked of them.

Mr. Birmingham says: "The Arkansas Conference requested that I present a remonstrance to the Legislature of this State, on the need and benefit of Sabbath laws, and the present lack of efficient ones on our statute books, and I did so, at its last session. . . . However, while urging this, also pleading with the General Assembly, the greater reason of man's moral need of the day, and that his hope of immortality might be clear and luminous, I doubt if there were over a dozen members of the lower house of the last Legislature that had anything like clear views of the importance of the Sabbath, to the welfare of society. And when a very weak Sabbath bill passed the Senate (and it was so weak that it was hardly worth having) it was killed in the House. And this was done by men who were there, not as individuals but as representatives of every voter and elector in this commonwealth."

While an unqualified Sunday law appeared in the statutes of Arkansas, the State made itself an unenviable notoriety for its legalized crimes of religious persecution, directed against a class of people who kept the seventh day, and who were, as their persecutors have themselves declared, good citizens.

An exemption clause was inserted in the law, for the benefit of this class; but at the last session of the Legislature a determined attempt was made to strike it out, and re-establish the wholesale persecution for conscience sake, which had been previously enacted. Those who presented the measure did not hesitate to avow that the purpose of the bill was to cause the seventh-day keepers of a certain district, to yield their conscientious convictions, or leave the State.

This is the character of the legislation on which the Arkansas Methodist Episcopal Conference requested one of its ministers to advocate before the Legislature of its State. [143-144]
