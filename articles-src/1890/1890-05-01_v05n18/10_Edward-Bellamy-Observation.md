EDWARD BELLAMY, the author of "Looking Backward," and "The Fool's Paradise," sagely observes that the hardest workers and the chiefest producers are the poorest paid and worst treated. And of the truth of this we seem to find proof in the fact that Mr. Bellamy has made a pile of money and won heaps of admiration out of that book of his, while the compositors who set up the type, the men who run the presses, the operatives who made the paper, and others haven't made more than ordinary wages out of it, and are not quite so well treated as Mr. Bellamy is by the admirers of that kind of rubbish.—*Chicago Times. *[142]
