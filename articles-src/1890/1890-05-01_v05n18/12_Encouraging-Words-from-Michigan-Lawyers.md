# Encouraging Words from Michigan Lawyers.

OVER seventy letters have been received, the past week, from members of the legal profession, resident in the State of Michigan, indorsing the work of the Religious Liberty Association, and expressing sympathy with the position taken by the AMERICAN SENTINEL, in reference to legislation upon religious questions. A few extracts are quoted below:—

> That a sentiment has been, and is, growing—slowly yet quite well rooted—in our free America, to connect Church and State in minor matters, cannot longer be denied. This is evidenced by certain acts of the Legislatures of different States, certain bills in the National Congress, and recent decisions of the Judiciary of some States. I am heartily in sympathy with the mission of the National Religious Liberty Association, and the SENTINEL. We know of no other America to which we may migrate, to escape this evil, and we have only to submit, or meet it and if possible, crush it while in embryo.

I have noted the tendency of our Government toward paternalism, centralization, and the union of Church and State, during the past few years. . . . Every right minded man will welcome the AMERICAN SENTINEL, as a champion of the rights of free men. . . . And it seems to me that lawyers, generally, will be found in line with the principles it advocates.

> I most earnestly commend the mission which you and your paper have undertaken and very ably advocate, and I most unqualifiedly approve of the principles of religious liberty which you defend, and without which civil liberty cannot long remain. To me, it seems marvelous, that in this enlightened country which has for a century boasted of its civil and religious freedom as basic principles of its Government, there should seem to be any occasion to defend them, or to endeavor to convince any, of the dangers which must result from any interference by the Government, with religious matter—except to protect every citizen in the full enjoyment of his opinions relating thereto, and in all such religious observances as any may see fit to adopt, which do not interfere with the like enjoyment by others of their rights. But strange, as it seems to those who stand free from the bigotry and superstition of the past ages, there does appear to be a necessity that such papers as the SENTINEL shall exist, and that active and energetic measures should be adopted to counteract the efforts to place our country under the rule of ecclesiasticism, which all history has proven to be the most cruel and relentless despotism the world has ever known.

Yours of March 21 received this morning, and in reply will say; that I fully believe in the principles of your Association, and believe absolutely in the sentiment, as expressed in the SENTINEL, against any union whatever of Church and State. Every phase of such a condition of things, will always meet my most decided disapproval.

I do not approve of Senator Blair’s bill, nor his views; but I never knew of any nation suffering from too much religion—if genuine; nor did I ever read of any people too well educated, or too highly cultivated. But these are matters which do not come by legislation

I have not only received, but read with much interest, the matter sent me. It meets my views exactly. No meddling with the Constitution. It is as it should be, as the fathers left it; and to him or them who would change it to favor any sect or society, I say “hands off!” I like the tone of the SENTINEL. It is engaged in a good work.

We can assure you, that the members of this firm are each fully in accord with the sentiments of the SENTINEL, SO far as its advocacy of perfect religious liberty and absolute independence of Church and State is concerned.

I like the tone and sentiments of the SENTINEL and Association, inasmuch as I am for religious liberty pure and simple as guaranteed by the Constitution.—

I heartily indorse the principles and mission of the SENTINEL, having been a subscriber for the same for some time past. ... I wish there was a branch of the Religious Liberty Association organized in every city, village, and hamlet, in the United States, and that the SENTINEL could be read by every family in the land. Hoping you will succeed in this good work, I remain, Yours for the Right.

As was to be expected, Senator Blair disapproves the Wisconsin decision.

[135-136]

IT is a standing reproach to the sober sense of the American people that there have been found amongst them 330,000 persons who would buy Edward Bellamy’s nonsensical book “Looking Backward.”

Says the *Union Signal:* “Time was when a large proportion of the Christian World would have looked upon any marked observance of Lent as a relic of Popery, and while we gazed with interest upon Easter ceremonies, we nevertheless regarded them as spectacular and unnecessary.” Yes, that is so. It would be a good thing if that time would come again and continue indefinitely.

Miss WILLARD announces that “there is to be a party that will combine the farmer and the wage earner, that will make its force felt in the next campaign, and the Prohibition Party will form the nucleus. When that time comes, we will side with it and will take the consequences.” If she means indeed “the consequences,” then if that party wins, we pity her. It would be worse consequences than we should ever wish to see befall a human being.

OF the Nationalistic theories set forth by Edward Bellamy the *Voice* says: “The millennium lies somewhere in the direction this movement is heading.” As to whereabouts in this direction the millennium probably lies, the *Voice* allows that “it may be ten thousand years distant.” That is a very safe estimate. It is certainly not any nearer than that, and how much further off it is does not materially concern either the present or the rising generation.

THE Presbyterian Synod of New York has, for several years, been working in behalf of religion in the public schools. A committee is appointed each year to have charge of the matter. This year again this committee on religion and public education has been appointed to confer with other denominations and seek their co-operation in the effort to introduce in the public schools some positive religious teaching as an essential part of the curriculum. Amongst the members appointed to confer with the several conferences of the Methodist Episcopal Church, we find the name of Dr. Howard Crosby. That is a very appropriate appointment. We hope all the others are of the same kind, because Dr. Crosby is openly and decidedly opposed to any religious instruction whatever in the public schools. We are not acquainted with the position of any of the other persons named, but we hope they are all of the same mould of thought and opinion on this subject as is Dr. Crosby.

IF the Sunday newspaper is such an outrageously wicked, such an all-polluting thing, and if it is such a heinous sin to read it, it is a query with us how in the world all the Sunday-law preachers know so much about it? Although they warn everybody against it under penalty of the imputation of a great sin, yet they themselves seem to know all about it; they can tell exactly how many columns of gossip, how much scandal, etc., different editions of the Sunday paper contain. How can these things be?

A STATEMENT that is quite often made, and which seems to be considered of much weight, by the workers for religious legislation is that “your rights end where mine begin.” This statement has not a particle of truth in it. It is simply another form of expressing their arrogant assumption of all rights. For if your rights end where mine begin, then it is for me to decide where mine do begin, and wherever that may be, there your rights must end. Don’t you see? In other words, all the rights that you have are just such as I choose to allow. The truth of the matter is that rights are perfectly equal. Your rights begin where mine begin; and end only where mine end.

THAT Wisconsin decision has caused wide-spread discussion, but none too wide. It is interesting to see the course that the discussion takes. The great majority of the secular papers indorse it. In fact, we have found but one that does not indorse it, and that is the *Inter-Ocean. *On the other hand, the religious papers and preachers, especially the Methodist, strongly disapprove. The New York *Independent* unqualifiedly indorses it. The *Christian Advocate* is *the* representative journal of all Methodism in the United States. It decidedly disapproves of the decision. It says:—

> It seems very odd that the Bible should be gravely pronounced a sectarian book by the chief tribunal of one of the States of this eminently Christian country and so does the argument by which the court sustains that pronouncement.

This position of the Protestant preachers and religious papers only goes further to show what the wide-spread demand for religious legislation had already made manifest, that in what passes for Protestantism, there is no disposition to recognize any such principle as equality of rights before the law. And just as surely as that Protestantism should ever secure control of the civil power, it would be as cruel and unrelenting as ever a religious despotism was. That which professes to-day to be representative Protestantism has forgotten both what Protestantism is and what Christianity is.

THE *Union Signal* of April 3, announces Senator Blair’s re-introduction of his Educational bill, and says:—

> Now let every white ribboner bestir herself writing letters on behalf of our local unions to the Senators of the respective States, urging the adoption of this bill, and let us set at work, and in this difficult emergency, having done all, stand. Mrs. Mary H. Hunt is in Washington to foward the new movement, and will wisely direct our forces as heretofore. Mrs. Bittenbender will also work unceasingly for the measure.

Yes, Senator Blair’s theory of government and the purposes of his legislation are directly in the line of things of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union. As we have shown in the SENTINEL, the theory of government contemplated in that legislation is directly the reverse of that of the United States Government, and it is directly opposed to Christian principles, and, in short, aims at the subversion of Christianity itself.

THERE is opposition also in Canada against the Dominion Sunday Law that is proposed for enactment. A correspondent of the Moncton *Times* says:—

> A reaction has set in against Charlton’s Sabbath observance bill and petitions against its passage headed, “A Plea for Religious Liberty,” and praying the Commons not to pass any bill in regard to the observance of Sabbath or any other religious or ecclesiastical institution, or to favor the adoption of any legislation to conflict with the rights of conscience, were presented to-day from Westmoreland, Scots’ Bay, Tiverton, Digby, French Village, Halifax, Dartmouth, Indian Harbor, Moncton and Truro.

That is right. Let the good work go on. Call the attention of legislators to the essential evil that belongs with such legislation. Our friends in Canada have not the constitutional basis for their opposition that we have in this country, but they have all the basis of inalienable civil and religious rights that we have in this country, or that people have anywhere else, and that is the strongest basis that any argument can have. This proposed legislation gives to the friends of liberty of conscience an excellent opportunity to make known to the people of Canada what are the sound principles of Christianity upon the separation between religion and the State. We hope they will employ the opportunity for all that it is worth. [137]
