# A National Reformer's Plea for Saloon- Keepers.

A NOTABLE effort to secure the passage of an ordinance closing saloons on Sunday has been defeated by our City Council. The Judiciary Committee have reported against its passage, with but one dissenting voice. The measure was the pet scheme of Rev. N. R. Johnston, the Pacific Coast apostle of National Reform, and it was supported by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and several ministers, who have labored zealously to palm it off as a temperance measure. But the more they talked about it, the more it became evident that it was designed to further the Sunday-sacredness dogma rather than temperance reform.

Mr. Camron, of the council, was very outspoken against the passage of all such ordinances, and his remarks called out Mr. Johnston, who took the councilman to task through the columns of the *Morning Times.* Replying to the remark, "The liquor men have a right to do business, and we have given it to them," Mr. Johnston says:—

> But who gave the saloonists the right to sell strong drink to common drinkers? The divine Lawgiver from whom alone rights are derived, did not. He is a kind, as well as a just Ruler.

Conceding the truth of this assertion, it is equally true that the divine Lawgiver never gave Mr. Johnston or his party the right to impose Sunday observance upon any of his fellow-citizens. It is also true that the divine Lawgiver never gave any man the right to change his law in respect to the Sabbath-day, but the Government recognizes the right of Sunday advocates to believe and act individually as they please in the matter. We do not hear Mr. Johnston censuring the Government for giving them the right to violate God's law in this respect. He knows very well that the divine law says "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God," and no Sunday adherent has ever dared to print it any other way; yet he declines to observe that day, and advocates the substitution of another day in its stead, and also the enforcement of that observance upon others. Should the city, or the State, or general Government undertake to abridge his civil right to ignore the divine law in this respect, would he admit the validity of his argument in the case under consideration? This inquisitorial principle of men assuming to be the executors of the divine law, is the principle which lies back of all religious domineering in civil affairs, from whatever source.

But the crowning argument for this attempted Sunday-sacredness boom, under the thin guise of temperance, is found in the patronizing plea for the saloonists *opportunity* to go to church, or to the picnic. In view of the success of the movement, he says:—

> The saloonist would have an opportunity to go to church, or to the picnic, or to rest at home, on our rest-day.

Poor fellows! Certainly nobody will ever again censure them for not going to church since one of their worst enemies is ready to plead that they have no opportunity. But how do those other merchants and owners of mechanical shops along the same street get to church? There is no law to compel them to close. However, that logic might be explained in some ingenious way were it not for that incongruous plea in behalf of "saloonists" for an opportunity to go to picnics. At other times the Sunday-law preachers have complained because picnics are allowed on that day at all. But worst of all seems to be their lack of opportunity to "rest at home on our rest-day," and a city ordinance is therefore necessary for their relief.

But why all this beating round the bush to get a start on a Sunday-law campaign? Everybody knows the argument is absurd. The truth is, a great effort is to be made this summer to secure the election of a State Legislature that will enact a Sunday law next winter. Mrs. Bateham is in the State already; Mr. Crafts is announced for a tour of the State in May; the Prohibition party has just held its State convention, and has inserted a Sunday-law plank (encased in a "civil" screen) in its platform, and every available agency is being prepared for a vigorous campaign.

We may expect all manner of "clashing voices" arguments on the part of the Sunday-law speakers and writers, and some people are curious to know how much of a figure will be cut in the campaign by the plea of Mr. Johnston for the saloonists' opportunity to go to picnics on that day.W. N. GLENN.
