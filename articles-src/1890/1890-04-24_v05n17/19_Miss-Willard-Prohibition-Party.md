Miss WILLARD announces that "there is to be a party that will combine the farmer and the wage earner, that will make its force felt in the next campaign, and the Prohibition Party will form the nucleus. When that time comes, we will side with it and will take the consequences." If she means indeed "the consequences," then if that party wins, we pity her. It would be worse consequences than we should ever wish to see befall a human being.
