Says the *Union Signal:* "Time was when a large proportion of the Christian World would have looked upon any marked observance of Lent as a relic of Popery, and while we gazed with interest upon Easter ceremonies, we nevertheless regarded them as spectacular and unnecessary." Yes, that is so. It would be a good thing if that time would come again and continue indefinitely.
