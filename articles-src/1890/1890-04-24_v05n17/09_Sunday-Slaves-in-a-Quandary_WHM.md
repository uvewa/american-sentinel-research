THE local Sunday bill for the District of Columbia now before Congress, and referred to the District Committe of the House, is entitled, "A bill to prevent persons from being forced to labor on Sunday." If this is a consistent title, then the different sections of Chapter 36, on Crimes and Offenses, in the Revised Statutes of the District of Columbia, should have been variously entitled:—

An act to prevent persons from being forced to commit manslaughter, or assault with intent to kill, etc.

An act to prevent persons from being forced to maliciously, willfully or fraudulently burn any dwelling house, etc.

An act to prevent persons from being forced to commit burglary, etc.

An act to prevent persons from being forced to feloniously steal, take and carry away any goods or chattels, or other personal property, etc.

This would indeed be a statutory acknowledgement of the power of secondary causes, such as we have not yet seen; unless it should be referred to the ancient theory that the "king can do no wrong," and his prime minister therefore should be punished; so, as in this country each voter is an individual sovereign, therefore their prime ministers should suffer for the crime which the sovereign people have been forced to commit.

This is a very fine course of antique reasoning, but, unfortunately for the consistency of the Sunday measure, the conclusion in the body of the bill is very different from the result which these premises would warrant. The provisions of the bill itself, fix a penalty of not more than one hundred dollars fine upon any person, or corporation, or employe of any person or corporation, who shall perform any secular labor or business on Sunday, as well as upon the one who shall cause them to perform such labor. Hence it follows, that the sovereign people are not only dethroned, but enslaved, and are to be fined one hundred dollars, because of their enslavement.

This inconsistency, no doubt, was simply an oversight on the part of Mr. Breckinridge. He did not notice that he was framing his bill in such a manner as to fine the wrong man. He, of course, intended that the idea of the prevention of compulsory labor should be followed throughout, and the bill to read like this:—

> "A bill to prevent persons from being forced to labor on Sunday.

> "Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That it shall be unlawful for any person, or corporation, or employe of any person or corporation in the District of Columbia, to force any person or corporation, or employe of any corporation, in the District of Columbia, to perform any secular labor or business on Sunday; nor shall it be lawful for any person or corporation, to receive pay for the compulsory services of their employes, rendered in violation of this act."
Whoever those persons are, who are being forced to work seven days in a week, in the District of Columbia, they must be looking with some interest, to learn if this be the true form of the measure which Mr. Breckinridge intended to present.W. H. Mc KEE.
