THE *Union Signal* of April 3, announces Senator Blair's re-introduction of his Educational bill, and says:—

> Now let every white ribboner bestir herself writing letters on behalf of our local unions to the Senators of the respective States, urging the adoption of this bill, and let us set at work, and in this difficult emergency, having done all, stand. Mrs. Mary H. Hunt is in Washington to foward the new movement, and will wisely direct our forces as heretofore. Mrs. Bittenbender will also work unceasingly for the measure.

Yes, Senator Blair's theory of government and the purposes of his legislation are directly in the line of things of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. As we have shown in the SENTINEL, the theory of government contemplated in that legislation is directly the reverse of that of the United States Government, and it is directly opposed to Christian principles, and, in short, aims at the subversion of Christianity itself.
