OF the Nationalistic theories set forth by Edward Bellamy the *Voice* says: "The millennium lies somewhere in the direction this movement is heading." As to whereabouts in this direction the millennium probably lies, the *Voice* allows that "it may be ten thousand years distant." That is a very safe estimate. It is certainly not any nearer than that, and how much further off it is does not materially concern either the present or the rising generation.
