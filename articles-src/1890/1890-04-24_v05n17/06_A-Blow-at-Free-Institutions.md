# A Blow at Free Institutions.

ANOTHER move has been made upon Congress to secure the passage of what is euphemistically styled the “Sunday- rest bill.” Petitions are being cooked up in many portions of the country with the same fatal facility that has characterized such deceptive devices recently in this city, and a number of them have already reached the capital, which purport to voice public sentiment. This is the most insidious and dangerous attempt yet made to entangle the Government with religion, and should meet the prompt condemnation of patriotic citizens, be they Christians or the reverse. The fathers of the republic knew very well what they were doing when they framed the Constitution. Their decision upon this matter was the result of the ripest wisdom, based not only upon the bitterest experience the world has ever known, but upon the express words of Christ—“Render, therefore, unto Cesar the things which are Cesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s.” They saw stretching out behind them a long line of uninterrupted precedents establishing incontestably the fact that the union of Church and State, or the interference of either with the other, was ruinous to both, and that the zealot or the hair-brained politician needed but the frailest foundation upon which to build a calamitous superstructure of interference, so they omitted all reference to religion.

The two things are in their nature distinct, and their separation should be rigidly maintained for the good of both. Civil government is instituted for man’s convenience on earth, while religion provides for his needs in another sphere of existence. The one is intended to facilitate man’s intercourse with his fellowmen, the other to teach him his relations to the Almighty. The advocates of this innovation say that the better Christian a man is the better citizen he will be. This proves nothing. On the same plea the Government should regulate a man’s food and his wearing apparel, his domestic relations and his business affairs, for all contribute to good or bad citizenship. So far as is known at present, the best government is that which insures the greatest freedom of action to the individual, consistent with the rights and comfort of all, and as the Government of the United States does that it is the best on the face of the earth—nay, it is the model to which the oppressed peoples of the world look with hope and hasten to adopt as the shackles are stricken from them. No single feature of it is so admirable or has been such a power for good as this rigid separation of Church and State, which gives to every citizen the absolute control of his own conscience and the right to worship God as he pleases, and on whatever day of the week he believes to be the proper one. Considered from a secular standpoint, the mingling of Church and State, of which the Sunday-rest bill would inevitably be the entering wedge, is objectionable—first, because it is an unwarrantable interference with the liberty of the citizen, and secondly, because in every country and in every age where the foundation has been laid the church has encroached upon its privileges until the State has been forced to take steps for its preservation.

From a religious point of view, the union of the two in any form is, if possible, still more objectionable. Religion exhibits to-day a more vigorous and healthy growth in the United States than in any other country on the civilized globe, obviously because here it is free as the air we breathe, untrammeled by statutes or the coercive and life-crushing power of civil authority. There is really no comparison between the religious vitality of our own people and that of the most advanced nation in Europe. So palpable is this that it has compelled acknowledgement from the highest ecclesiastical dignitaries, and the most progressive countries are imitating our example by severing as fast as possible the links which bind Church and State together. Competition, so far from being disastrous, has been a healthy stimulus to all sects and denominations, and has given that impetus to free and full discussion of religious subjects, without which nine-tenths of those who clung to the Church in the past did so in name only, without clear ideas of their duties to their Maker, or any sincere inclination to perform them. Nothing could be more detrimental to the cause of religion than the passage of the Sunday-rest bill. Many thousands of Christians are opposed to it on purely religious grounds, and millions of sincerely pious men oppose it because of the blow it aims at American institutions.—*Baltimore American. *[127-128]

THE *Colorado Graphic* remarks that “fortunately for the dignity, intelligence, and discretion of Denver’s Christian clerical force, only a minority has taken active part in the Sunday-legislation movement.”

THE report is being circulated to some extent that some of the judges on the Supreme Bench of Wisconsin are Roman Catholics, and hence the late decision on the question of the Bible in the schools. We have it upon good authority, and direct, that not one of the members of that court is a Roman Catholic. The decision would be just and right, however, even if every one of them were a Roman Catholic.

THE report of the Treasurer of the National Reform Association, at its recent annual meeting, shows that the receipts of the society for the past-year were $7,179.13. Of this amount $5,374.01 had been expended, mostly in salaries to District Secretaries. The work of the society is not however represented by this sum, for a good deal has been accomplished by special secretaries who work without remuneration. Secretary Weir reported that he had preached one hundred sermons on National Reform topics to audiences aggregating twenty-one thousand persons.

THE following paragraph, in a private letter from Baltimore, Maryland, is evidence of the rapid tendency toward strict formality in Sunday observance, and the readiness of municipal authorities to undertake its enforcement by city ordinances:—

> The ringing of milkmen’s bells, and street-car bells has not been stopped in the city of Baltimore, on Sunday, as yet. But there is a city ordinance pending (introduced at the last sitting of the city council) which does call for the bells on horses attached to street-cars, to be removed on Sunday. Also, that milkmen’s bells are not to be rung on Sunday. This ordinance has had its first reading, and been referred to a committee.

> The city Comptroller furnishes this information, and gives it as his opinion, that the ordinance will pass, in due time. He also informed me, that this was in accordance with the best wishes of the Protestant ministers and their congregations of the city of Baltimore. By request of the ministers of the city in the form of a petition to street-car managers, nearly all the street-car bells have been left off the horses on Sunday, voluntarily, but not by city ordinances, as yet.
It seems, at first thought, peculiarly inapt, that Baltimore, the earliest home of knightly aristocracy, should be the first, in this millennial dawn of the new era of municipal religion, to undertake the enforcement of a Puritan Sunday. That such should be the case, is food for thought.

Had the “wise man” lived in this age, he might have added to the four things which were too wonderful for him, a fifth,—“the way of a politician with the Church.”

REV. R. M. SOMERVILLE, of New York, an ardent National Reformer, likens Christ when excluded from civil government to a captain at sea, having a vessel and a crew, but being prohibited from entering any harbor. He does not explain wherein the likeness consists, but as a vessel in such a condition would be liable to be wrecked, Mr. Somerville must regard the Lord as in imminent danger of losing his craft (the Church) because civil governments deny him the aid of their puny strength. This is only to say that without the aid of the civil power, Christ’s mission must fail.

IN a speech in Congress a few days since, Representative Dorsey, of Nebraska, said that the only opposition to the admission of Idaho was on the part of Mormons, who objected to the provision in the Constitution disfranchising them. This is not strictly correct. The National Reformers also object to the admission of Idaho, but for a different reason, namely: because the Constitution under which the State is seeking admission forbids religious instruction in the schools. The hope was expressed in the Washington convention that Congress would not admit Idaho with such a constitutional provision.

THE *Weekly Witness,* a religious paper of this city, remarks that—

> As a meddler in politics the Church of Rome is always and everywhere an unmitigated curse; just as any Protestant church would be which should insist on being reckoned with, as a church, in all matters of administration, and especially in the dispensing of public moneys. We are very decidedly opposed to the religious teachings of the Church of Rome, but in so far as it limits its teaching and claims to matters of religion we are prepared to treat it with respect as an institution which has as good a right to exist as any Protestant Church. When it steps out of its proper sphere, however, to make money out of politics, then it is time for Protestants of all denominations and of all parties to unite in opposition to it. If any Protestant Church should take a similar position it should meet with the same condemnation. But no Protestant Church would dare to do so, or could obtain the support of its own members if it did. The Roman Catholic Church is different from all others in this country, except the Mormon Church, in that it is essentially a political institution; always has been so and always must be, because it claims absolute and universal sovereignty as the authorized representative of Christ the true King and Ruler of the world.

This criticism is certainly just, as applied to the Romish Church. Any political church is a curse whether it be Rome everywhere or the Mormon Church in Utah. And yet this is just the position the National Reformers and their allies are determined that the Protestant Church as a whole shall assume. They demand that the several Protestant bodies shall make common cause and insist on being reckoned with as churches in all matters of administration. If the Protestant churches shall do this, as they seem inclined to do, will they not then be just as much of a curse as the Papal Church, and for the very same reason? The question admits of but one answer. Does it not follow that the real friends of Protestantism are those who desire that the Protestant churches shall as churches have nothing to do with politics?

THE true spirit of National Reform, though carefully concealed in the Washington Convention by most of the speakers, cropped out in President Sylvester S. Scovel’s address on the “Limitations of Liberty.” Referring to our foreign population he said that if necessary they should “be educated with the bludgeon, and if the offense was repeated, with the blunderbuss.” It was formerly considered necessary to kill people in order to save them, but that method of preaching the gospel has not been much in vogue for some time. It is evident however that the National Reformers hope to be able to revive it.

*The Associated Press of Reforms* is the name of a new quarterly publication which the “Reform Syndicate” of this city has just launched upon the treacherous sea of polemic journalism. The whilom field secretary of the American Sabbath Union is the manager of the syndicate, and as the new paper is a “special publication for publishers and editors of periodicals,” and as the matter which it contains is secured by copyright, and as the copyright articles are to be released for re-publication for twelve dollars per year, or furnished in plates at very reasonable rates, it seems that the principle object of the syndicate is to get their “reform” matter into country papers which are printed largely from plates. Mr. Crafts is, it must be admitted, fertile in expedients. [129]
