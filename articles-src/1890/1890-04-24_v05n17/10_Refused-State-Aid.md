REV. J. G. LEMEN is the founder and manager of an orphanage in Council Bluffs, Iowa, known as the Christian Home. Early in March Hon. J. K. McGavren, member of the Iowa Legislature from Harrison County, introduced a bill appropriating for this Home the sum of $5,000. This action was taken without consulting Mr. Lemen, who as soon as he was fully informed in regard to the bill wrote to its author as follows:—

> HON. J. K. MCGAVREN,—

> *Dear Sir:* Yours of the 10th at hand. I heartily thank you, in the name of Christ and his helpless little ones, for what you did, considering the heart- motive that prompted you in the act.
> But, the more I have prayed and thought over the matter, the more I am convinced that it is not a matter that I desire pushed, for the following reasons:—
> 1. This is a work of faith. We desire to look to God and to him alone.
> 2. If we accept this aid, we help to set a precedent for all sorts of private and sectarian charities making a raid on the public treasury. This I believe to be a bad precedent. If then, so believing, I lend my sanction to this, I do evil that good may come, which is wrong.
> I thank you again for the kindness of heart that prompted you to introduce the bill in question, and I will always remember you with a grateful heart. I hope to meet you at the Home, and to ever have [133] your earnest co-operation. But here and now, allow me to declare that I am opposed to this measure and all like measures. I do not believe that the State should aid any institutions other than regular State institutions, which are under the supervision and full control of the State. Any other course is a virtual union of Church and State; it is virtually taxing those who are opposed to Christianity, or given forms of it to support institutions under the control of those advocating and teaching that to which the tax-payers, or a portion of them, are conscientiously opposed. This is contrary to the spirit of our free institutions.
> With kind regards of all at the Home, I am yours in Christ.
This letter must commend itself to every unprejudiced person as being thoroughly sensible and Christian. This gentleman is engaged in a Christian work which he is doing in a Christian way and which he desires to see supported by Christian benevolence.

Mr. Lemen also publishes a paper for the orphanage called the *Christian Home, *and in an article in that paper of March 20, he says:—

> We had every reason to believe that we could secure the $5,000 in question. . . . We frankly admit, therefore, that when we first heard of the matter, we were greatly elated, as it was natural that we should be. But as soon as we had time to calmly consider the matter, taking it to the Lord in prayer, we felt impressed by the Spirit that it would be a very wicked thing for us to accept of the proffered aid, for the accepting of State aid by institutions of the character of the Home is a virtual union of Church and State, as all must admit who calmly consider the matter. The Home, of course, does not pretend to be a church; but, in its aims and work, it is so akin to the Church that, as far as the principle involved in this matter is concerned, no line of distinction can be drawn. Shall we, then, dear Christian fellow-laborers, simply for the sake of Mammon, doubting God our Father, help to encourage the union of Church and State? Had we, dear fellow-workers, accepted this aid, our voice would have been silenced; and we could never, henceforth, have uttered a protest against the growing tendency of State Legislatures granting away the people's money by hundreds of thousands to all sorts of private and sectarian charities that chance to have influence enough to secure appropriations, thus doing indirectly what they dare not do directly—legislating in favor of the union of Church and State. In short, by accepting this aid we would have permitted Satan to have bought us with a price, so that we could never henceforth, with any show of consistency, have uttered a word against the union of Church and State.

All honor, say we to one who thus stands for Christian principle! We feel assured that the Council Bluffs, Iowa, Christian Home is in good hands, and that the orphans who find a refuge there will be instructed in a manner that will tend to make them substantial Christian men and women that will not need the aid of the State or of the civil law to enable them to live out their Christian convictions. There is power in a religion that is not afraid to stand alone, and that will boldly say, Our trust is in God. The ministers of the National Reform Association and the American Sabbath Union should profit by the example of Mr. Lemen and learn to put their trust in God rather than in the State.
