THE newspapers that attack the Supreme Court of Wisconsin for its decision that the reading of the Bible in the public schools of that State is in violation of the Constitution, are more enthusiastic than wise. The matter is one of law purely. The judges, as we are advised, are Christian men; and while no doubt they would like to see the Bible read in all the public schools of the State, that is no reason why they should put the Constitution aside. Besides, the question relates to a particular version which the Catholics do not accept.

The starting point of the whole matter is the constantly recurring one of sectarianism in the public schools, in which religion cannot be introduced free from sectarianism. The Wisconsin court is undoubtedly right in its position, some well meaning newspapers to the contrary notwithstanding. Certain it is that the reading in the public schools of the Douay, or Roman Catholic, version of the Bible would be denounced by the Protestant world as secular instruction prohibited by the Constitution. The reading of the King James version is no less so. Let us have peace.—*Christian at Work.*
