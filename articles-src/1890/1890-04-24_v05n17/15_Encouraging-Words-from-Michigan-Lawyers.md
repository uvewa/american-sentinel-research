OVER seventy letters have been received, the past week, from members of the legal profession, resident in the State of Michigan, indorsing the work of the Religious Liberty Association, and expressing sympathy with the position taken by the AMERICAN SENTINEL, in reference to legislation upon religious questions. A few extracts are quoted below:—

> That a sentiment has been, and is, growing—slowly yet quite well rooted—in our free America, to connect Church and State in minor matters, cannot longer be denied. This is evidenced by certain acts of the Legislatures of different States, certain bills in the National Congress, and recent decisions of the Judiciary of some States. I am heartily in sympathy with the mission of the National Religious Liberty Association, and the SENTINEL. We know of no other America to which we may migrate, to escape this evil, and we have only to submit, or meet it and if possible, crush it while in embryo.

I have noted the tendency of our Government toward paternalism, centralization, and the union of Church and State, during the past few years. . . . Every right minded man will welcome the AMERICAN SENTINEL, as a champion of the rights of free men. . . . And it seems to me that lawyers, generally, will be found in line with the principles it advocates.

> I most earnestly commend the mission which you and your paper have undertaken and very ably advocate, and I most unqualifiedly approve of the principles of religious liberty which you defend, and without which civil liberty cannot long remain. To me, it seems marvelous, that in this enlightened country which has for a century boasted of its civil and religious freedom as basic principles of its Government, there should seem to be any occasion to defend them, or to endeavor to convince any, of the dangers which must result from any interference by the Government, with religious matter—except to protect every citizen in the full enjoyment of his opinions relating thereto, and in all such religious observances as any may see fit to adopt, which do not interfere with the like enjoyment by others of their rights. But strange, as it seems to those who stand free from the bigotry and superstition of the past ages, there does appear to be a necessity that such papers as the SENTINEL shall exist, and that active and energetic measures should be adopted to counteract the efforts to place our country under the rule of ecclesiasticism, which all history has proven to be the most cruel and relentless despotism the world has ever known.

Yours of March 21 received this morning, and in reply will say; that I fully believe in the principles of your Association, and believe absolutely in the sentiment, as expressed in the SENTINEL, against any union whatever of Church and State. Every phase of such a condition of things, will always meet my most decided disapproval.

I do not approve of Senator Blair's bill, nor his views; but I never knew of any nation suffering from too much religion—if genuine; nor did I ever read of any people too well educated, or too highly cultivated. But these are matters which do not come by legislation

I have not only received, but read with much interest, the matter sent me. It meets my views exactly. No meddling with the Constitution. It is as it should be, as the fathers left it; and to him or them who would change it to favor any sect or society, I say "hands off!" I like the tone of the SENTINEL. It is engaged in a good work.

We can assure you, that the members of this firm are each fully in accord with the sentiments of the SENTINEL, SO far as its advocacy of perfect religious liberty and absolute independence of Church and State is concerned.

I like the tone and sentiments of the SENTINEL and Association, inasmuch as I am for religious liberty pure and simple as guaranteed by the Constitution.—

I heartily indorse the principles and mission of the SENTINEL, having been a subscriber for the same for some time past. ... I wish there was a branch of the Religious Liberty Association organized in every city, village, and hamlet, in the United States, and that the SENTINEL could be read by every family in the land. Hoping you will succeed in this good work, I remain, Yours for the Right.
