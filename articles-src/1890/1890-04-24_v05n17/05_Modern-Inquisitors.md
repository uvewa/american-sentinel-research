AND now comes the report of the trial and conviction of an American citizen in the State of Tennessee for the monstrous crime of religious convictions. Mr. R. M. King, a reputable citizen of Obion County in that State, but with the misfortune of belonging to the small sect of Seventhday Adventists, having observed Saturday as his Sabbath, was recently seized and indicted on the charge of plowing on the next day, "without regard" to the orthodox Sabbath. All the witnesses in the case testified to the good character of the accused as a law-abiding citizen. They all confessed on cross-examination that they were not disturbed in any way, except that their "moral and religious feelings" were shocked. Their examination showed that two of them—Christian (?) gentlemen—were members of an organization pledged to prosecute every violation of Sabbath laws. The defendant's counsel offered to prove that men in the same neighborhood—but not holding unorthodox religious views—had cut wheat, rafted logs and performed other work on Sunday for which they had not been legally disturbed; but the court would not permit him to submit his proof. The State's attorney made an inflammatory speech against the crime of the defendant. The judge overruled a motion for a new trial, and Mr. King was heavily fined for his criminal audacity in entertaining the religious belief that the " Christian Sabbath" was a secular day, on which he could conscientiously perform secular duties.

Such are the first fruits of the heralded "Sabbath laws" in the land of alleged religious liberty! So much for the adoption of the methods of the mediaeval Inquisition by nineteenth century republican governments!

These are the laws and these are the methods, Californians, that *we* are demanded by religious fanaticism to make for the government of the citizens of this free State! These Christian gentlemen of Tennessee are not persecutors. Oh, no! They are only Christians, working for the temporal good of their fellow men! It were a shame to call them inquisitors! Religious men have never been known to persecute. They only "uphold the laws!" *—The Dial, Oakland, California.*
