FOR some time an organization known as the Chicago Sunday Closing Association has been in existence in Chicago. This has been augmented, or in part supplanted by the Sunday-rest League.

This league states that its object "shall be to co-operate with the Chicago Sunday Closing Association in securing, by all proper means, freedom from unnecessary Sunday labor, and especially the closing of factories, shops, stores and saloons on Sunday." They employ a secretary who spends all his time in the city in the interests of the league, his work being largely among the foreign element in Chicago.

Article three of their constitution states that the league shall be composed of the representatives of the whole population, independent of sectarian control or party dictation." The *Chicago News* has indorsed the league quite fully and seems to be its special organ of communication.

The above will give some idea of the [132] organization. It will be seen at once that it is formed on a basis to gather in all who can be led to believe in Sunday legislation. And their plan, of course, is to get the best class of citizens worked into it.

Their *intentions* may be good, but their *object is too narrow,* and will, in the end, lead to bad results. To simply close saloons on Sunday would give a sanction to the accursed traffic in rum by virtually saying to men, "If you only keep from the saloon on Sunday, it is all right to go there on other days." And the closing of factories, shops, stores, etc., on Sunday, has more to it for Chicago than one might, at first glance, see. Our large cities are considered to be the rendezvous for anarchists, and other discontented persons that are ever watching for an opportunity to do mischief. Chicago surely has its share of this element. These persons have no regard at all for Sunday as a day of sacred rest. And in fact the *News,* in reporting a speech recently delivered in Chicago stated that the *anarchists are atheists almost to a man.* It is also true of a great majority of the wage earners, that they are skeptical in regard to the Bible and also the claims of Sunday sanctity. And if these persons should all be turned loose on Sunday without any reverence for the day they would plunge into debauchery that would hurt them worse physically, and far worse morally, than for them to engage in honest toil. And the simple act of closing the saloons on Sunday would not stop them from having a supply of strong drink. For a man with any sense at all will be sharp enough to get his liquor the day before, when he knows the saloons are going to be closed on Sunday.

Then the problem before us is like this: We see hundreds of men toiling every day in the week, and we know from actual contact with them that the great majority of them have no convictions of the sacredness of any day. Then if we compel them by law to rest, we simply compel them to be idle and they are sure to be led into some kind of dissipation. For if a man takes no pleasure in the *religious* phase of the day, he will seek *some means of enjoyment* and that is sure to be in the line of sensual gratification and will always injure him more than it would to work. But, say the Sunday-law advocates, if we would turn them loose on Sundays, so they would not have to work, would they not attend church and thus become better? It might be well to reply by asking, Why do they not attend church now on the Sundays that they are idle? But in place of going to church, some of them meet for anarchist Sunday-school, where, in the place of the precepts of Christ being taught, the children are fired with the doctrines of anarchists. Then the more this class of people are compelled to be idle on Sunday the worse it is for all concerned. Would it not, then, be a wise plan to spend the labor that is being used to secure Sunday laws, in the line of *inculcating some principles* into this class which will lead them to love that which is right and good rather than to force them to be idle when they will use their idle time only for that which is bad? The outcome of it would be, if a strict Sunday law should be enforced, that the class they are trying to help would only be rendered more free to do evil, and then the National Reformers would come to the rescue and ask for another law to compel them to go to church where they could get at them to teach them National Reform morality.

This idea of Sunday closing and Sunday legislation seems to be striking all parts of the country as the great panacea for all our social ills, and the work of the AMERICAN SENTINEL is much needed to expose the danger of such would-be philanthropy.A. O. TAIT.
