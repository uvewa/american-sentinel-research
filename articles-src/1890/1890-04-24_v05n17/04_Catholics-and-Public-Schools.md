# Catholics and Public Schools.

HUMAN history establishes the fact that the civil Government, armed with force, cannot be entrusted with the culture of conscience. Any attempt on the part of the State to coerce the religious convictions of men has ended disastrously, both to the State and to religion. Because of the growing recognition of this fact the divorce of Church and State is becoming more nearly universal. America first embodied this principle in a political Constitution, and it has more and more found expression in our laws and institutions. Any movement, then, that would make an alliance between Church and State is repugnant.

If we define education in its broadest sense, the respective functions of the Church and State in connection with it at once becomes clear. Education is the development and cultivation of the physical, intellectual, and religious faculties of man. The State must see to the first two, the Church to the last. Their spheres are distinct.

The effort of the State, then, is for the sake of civil unity, to perfect the State on the basis of civil rights and science, treating all religious forms and faiths with strict impartiality. This at once rolls the whole responsibility of religious culture back upon the churches and the family, precisely where it justly belongs. Religion has been, and should be, entirely disregarded in our public schools. The State cannot attempt religious training. The Church must do that, and she must do it alone.

When the Catholic prelates ask a share *pro rata* of the school fund, they are asking the State to raise money by taxation for their parochial schools, that is, for the religious education of the young. But this is a thing the State cannot do without surrendering the well-established basal principle of the entire separation of Church and State. And if this principle be sur- rendered, and an alliance formed between the Church and State at this point, there is no telling where the end may be of State appropriations to religious objects, or how soon the whole foundation of our form of government would be weakened or destroyed. [126] The true safety of the State resides in adhering to the principle of separation, and therein also lies the true prosperity of religion.

But, as a matter of policy, the State must not yield an iota in the direction desired by our Catholic friends. For if Catholics may have their share of public money for religious uses, why not the Episcopalians? Why not the Baptists? Why not each of the two hundred different sects and factions? Thus the whole school fund might be frittered away. And then what would become of the infidels, the atheists, the non-church-goers? In short, what would be left of our free-school system? Instead of yielding a single step already gained toward the absolute separation of Church and State, it would be infinitely better for both civil government and religion to advance a step onward and tax all church properties.

In the plea made by our Catholic friends then that it is “unfair” and “unjust” that they should be taxed to support the public schools, while they tax themselves to maintain their parochial schools, the fallacy is apparent. The parochial schools are for religious purposes. That settles the whole question, for the State has nothing to do with religion, except to protect every one in the free exercise thereof. If the Catholic Church feels that she cannot preserve her youth in the faith, except by seven days’ teaching in the week, she is perfectly free thus to teach. No one can criticise her action in the matter. But she cannot justly invoke the aid of the State to help her. When the State taxes people for the support of religion then the Catholic Church may claim her full share. When the State employs religious teachers in her penal institutions then the Catholics in them are justly entitled to ministers of their own faith. They ought not, in justice, to be compelled to attend Protestant services. But when the State does not attempt religious education it would be gross injustice for her to discriminate in favor of Catholic schools, or of those of any other religious body. Every objectionable text book or teacher in the schools should be removed, and the schools put upon an absolutely unsectarian basis. Thus when the State treats all alike there can be no just cry of a lack of fairness toward any.—*Rev. W. W. Boyd *(*Baptist*),* Newark, N. J.*
