# The Washington National Reform Convention.

APRIL 1 to 3, there was held in Lincoln Music Hall, in Washington City, a session of the National Reform Association, and in connection with it a “National Conference on the Christian Principles of Civil Government.” This meeting was called for the purpose of creating a sentiment in Washington which it was hoped might influence legislation in the direction of so-called National Reform. The plans laid for the Convention were broad, and neither labor nor money was spared to make it a success. Fifteen thousand personal invitations to attend the meeting were issued, seven thousand being to residents of the city; and an appeal was published in the *Christian Statesman* asking the various churches, Sunday schools, and Christian Endeavor Societies throughout the country to send delegates, and a large attendance was expected. But much to the chagrin of the managers their expectations were not realized. Few delegates came, and the attendance throughout was small, the largest evening audience falling below four hundred, while the number at the forenoon and afternoon meetings was generally as low as forty; and never, I feel sure, reached one hundred.

At the first meeting nearly four hundred seats were reserved for delegates, and ushers were in attendance to see that they were not occupied by mere visitors. But there was no danger of this, for not to exceed forty persons were present, including four reporters and the officers of the Association. The result was that after waiting thirty minutes for the expected delegates the chairman invited all present to occupy the front seats. It was much the same the first evening. Visitors were again told that the same seats were reserved for delegates, but as the entire audience would have filled but little more than half the reserved seats, the effort to seat four hundred imaginary delegates was abandoned, and nothing more was said about any seats being reserved.

The disappointment of the managers at the meager attendance was plainly manifest, and in making an appeal for money to aid in paying the rent of the large hall secured, Dr. McAllister took occasion to explain that it. is exceedingly difficult to get people out to such meetings in Washington, and that in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia they had no difficulty in filling large halls with interested audiences. In private conversation Rev. M. A. Gault told the writer that the meeting had not been properly advertised, and when reminded that seven thousand invitations had been issued in the city alone, he said, “Yes, but the ministers did not announce it from their pulpits.” It is true that the ministers of the city took no part in the convention; and so far as I was able to learn only one of them was present, and he at only one meeting.

The usual line of argument was followed in the various papers read, and in the speeches made. The National Reformers have, however, learned wisdom from experience, and in this meeting they carefully avoided utterances which could be easily turned against them. Nothing was said about the effect the proposed amendment would have upon those who should refuse to recognize Christ as king, or bow to the National Reform interpretation of the law of God. No hint of banishment or disfranchisement for any class was given, as in past meetings, and moderation, quiet assurance, and dignity ruled throughout.

As before stated there was a “National Conference on the Christian Principles of Civil Government” held in connection with the session of the National Reform Association. This it seemed was for the two-fold object of calling in many who have not hitherto been identified with the Association, and of avoiding responsibility for the utterances of those who had been invited to deliver addresses. Indeed it was publicly stated that the Association would hold itself responsible only for such utterances as it saw fit to indorse by resolutions. But this separation of the Association and the Convention was a distinction without much difference. The same men managed both, and while there was a technical distinction there was practically *no difference.*

By far the most able addresses delivered were those of Rev. David McAllister, D.D., LL.D., and Mrs. Mary T. Lathrap, president of the Michigan Woman’s Christian Temperance Union. Dr. McAllister’s subject was, “The Secular Theory of the State.” His argument was fallacious, as all such arguments must of necessity be, but was well calculated to deceive those who [124] have never given the subject careful consideration. In only one particular did he overreach and present an argument which did not appear as a candid statement of his real convictions. This was an attempt to show that it is the secular theory rather than the National Reform theory which Would lead to a union of Church and State. To prove this he stated that “the secular papers are beginning to publish editorials demanding State aid for Sabbath schools.” This he insisted is but the legitimate result of denying the right of the State to give religious instruction. “It must be given,” he said, “for the preservation of the Nation; and since the State is, according to the secular theory, incompetent to give it, the Church must do it; and the State must give financial aid in order that it may be done.” This remarkable doctrine he gave his hearers to understand had been advocated by “secularists in secular papers.” The fact is that the only suggestion of the kind made was by the *Mail and Express* of New York, a paper which is in sympathy with everything looking in the direction of State interference in matters of religion. It is hard therefore to believe that in this thing the doctor was entirely honest either with himself or with his audience.

Mrs. Lathrap’s address was on the subject of “Christian Politics,” and was, from her standpoint, a scathing arraignment of the ministry and church membership of this country for want of Christian consistency in politics. Of course much that she said was excellent. Nobody denies that it is the duty of Christians to act conscientiously in every department of life; but the conclusion that Christians ought to insist that the Government, which belongs to the whole people, shall be moulded according to their ideas, and that certain things ought to be forbidden because they are not Christian, and certain other things required because they are Christian, is most mischievous. The writer believes that the traffic in intoxicating liquors to be used as beverages ought to be abolished; but not because it is morally wrong. It is morally wrong; but so are many other things which the civil law could not possibly reach, and with which nobody pretends to say that it should deal.

But it is a very easy thing to show that the liquor traffic is a menace to the peace and good order of the State, a constant danger to the citizen, the cause of most of the crime, that it fills our hospitals, poorhouses, and prisons, and that it indirectly levies tribute upon every tax-payer. These facts constitute a sufficient reason why the traffic should be prohibited; and they are the reasons which should govern the State in dealing with it. The State cannot undertake to prohibit and punish sin against God; it can of right take cognizance only of those acts which injure in person, property, or reputation those whom the State is bound to protect. This is the secular, the American theory of government, and to abandon it in the supposed interest of prohibition is a grievous mistake; it both hinders prohibition and threatens the religious liberty of every citizen. It is at this point that the women of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union go astray. The original purpose of that organization was to accomplish a Christian work by Christian means, to inculcate and encourage Christian temperance in the individual, to reform men and women by bringing them to Christ. But all this is now changed. While much was accomplished by Christian effort the rising tide of iniquity was not stayed, and so appeal has been made to the State to aid them, not in protecting the civil rights of citizens, not to prevent the husband and father from beggaring his wife and children, not to say that the saloon keeper shall not drug and rob his victim, not to say that men shall not ruin their fellows mentally and physically, to then cast them out as paupers or criminals to be supported by the State, not to protect life and property, but to prevent sin against the moral Ruler of the universe and to punish infractions of the law of God. It is thus that a most excellent Christian organization has become the annex of a political party to be manipulated by politicians for the accomplishment of party ends.

One feature of the Convention which should not be forgotten was its repudiation of the “civil Sabbath.” It was plainly declared in a resolution adopted that the Sabbath is not a civil but a religious institution, “and that the only proper basis for Sabbath legislation is the requirement of the divine law.” This declaration was emphasized by Dr. McAllister who said that to admit the civil basis for Sabbath laws was to admit the right of the State to fix a day independent of the law of God. “This,” said he, “we cannot do, for should the majority change they might change the day and we can observe only the first day, for we believe that it is the day that God requires us to keep.” This shows the Doctor’s utter disregard of the rights of conscience for those who differ from him in regard to the day required in the divine law. He demands of the seventhday keeper a surrender which he himself would not make were the State to choose a day other than Sunday and require its observance as a Sabbath, either “civil” or otherwise.

But this article is already too long, and further particulars concerning this meeting must be given at another time.
