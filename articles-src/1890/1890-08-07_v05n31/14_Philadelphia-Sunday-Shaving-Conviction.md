JUDGE PENNYPACKER, of Philadelphia, in the case of an appeal from the justice court, by William R. Waldman, a barber, convicted and fined for Sunday-shaving, has affirmed the conviction with a long opinion, in which he bases his affirmance upon a law of 1794, which provides a fine of four dollars "for the performance of any worldly employment on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday."
