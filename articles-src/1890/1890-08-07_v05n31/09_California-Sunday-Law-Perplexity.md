OUR friends who are exercised over the question of a Sunday law in California are in a great strait. They want a Sunday law, but they know that the people of California will not listen to any talk of religious legislation, and so their perplexity is to have the observance of Sunday enforced, and at the same time not let the people know that any religious legislation is going on. The *California Christian Advocate* says of the Sunday question: "It must be brought before the country as a civil measure, yet in such a way as not to secularize the day." Just so. We have all heard of the hunter who aimed at an animal so as to hit it if it was a deer, and to miss it if it was a calf. It is somewhat amusing to see our friends attempt this feat on the Sunday question. *—Signs of the Times.*
