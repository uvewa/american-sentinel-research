THE Central American correspondent of the New York *Sun,* says: "A movement is going on in all the five republics to close the shops and stores on Sundays. The markets and establishments where provisions are sold, will be opened during a certain part of the day." Although the Roman Catholic Church has been disestablished in Central America, yet, that is the form of religion quite universally espoused by the ruling classes; it is not likely to be difficult there, therefore, to obtain a formal observance of Sunday, enforced by law. To all who are experimentally acquainted, however, with Central American life and manners, such a "movement" presents itself as a grim sarcasm on the mock Christianity of this whole politico-legal hypocrisy.
