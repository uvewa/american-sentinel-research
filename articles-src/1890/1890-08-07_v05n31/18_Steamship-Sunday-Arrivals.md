Now that the national Government has taken charge of the landing of immigrants at New York, a writer in the *Mail and Express* is anxious that Congress should regulate the time of departure of steamships from foreign ports, so that they should not arrive and disembark their passengers here on Sunday. He thinks that if the national Government would notify steamship companies that after a given date immigrants would not be allowed to land on Sunday, there would be no trouble in obtaining compliance with such a regulation. "This when accomplished," he exclaims, "will be another point gained in favor of Sabbath observance." How numerous, and how wonderful are the ways in which it is sought to commit Congress to Sunday legislation!
