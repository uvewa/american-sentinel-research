REFERRING to the fact that the Government has been for years granting money to various denominations, for the education of certain Indians, the *World *asks: "What business has the United States to engage in religious proselyting of the Indians, when its policy towards them for a hundred years has been robbery and extinction?" Only one answer can be given, namely, that the United States has no business whatever to engage in any such work. If the Government had let the religious education of the Indians alone altogether, it is highly probable that they would have received more and better religious instruction than they have received. In that case, men and women having a genuine missionary spirit would have been sent among them, who would have labored from love of souls, instead of love for Uncle Sam's dollars. The greatest service that civil government can possibly do genuine Christianity, is to let religious instruction and religious questions severely alone.
