JUST now, Cardinal Gibbons is in bad odor with the *Mail and Express*, because he has said that he is in favor of opening museums and art galleries on Sunday, and that "apart from such religious exercises as each man's conscience may impose upon him, the day should be given up to such recreations as contribute to the physical, mental, and moral benefit and enjoyment of the people." "His position," says the *Mail and Express,* "is thoroughly consistent with the practices of his church. . . . In Romanist countries Sunday is usually a day of shows, and general dissipation. The priests are satisfied, if the people go to mass in the morning, and to confession occasionally, to have them desecrate the Sabbath in any way they please." The gentleman who presides over the destinies of the *Mail and Express, *would be satisfied with nothing less than the devoting of the whole of Sunday to religious exercise and spiritual meditation, saving that he would probably allow ample time, for those who could afford it, to enjoy the usual Sunday dinner.
