A CALIFORNIA paper, the *Citrograph, *notes the fact that Congress is being flooded with petitions for the closing of the Chicago World's Fair, on Sunday, and says: "Should this be done, hundreds of thousands of workers will be 'debarred from visiting the exposition. These Sunday-closing-petition signers can visit the exhibition any day they like; but the poor laborer, the workingman whose daily toil just suffices to keep his family going, must either be debarred from seeing the sights of the fair altogether or go on Sunday. We certainly hope Congress will totally ignore these petitions. To do otherwise will be to work a great hardship on the toilers of Chicago and vicinity."
