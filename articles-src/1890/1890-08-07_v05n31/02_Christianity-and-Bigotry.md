AN infidel paper says: "It is hard for a Christian to be tolerant; to be just. There is somewhat in Christianity that makes its adherents bigots." This is a mistake; those who are called Christians are often bigoted and intolerant, but the spirit of true Christianity is opposed to bigotry and intolerance. The fundamental principle of Christianity is, "All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them," and this leaves no room for bigotry and intolerance.

The gospel of Christ is a gospel of peace, not a gospel of force. Said the Saviour: "Behold, I send you forth as sheep among wolves; be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves." Acting under the divine commission to preach the gospel, the apostles went forth, not appealing to human governments to compel men to accept their message, but beseeching men "by the meekness and gentleness of Christ." Said the apostle: "Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God." The Christian who desires to go beyond these scriptures and compel men to believe, or to act as though they believed, should stop and ask if he has not himself lost the Spirit of Christ, if indeed he ever had it. "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance." Whoever has the Spirit of Christ will bring forth the fruits of the Spirit; and "if any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his," even though he may be called by his name. Said the Saviour: "Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven."
