THE *Christian Inquirer,* a Baptist paper of this city, says:—

> The Bible is the creed of Protestants. In this day when there is so much attention paid to confessions of faith, and so much said about a revision of creeds, the Church needs to swing back to the Bible as the supreme authority of doctrine and life, creed and conduct. Our battle will be shorter, sharper, more conclusive, and our victory surer and more glorious when we meet the hosts of infidelity, Romanism, and all sorts of falsehood and wicked ness, with the Bible only, in our hands. Our appeal must be to the Book! Every doctrine of men must be brought to the test of God's word. If it be of God it will stand; if not, it will perish, and ought to perish.

That is good; the Bible ought to be in fact, as it is in theory, the creed of Protestants. But how about forcing "the creed of Protestants" upon everybody by the power of the State? And if Protestants are indeed willing to bring everything to the test of the Bible, and if they believe that everything that is of God will stand, why do they seek to have some so-called Christian institutions bolstered up by civil laws?
