THE Methodists of Utah have adopted a strong resolution warning the people of the United States against Mormonism, and declaring that the radical cure for what they call the new and dangerous form of Mormon rebellion, is to be looked for largely in the pending legislation in Congress. Commenting upon this a secular paper remarks, that in this they "appear to have fallen into an error in the language, at least, of their resolution. The resolution condemns Mormonism. But the Government of the United States has no war to wage against Mormonism. Apart from polygamy, the rights of the Mormon Church in this country do not differ from those of any other church."
