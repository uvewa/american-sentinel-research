# Its Character.

THE *Arkansas Democrat* publishes a sermon delivered by Rev. Thos. M. C. Birmingham, in Argenta, Arkansas, in which the reverend gentleman takes up in course, and advocates, the different measures championed by the National Reform Association. When he reached the Sunday question, he acknowledged unblushingly his active furtherance of the iniquitous measure which the Legislature of Arkansas was asked to pass at its last session, and with which it might have tarnished its statute books, had not the earnest opposition of the National Religious Liberty Association led the members of the House to realize the character of the legislation which was being asked of them.

Mr. Birmingham says: “The Arkansas Conference requested that I present a remonstrance to the Legislature of this State, on the need and benefit of Sabbath laws, and the present lack of efficient ones on our statute books, and I did so, at its last session. . . . However, while urging this, also pleading with the General Assembly, the greater reason of man’s moral need of the day, and that his hope of immortality might be clear and luminous, I doubt if there were over a dozen members of the lower house of the last Legislature that had anything like clear views of the importance of the Sabbath, to the welfare of society. And when a very weak Sabbath bill passed the Senate (and it was so weak that it was hardly worth having) it was killed in the House. And this was done by men who were there, not as individuals but as representatives of every voter and elector in this commonwealth.”

While an unqualified Sunday law appeared in the statutes of Arkansas, the State made itself an unenviable notoriety for its legalized crimes of religious persecution, directed against a class of people who kept the seventh day, and who were, as their persecutors have themselves declared, good citizens.

An exemption clause was inserted in the law, for the benefit of this class; but at the last session of the Legislature a determined attempt was made to strike it out, and re-establish the wholesale persecution for conscience sake, which had been previously enacted. Those who presented the measure did not hesitate to avow that the purpose of the bill was to cause the seventh-day keepers of a certain district, to yield their conscientious convictions, or leave the State.

This is the character of the legislation on which the Arkansas Methodist Episcopal Conference requested one of its ministers to advocate before the Legislature of its State. [143-144]

A NEW ORLEANS paper states that the Mayor of that city regards the Louisiana Sunday law as objectionable, and a hardship upon poor people. He favors its strict enforcement, however, as the best means for securing its repeal.

CHINA ought to be the ideal National Reform country. A Chinese mandarin can order a man’s head to be cut off at any moment. But within three months he must forward to the Emperor an affidavit from two persons declaring that the execution *was in the interest of religion and morals.* He has no difficulty in getting such affidavits, as he can cut off the heads of any who refuse to make them.

REV. DR. HOWARD CROSBY has recently published a volume of lectures on the book of Revelation, in which he says that the spiritual ruin noticeable in so many countries where Christianity was once the prevailing creed, or where a nominal adherence to it is still the rule of the majority, is due to the admission of the world into the Church—“of joining the Church to the State; of forming alliances and friendships with the world; of compromising and thus letting down the standard of holiness and separation between Christ and Belial.”

BY means of a “decoy” letter the *Voice *obtained an interview with the manager of last year’s anti-Prohibition campaign in Pennsylvania; and in the interview it got a great host of matter that with great delight it published to the world. In the interview certain prominent and responsible men of Philadelphia were named, and certain things were said about them; but these men unanimously declare the statements to be without a particle of foundation in fact. Now the question presents itself, Who was it that was decoyed, the *Voice* or the other man? The *Voice* confessedly worked a deceitful trick to obtain information. How does the *Voice* know but what the other party did the same in giving the information? We confess that on reading the *Voice’s* account, there was a certain air of open innocence amounting almost to verdancy, which is very seldom found amongst men of such political experience as the gentleman who was interviewed. It is certain that names were given, and statements were made, with such an air of recklessness as to cast doubt upon the whole thing by reason of its very extravagance.

Taking the whole case as it stands, so far, we cannot help wondering whether the *Voice’s* decoy did not partake somewhat of the character of a boomerang. And the question is, Who was it that was decoyed?

IN an article entitled, “Thoughts on Conscience,” in *Word and Work,* Rev. E. Balley says:—

> A conscience illuminated and instructed by the word of God is free from condemnation, and is strong to bear the reproaches of men and the accusations of Satan. . . .

> Such a conscience is above the laws of men, and is not amenable to earthly tribunals. No civil power can have any control over the conscience. . . . In secular things we are to submit to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake, but in all religious things we are left to God and our conscience.
This is true, and it does not alter the case a particle to call civil that which is religious.
