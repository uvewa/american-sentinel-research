THERE is just now in Canada, considerable agitation of the same questions that are fast becoming so prominent in the United States, namely, the union of Church and State, Sunday laws, and religion in the public schools. On the question of religion and the public schools, as well as on that of the total separation between Church and State in everything, the following petition of the Baptists of Ontario and Quebec, is of interest. We wish the Baptists of the United States were as outspoken on these questions as are those of Canada. We know that in this country there are individual Baptists who have as clearly defined views on these questions, and as much readiness to express them, as the Baptists of Ontario and Quebec have shown themselves to have; but we have not yet heard of a single Baptist Association in the United States, which as a body has taken such a position. We should be glad to learn of scores of them. This report is taken from the *Canadian Baptist:—*

> *To the Honorable the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario.*

> The petition of the Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec humbly showeth:—
> 1. That the denomination of Christians called Baptists stands historically identified with, and has always been foremost in, maintaining certain principles touching civil and religious rights, which may be summarized as follows:—
> That the State is a political corporation simply; that freedom of religious opinion and worship is inherently a vested right of the individual con science, and not a grant from the State; that parliament may not prescribe any form of religious belief or worship, nor may it tax in any form any citizens for the support or teaching of religion.
> 2. That in harmony with these principles the following resolution was passed at the annual meeting of your petitioners, held in the city of Ottawa, in the month of October last: Moved by Rev. E. G. Boville, M. A., seconded by Rev. J. Dempsey, that,—
> *Whereas,* The historic belief of the Baptist Church has always been that Church and State should be separate, and that all citizens and denominations should be equal in every way before the law; and,—
> *Whereas,* Said principle is being violated in all ecclesiastical exemptions, whether in favor of Baptists or of other denominations: in the continuance of the mediaeval tithing system of the Roman Catholic denomination in Quebec; in the existence of separate schools supported out of public rates; in State provision for religious instruction in public schools; and in public grants for denominational purposes, as well as in other respects; therefore,—
> *Resolved,* That we hereby declare our conviction that the only permanent and sufficient remedy for these evils that are subversive of the principles of Religious Liberty and equality, and therefore a hindrance in the development of our national life, is the absolute and final separation of Church and State, and the revision of our constitution in harmony with the same.—Carried.
> 3. Believing that in all regards in which the State violates the principles above summarized, it transcends its rightful power and unjustly infringes on individual rights; and believing further, that nothing short of the thorough and consistent application of these principles throughout the whole Dominion will produce harmony and secure the welfare of the people of Canada, your petitioners: pray—
> That your Honorable Body may be pleased to speedily adopt measures,—
> 1. To absolutely abolish all exemption of ecclesiastical property and persons from their due share of municipal taxes and burdens.
> 2. To effectually prevent the making of gifts or i grants from the public funds to denominational institutions or purposes, whether charitable, educational, or otherwise.
> 3. To abolish all laws providing for the imparting of religious instruction in the public schools.
> 4. To bring about the entire abolition of separate denominational schools supported by rates levied by process of law.
> And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.
> Witness the hands of the President and Secretary of your petitioners, subscribed at Toronto this 17th day of March, A. D., 1890.
> (Signed) D. E. THOMSON.
> *President.*
> (Signed) JAMES GRANT.
> *Secretary.*
