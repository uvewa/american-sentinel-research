THE Methodists, in conference here, passed resolutions last Monday against the secularization of the common school education.

> "Purely secular education," say the resolutions "is impossible in a land whose literature, history, and laws are the product of a Christian civilization," "Christian citizens," they declare farther, "must deny the right of the State to assume to give such an inadequate education."

Yet the State can give no other than a purely secular education. It has no right to give any other, for we have no State religion to teach. The public schools must be wholly secular, or we must give them up.

That is the alternative, and Methodists, Baptists, Roman Catholics, and Episcopalians must look it squarely in the face. The schools must go, or they must remain secular, and become more so rather than less. *

If people's convictions lead them to require that their children shall receive in the schools which they attend, religious education along with the secular, they must send them to other than the public schools. If they do not think that they can give their children sufficient religious instruction at home and in the Sunday-schools of their churches to save them from spiritual peril, they must keep them out of the free schools maintained by public taxation. They must send them to religious schools of their way of thinking, and support such schools themselves.

In working for the introduction of religion into the public schools the Methodists are therefore, working for their destruction. There can be no question about that. They speak of the Roman Catholics in their resolutions as "enemies of the common schools;" but they are precisely as much enemies of the schools themselves when they demand what cannot be granted without breaking up the whole system. The schools must be altogether secular or they will be torn to pieces. There is no other logical conclusion.

As a mattor of fact, are the schools unsatisfactory to the public at large because they are necessarily purely secular?—They do not seem to be so. Everywhere they are crowded. The school accommodations in New York are insufficient to meet the demand upon them, and this demand [151] grows with the growth of the population. The complaints are, not of the absence of religious instruction, but that the secular education is not afforded to all and is not. what it should be.

The public schools are maintained simply to protect the State against the evils of illiteracy. Its citizens should know how to read and write. They are for no religious purpose whatsoever. The churches, maintained by voluntary contributions, must look after the matter of religion, each in its own way, and according to its own conscience and its own dogmas. *—New York Sun.*
