THE following article is taken from the argument of Mr. J. H. M. Wigman, before the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in the late case of the Bible in the public schools. The principles here announced are worthy of all acceptation. His statement of the divine right of the parent, is the truth of God:—

> If the Superintendent of Public Instruction has the right to place the King James version of the Bible in a list of text books and authorize the district board to adopt it as such and order or permit the teachers to read it to our children, then it necessarily follows that he has the right to adopt any other version; such right or power would make him the supreme in spiritual over our children and destroy all religious liberty and rights of conscience.

All the various versions of the Bible are sectarian books, whether it be the Douay version used by Catholics, or the King James version used by most Protestants, or the recently revised version given to the world by the American and English Commission. And it is a violation of our Constitution to allow any Bible, be it either Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, or Mormon, to be read in the public schools and thus force, or surreptitiously impose, a doctrine upon a child adverse to the faith of a parent.

It will not do to say that only certain chapters were read and that these chapters are substantially the same; if the teachers have the right to select these chapters, they have the right to select others. Neither will it do to say that the Bibles are substantially alike; every one who has ever made a comparison knows such is not the case. But suppose that all the Bibles were substantially the same, but that while Catholics so regarded them, Protestant neighbors should just as honestly, though mistakenly if you choose, take a very different view of the matter; would it, we ask, be right for Catholics because of their numerical majority to force Protestant children against the protesting consciences of their parents to study or read the Catholic instead of the Protestant Bible, accepting the Catholic *ipse dixit* for the fact that both Bibles were alike, while the Protestant could believe nothing of the kind? Certainly this would not be our idea of religious liberty, whether practiced by Catholic on Protestant or by Protestant on Catholic.

If the Superintendent of Public Instruction or the board of education of Edgerton, composed as it may be of self- righteous Christians may require the King James version of the Bible to be read to the children of unwilling parents, he or they may require it to be taught and expounded; another board made up of another class may require another version to be read, taught, and expounded: for while the Protestants have their King James version, the Catholics have their Douay version; the Jews, while rejecting the New Testament, have the Old for their Bible; the Mormons have their version and if the Board at any time be made up of professed infidels, they may substitute the teachings of Tom Paine's "Age of Reason," or another class may substitute the Koran.

The question is not as to whether the Catholic is right, for this is purely a theological question which not even the Legislature, in all the profundity of its wisdom and the plenitude of its power, has the authority to determine. The only thing which the State has a right to demand of Catholics is that they act the part of good citizens and the naked question, stripped of all disguises, resolves itself into this simple proposition:—

> "Can a Catholic, believing as he does about the Bible be a good and faithful citizen? If he can, why allow a school board or teacher to force upon the children of the relators an abandonment of their faith by impressing on their minds a doctrine contrary to the faith of their parents? Why mock them with the idea of religious liberty while compelling them to be taught that their religious belief which they derived from their parents is false?"

The reading of the King James version may be in accordance with the teachings of most Protestant sects, but it is against the teachings and belief of the Roman Catholic Church and if allowed, it gives one sect an advantage over another sect. It is an attempted control of and interference with the right of conscience, by giving a preference to the Protestant sect.

Our Constitution gives the right to every man to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of his own conscience and provides that that right shall never be infringed, nor shall any control of or interference with the right of conscience be permitted or any preference be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship. [SEC. 18, Art. 1, Constitution of Wisconsin.]

Judge Cooley in his work on Constitutional limitations, page 469, says: "There is no religious liberty where one sect is favored by the State and given an advantage over other sects. Whatever establishes a distinction against one class or sect is to the extent to which the distinction operates unfavorably, a persecution, and, if based on religious ground, a religious persecution."

We say then that the attempt of the district board and the teachers of the schools of Edgerton to read the Bible to the children of unwilling parents is a violation of the Constitution; it is a violation of the liberty of conscience; as much so as it would be to compel them to embrace Judaism or Paganism.

Suppose that at some future time a Jewish citizen should be elected to the office of Superintendent of Public Instruction, and that he should place upon, and recommend in, a list of text books, (amongst which should be Jewish books,) a Jewish Bible, and that the district board of Edgerton should be composed of Jewish citizens who, animated with the profundity of the wisdom of the present school board, should undertake to adopt such books, what would our self-righteous Christians, who now compose the school board, say? Would they raise no objection? Would they call this non-sectarian teaching? Would they allow a teacher, either directly or indirectly, to teach their children against their will, that he whom they believe to be the Messiah, the Lord, and Maker of heaven and earth was, after all, only an imposter? Are any of them base enough to answer this question in the affirmative? Upon what principles of justice dare they then deny to others the right and privilege they claim for themselves? It will not do to say that the Superintendent of Public Instruction has selected the King James version. Who has given him authority so to do, from so many other translations, no two of which even agree in all essential particulars?

Can he or the school board ostracise the children of a denomination of Christians by having a book introduced, read or taught as a "Bible" which they are taught and believe is not the Bible? We should be pleased to know what the qualifications of the Superintendent of Public Instruction or the school board are for ascertaining which amongst all the conflicting translations of the Bible is the correct one. Has either of them ever studied, or is either of them familiar not only with the Latin and Greek but also with the Hebrew, the original language of the Scripture? The Old Testament was written in Hebrew except some parts in Chaldee and Syriac. [148]

If the State Superintendent or the district school board of Edgerton may determine between the different religious denominations which has the correct version of the Bible and cause it to be read in the public schools to our children, against the will of their parents, it would completely overthrow everything in the shape of religious liberty, for it is a palpable violation of the principles of religious liberty to force anybody's child, whether the child of a Catholic, Protestant, Jew, or non-denominationalist, against the conscientious objections of its parents to listen to the reading of a book called "Bible," in which the parent does not believe.

*The parents are the only earthly sovereigns who rule directly by divine right. *This authority over their child and their exclusive right to train and educate it in their own way dates back to the very morning when the first born of Adam and Eve lay a helpless infant in the arms of its mother. This authority was afterwards re-affirmed and ratified by the Almighty from the mountain top where, with a tongue of lightning and a voice of thunder, he gave the command: "Honor thy father and thy mother;" and however poor and humble the family may be, there is surrounding its family government a "charmed circle" within which the mightiest monarch on earth should not dare uninvited to set his foot, or intrude his unwelcome presence; and this is the educational circle in religious matters; this is that sacred circle which encompasses the tender, plastic, untaught mind and heart during the earlier years of childhood, when the character of the future man or woman is in the embryo state and liable to be made or marred by the very slightest touch and to be swayed for good or evil by the most imperceptible influences.

It will not do to say that the State may step within this family circle and cut asunder the sacred bonds of love, harmony, and reciprocal confidence between parent and child, transfer the control of the child's religious education to the hands of strangers—public school teachers. It will not do to declare that the State, through the Superintendent of Public Instruction and a school board, has the right to control the consciences of the children against the will of their parents by prescribing the particular sources from which they shall derive their religious ideas and opinions,—a most dangerous power to be exercised in a free government. No; if the State Government desires to fill this land with free, intelligent, well-educated, upright, law-abiding men and women, let it not thwart the fathers and mothers in their honest endeavors to preserve intact their parental authority and to maintain the honor, dignity, and harmony of the family government by educating their own children in religious matters, according to their own best judgment and conscience.

> *The State that undertakes to teach religion in order to inculcate principles of good citizenship, will fail to secure either religion or good citizenship.*
