> *Any invasion of the rights of another done of purpose is persecution. Any invasion of the rights of others, by large bodies, is none the less persecution; and when these rights are rights of conscience, it is persecution, and the men who suffer from it feel it as persecution the moment their attention is addressed to it. The moment that a Jew becomes aware that his taxes are appropriated to a form of worship alien to his faith, and which teaches its falsehood, he is persecuted, and it is only a question of time and humanity whether those who persecute him shall be persuaded to persecute him more.*
