THE Telluride *Republican* should experience no difficulty in deciding what the AMERICAN SENTINEL means. That journal cuts too clean to be misunderstood. It objects to placing God on a level with vile man, and *The Graphic *takes the same high ground. The religion that Jesus of Nazareth taught, first; the statutes of the State next. Both separate and distinct.—*Colorado Graphic. *[153]
