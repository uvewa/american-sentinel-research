# Its Mission.

THE mission of the Religious Liberty Association is to present to the world, the principles of civil and religious liberty as taught by Christ. Those who do that acceptably, must be animated by his spirit. The following from the pen of A. F. Ballenger, Ass’t Secretary of the Association, in the February *Home Missionary,* is worthy of the thoughtful attention of every solicitor, colporter, writer and lecturer of the Association.

It must be borne in mind that the work of the National Religious Liberty Association is a labor of love. It is a missionary work, and those engaged in it should be actuated by the same spirit which impelled the great Missionary to give its principles to the world eighteen hundred years ago.

Agitators of political principles expect to be victorious, and as a result of their labors, receive worldly positions of honor and profit. Not so with us; our victory, though sure, will not be celebrated until those who have “gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.” With the result of the work reaching into eternity, how careful we should be not to wound the feelings of those for whom we work, by harsh and unkind expressions. The most of those engaged in securing religious legislation are honest, and should be so regarded. This is proved from the fact that many who have signed the petition favoring religious legislation, have, when the matter was clearly and kindly presented to them, signed the counter-petition, and worked in its favor. These cases are not confined to the less intelligent, but ministers and members of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union are among them. The president of the Association recently stated the truth, when he said, “Were it not for the special light received, many of us would be on the side of error in this conflict.”

Workers will meet, at times, with bitter opposition, but instead of being harsh or becoming discouraged, “consider Him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.”W. H. M.

THE case of R. M. King, in which lie was fined seventy-five dollars for Sunday labor, by Judge Swiggart, in the Circuit Court of Obion County, Tennessee, and appealed to the Supreme Court, will be argued on appeal during the present term of court. The case will be reached some time in May. The similar case against L. A. Callicott in the Circuit Court of Dyer County, has been continued to await the action of the Supreme Court, in the appealed case of Mr. King.

C. MCREYNOLDS, State Secretary for Kansas, sends an interesting account of his work in that State. He finds it possible to accomplish more in the towns and villages, than in the large cities. The inhabitants of the cities are so preoccupied with business and pleasure, that it is more difficult to gain their attention upon abstract subjects.

In regard to the method to be followed in the lecture field, Secretary McReynolds says: “I would go only as fast as I could secure others to continue the work of circulating the petitions, and also, when it is possible, enlist one or more in handling the tracts, SENTINELS, and pamphlets.”

THE *Nevada Tribune,* of March 20, published at Carson City, Nevada, contains an account of a mass-meeting held in the opera house of that city on the evening of March 19. The *Tribune* says:—

> There was an enthusiastic meeting at the Carson Opera House last evening, and it was clearly shown that the sentiment of the people of the capital of Nevada, was practically unanimous, against the passage of the proposed Blair Sunday rest bill, as well as intended legislation leading to the establishment of religion in the public schools of the land.

Resolutions were adopted, condemning the measures of religious legislation, involved in the Blair Sunday-rest bill, the Breckinridge Sunday bill for the District of Columbia, and the Blair amendments to the Constitution to provide for the teaching of the principles of religion in the schools.

THE *Daily Imprint,* of Petaluma, California, appropriately remarks:—

> Senator Blair has re-introduced his bill providing for a National Sabbath. Senator Blair has fathered many objectionable measures in his day and generation, and this is probably the least meritorious. It is contrary to the very genius and spirit of our institutions. If the generality of mankind cannot agree by unanimous consent upon the observance of a certain day, no attempt should be made to legislate them into the observance of any day.
