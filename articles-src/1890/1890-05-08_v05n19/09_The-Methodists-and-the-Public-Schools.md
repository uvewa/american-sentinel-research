ON the last day of its session the Methodist Conference in this city adopted resolutions against secularizing the instruction in the public schools. "Purely secular education," say the resolutions, "is impossible in a land whose literature, history, and laws are the product of Christian civilization." "Christian citizens," they declare further, "must deny the right of the State to assume to give such an inadequate education."

We should look upon this action of the Conference as a more grievous one than we do, but for the fact that it will accomplish nothing in the way of diverting the public school moneys to sectarian ends. The plain fact is whether or not it be true that purely secular education is impossible in a Christian land: it certainly is true that only secular education can be given in the common schools. The moment sectarian instruction is given, that moment the schools cease to be "common" or "public;" that moment the Catholics are driven out of them, as are the Jews and those of other religions, while if evangelical instruction is supplied the Unitarians will be driven out; and what a "confusion worse confounded" we should have! Our Methodist friends declare their attachment to the public schools; but their course would destroy the schools. That this is so is evidenced by the fact that the Roman Catholics are in entire accord with our Methodist friends in their position. They say, with the Methodists, not merely that children must be religiously educated—for we are all agreed as to that—but that this sectarian education—and all religious education is sectarian—must be supplied by the State.

To this position *The Christian at Work *cannot for a moment assent. Religion is necessary to the children, but it must be supplied by the Christian home, by the church and Sunday-school, and by other Christian agencies. The public schools are maintained to protect the State against the evils of illiteracy. Its citizens should know how to read and write, and perform the simple operations of arithmetic. And they should be made familiar with the history of their own country. But further than this the State should not go; nor can it go in the direction the Methodists wish without disestablishing the schools—and in this work the Catholics are with the Methodists, yet singularly enough, in their resolutions the Conference stigmatizes the Romanists as "enemies of the common schools."

We do not here consider the value of a half-hour's instruction in religion in the public schools, nor traverse the qualifications of the teachers to impart such instruction. We only put before our readers the situation as it presents itself to this journal, with the conviction that they who would force sectarianism into the public schools as the Roman Catholics and the Methodist Conference would, are compassing the destruction of these schools.— *Christian at Work.*
