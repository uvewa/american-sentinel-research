THE following extract is from the concurring opinion of Justice Orton in the decision of the Wisconsin Supreme Court. It is the clearest statement of the case of the "common school" that we have seen, and is valuable as well for its sound principles:—

I most fully and cordially concur in the decision and in the opinions of Justices Lyon and Cassoday in this case.

It is not needful that any other opinion should be written, but I thought it proper to state briefly some of the reasons which have induced such concurrence in the decision.

> The right of every man to worship almighty God according to the dictates of his own conscience shall never be infringed; nor shall any man be compelled to attend, erect or support any place of worship; . . . nor shall any control or interference with the rights of conscience be permitted or any preference be given by law to any religious establishments or modes of worship.—Constitution, Art. 1, Sec. 18.

> No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification for any office of public trust, under the State, and no person shall be rendered incompetent to give evidence in any court of law or equity, in consequence of his opinions on the subject of religion.—Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 19.
> The interest of "the school fund," and all other revenues derived from the school lands shall be exclusively applied, etc, to the support and maintenance of *common schools* in each school district, etc.—Art. X, Sec. 2, subdivision 1.
> The Legislature shall provide by law for the establishment of district schools which shall be as nearly *uniform* as practicable; and such schools shall be *free,* and without charge for tuition, to *all* children between the ages of four, and twenty [150] years; and no *sectarian* instruction shall be allowed therein.—Art. X, Sec. 3.
> Each town and city shall be required to raise *by tax* annually for the support of *common schools *therein a sum not less, etc.—Art. X, Sec. 4. Provision shall be made by law for the distribution of the income of the school fund among the several towns and cities of the State for the support of *common schools* therein, etc.—Art. X, Sec. 5.
These provisions of the Constitution are cited together to show how completely this State as a civil Government, and all its civil institutions, are divorced from all possible connection or alliance with any and all religions, religious worship, religious establishments or modes of worship, and with everything of a religious character or appertaining to religion; and to show how completely all are protected in their religion and rights of conscience, and that no one shall ever be taxed, or compelled to support any religion or place of worship, or to attend upon the same; and more especially to show that our *common schools,* as one of the institutions of the State created by the Constitution, stand, in all these respects, like any other institution of the State, completely excluded from all possible connection or alliance with religion or religious worship, or with anything of a religious character, and guarded by the constitutional prohibition that "no sectarian instruction shall be *allowed* therein."

They show also that the common schools are free to all alike, to all nationalities, to all sects of religion, to all ranks of society, and to all complexions. For these equal privileges and rights of instruction in them, all are taxed equally and proportionately. The constitutional name, "common schools," expresses their equality and universal patronage and support. *Common* schools are not common as being low in character or grade, but *common* to all alike, to everybody and to all sects or denominations of religion, but without bringing religion into them. The common schools, like all the other institutions of the State, are protected by the Constitution from all "control or interference with the rights of conscience," and from all preferences given by law to any religious establishments or modes of worship.

As the State can have nothing to do with religion except to protect every one in the enjoyment of his own, so the common schools can have nothing to do with religion in any respect whatever. They are as completely secular as any of the other institutions of the State, in which all the people alike have equal rights and privileges. The people cannot be taxed for religion in schools more than anywhere else. Religious instruction in the common schools is as clearly prohibited by these general clauses of the Constitution as religious instruction or worship in any other department of State supported by the revenues derived from taxation.

The clause that "no sectarian instruction shall be allowed therein" was inserted *ex industria* to exclude everything pertaining to religion. They are called by those who wish to have not only religion, but their own religion taught therein, "godless schools." They are godless, and the educational department of the Government is godless, in the same sense that the executive, legislative, and administrative departments are godless. So long as our Constitution remains as it is, no one's religion can be taught in our common schools. . . . Let it once enter into our civil affairs, our Government would soon be destroyed. Let it once enter into our common schools, they would be destroyed. Those who made our Constitution saw this, and used the most apt and comprehensive language in it to prevent such a catastrophe.

No State Constitution ever existed that so completely excludes and precludes the possibility of religious strife in the civil affairs of the State, and yet so fully protects all alike in the enjoyment of their own religion. All sects and denominations may teach the people their own doctrines in all proper places. Our Constitution protects all and favors none. But they must keep out of the common schools and civil affairs. It requires but little argument to prove that the Protestant version of the Bible, or any other version of the Bible, is the source of religious strife and opposition, and opposed to the religious belief of many of our people. It is a sectarian book. The Protestants were a very small sect in religion at one time, and they are a sect yet, to the great Catholic Church against whose usages they protested, and so is their version of the Bible sectarian, as against the Catholic version of it.

The common school is one of the most indispensable, useful, and valuable civil institutions this State has. It is democratic, and free to all alike, in perfect equality, where all the children of our people stand on a common platform, and may enjoy the benefits of an equal and common education. An enemy to our common schools is an enemy to our State Government. It is the same hostility that would cause any religious denomination that had acquired the ascendancy over all others to remodel our Constitution, and change our Government and all of its institutions, so as to make them favorable only to itself, and exclude all others from their benefits and protection. In such an event, religious and sectarian instruction will be given in all schools. Religion needs no support from the State. It is stronger and much purer without it.

This case is important and timely. It brings before the courts a case of the plausible, insidious, and apparently innocent entrance of religion into our civil affairs, and of an assult upon the most valuable provisions of the Constitution. Those provisions should be pondered and heeded by all of our people, of all nationalities and of all denominations of religion, who desire the perpetuity and value the blessings of our free Government.
