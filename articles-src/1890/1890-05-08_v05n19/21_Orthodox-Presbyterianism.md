WE here present an extract from the speech of Hon. Stanley Matthews in the Cincinnati case of the Bible in the schools. In these times when Presbyterian Synods and Presbyterian papers are demanding that the State shall teach religion, and denouncing Supreme Court decisions to the contrary, it is important that the public, as well as the Presbyterians themselves, should know just what is orthodox Presbyterianism on this question. Mr. Matthews said:—

I wish, partly as a personal gratification to myself, and partly for the sound and wholesome truth conveyed in sound and wholesome words, which it contains, to read to your Honors a part of the confession of the church to which I belong, on the duties and functions of the civil magistrate. *The Westminster Confession of Faith,* chapter xxiii, section 3, says:—

> Civil magistrates may not assume to themselves the administration of the word and sacraments, or the power of the keys of the kingdom of heaven, or in the least interfere in the matters of faith. Yet, as nursing fathers, it is the duty of civil magistrates to protect the church of our common Lord without giving the preference to any denomination of Christians above the rest, in such manner that all ecclesiastical persons whatever shall enjoy the full, free and unquestioned liberty of discharging every part of their sacred functions, without violence or danger. And as Jesus Christ hath appointed a regular government and discipline in his church, no law of any commonwealth should interfere with, let or hinder the due exercise thereof among the voluntary members of any denomination of Christians, according to their own profession and belief. It is the duty of civil magistrates to protect the person and good name of all their people in such an effectual manner as that no person be suffered, either upon pretense of religion or infidelity, to offer any indignity, violence, abuse or injury to any other person whatsoever; and to take order that all religious and ecclesiastical assemblies be held without molestation or disturbance.

Thus, may it please your Honors, am I taught by my own church—a church which teaches elsewhere in the same confession that "God alone is lord of the conscience" —and which here plainly defines and declares its own rights and the rights of the whole Christian Church, and the limits of the civil power in respect of them; and in so doing denies to the civil magistrate any assumed right *in the administration of the word,* which means neither more nor less, than, any part or lot in instructing in religion—denies his right, *in the least, to interfere in matters of faith,* which he attempts to exert when, by law, he decrees that a particular version or translation of the Bible shall be publicly read, as part of a system of religious worship and instruction, by and to particular persons, at stated times and places, thereby implicitly sitting in judgment upon the questions relating to its inspiration, its canonical character, the accuracy of its translation, its character and claims as the word of God, and opening the way, if such a power is admitted, for a further claim, to expound, interpret and teach by authority its true meaning; denies his right to give the preference to any denomination of Christians above the rest, a right which is clearly exercised where the State authorities, school boards or courts of law imperatively ordain a form of religious devotion to be practiced, or a mode of religious instruction to be adopted, in the public and common schools, which the consciences of any Christian denomination prevent them from attending, supporting or countenancing; declares the right of every denomination of Christians, to exercise its discipline and government ecclesiastically, among its voluntary members, according to their own profession and belief, without let, hindrance or interference with, by the law of any commonwealth. . . . .

But this noble article of the Westminster Confession of Faith goes one step farther, in its vindication of the rights of conscience against the power of the civil magistrate. It recognizes and throws the mantle of its protection, not merely over rights which it claims for those whom it regards as peculiarly its own—the confessors of its own faith—but concedes the same *to all others,* even to those who deny, not only its own confession, but the very faith itself—even infidels; for it maintains it to be the duty of civil Government equally to protect and defend all the people, both in person and good name, and so effectually, that no person be suffered to offer any indignity, violence, abuse or injury to any other person whatsoever, *either upon pretense of religion or infidelity!*

In other words it is not orthodox Presbyterianism in this country, to deny to an infidel the same civil rights that belong to a saint. [152]
