JANUARY 27, the directors of the Young Men's Christian Association of Milwaukee, Wis., gave formal notice to the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, of that place, that the Union could no longer have the use of the Association building. The reason is that "having allied themselves with the Prohibition party," the women must be treated as other political organizations are and therefore must be excluded from occupying the rooms of the Association. We think that a very proper action on the part of the Young Men's Christian Association. The Woman's Christian Temperance Union has ceased to be anything but a political club, and its work anything less than a continuous political campaign. We hope that by some means the Union may be enabled to discover this, and turn once more to its proper, legitimate, and chartered object—the promotion of Christain temperance, and that by Christian methods. The management of the Young Men's Christian Association, which through all the ups and downs of the day has kept it straight on its Christian course clear of all entanglements, is worthy of the highest admiration on the part of everybody, as it has it on the part of the AMERICAN SENTINEL.
