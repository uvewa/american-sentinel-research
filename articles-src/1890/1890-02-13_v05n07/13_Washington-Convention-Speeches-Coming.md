WE have full *verbatim* reports of all the speeches made in the Washington City Sunday Law Convention. As soon as we can get them turned from shorthand into type-written copy, we hope to print them with comments, in the SENTINEL if possible. The speeches are so thoroughly representative of the movement we want all our readers to have them. They may, however, prove to be too long to print in the SENTINEL with the necessary comments. If that should be the case we hope to be able to issue them as a number of the *Sentinel Library.*
