REFERRING to the Blair Sunday bill, the Cokato (Minn.) *Observer* says:—

> "In view of the work that is being done to accomplish the passage of this bill it is time that its opponents should take the matter in hand and speak with no uncertain voice against its passage. There is one thing that the American citizen feels especial pride in, and that is the religious freedom vouchsafed to us in the Constitution. Let us keep this intact and not entrust our representatives in Congress with questions concerning our spiritual welfare but leave that matter to ourselves and our God." [55-56]
