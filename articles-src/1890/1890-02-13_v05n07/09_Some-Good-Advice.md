THE Woman's Christian Temperance Union convention is made up of women of high character and lofty aspiration; of women who do not hesitate to point to themselves as models of Christian conduct and charity. They cannot afford to descend to the methods or to manifest the spirit of the low-grade and bitterly partisan ward meetings. Neither Miss Willard nor any of her associates can afford to speak with the recklessness or the heat of the stump-speaker, aiming only at present effect. . . . There is a special call for honesty on their part in their dealing with men and women. They must remember that liquor-selling and liquor-drinking are not the only sins in the world. According to St. Augustine "all selfishness is sin, and all sin is selfishness."

The women of the convention who profess to speak for 140,000 other women can not afford to adopt the narrow policy of looking only at the welfare or the reputation of their own members. They are on trial, like other people. They will stand or fall as they are honest or dishonest, just or unjust, charitable or uncharitable. They must remember that they are not a mutual admiration society, to be fed on self-praise, and with license to judge and punish all who differ with them. Self- praise is well enough in its way, but it will not make a record before the public. To announce a good purpose is commendable, but a mere announcement is but a step toward accomplishment.

The people expect a good deal of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. They have been grievously disappointed. If they lose faith in the high purpose and Christian spirit of the organization the tide will soon turn. We desire, we strongly desire, that the people keep their faith in the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and that the organization have long life to accomplish great good. Hence this plain speech.—*Inter-Ocean.*
