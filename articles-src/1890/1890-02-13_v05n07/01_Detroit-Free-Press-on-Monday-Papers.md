THE Detroit (Mich.) *Free Press*, makes the following good point against those preachers who propose to have Monday morning's paper printed Saturday night, before midnight:—

> "There is a minister in Minnesota who thinks a Monday paper can just as well be prepared Saturday night. His congregation should keep a sharp lookout on him. A man with a notion of that kind is quite capable of ringing in a 10-year-old sermon on his people for a fresh one."
