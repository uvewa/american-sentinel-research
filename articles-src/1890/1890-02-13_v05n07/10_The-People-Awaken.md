# The People Awaken.

UNDER the auspices of the National Religious Liberty Association, there was held in Washington City, Tuesday, January 28, a citizens’ meeting for the discussion of the Breckinridge Sunday bill for the District of Columbia. A good deal of preliminary work had been done. Nearly 20,000 SENTINELS and 8,000 circulars of announcement had been distributed, and eight hundred personal invitations sent out, besides printed notices in all the city papers. As a result between five hundred and six hundred people assembled. General A. A. Birney presided. The meeting was intended to be an impartial discussion of the bill. The personal invitations which were sent to all the ministers, Woman’s Christian Temperance Union workers, and to six hundred lawyers of the city, besides a personal letter to Mr. W. F. Crafts, read as follows, the first being to the lawyers

> January 24, 1890, City. DEAR SIR:

> Your attention is called to the bill for a District Sunday law now pending in the House. A citizens’ meeting will be held in the Rink, on New York Avenue, between Thirteenth and Fourteenth Streets, Tuesday, the 28th, at 7:30 p. m., for the impartial discussion of the merits of this bill. You are asked to be present. If you will speak on the question please notify J. O. Corliss, 217 Fifth, Street, S. E., stating whether you will favor or oppose the bill.
> Yours respectfully.
> THE COMMITTEE.
To the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union:—

> January 27, 1890, City. DEAR MADAM:

> A meeting will be held at the Rink, on New York Avenue, between Thirteenth and Fourteenth Streets, the evening of Tuesday, the 28th, to discuss the merits of the local Sunday bill for the District of Columbia, which Mr. Breckinridge of Kentucky, has introduced in the House.
> An opportunity will be given at this meeting for an impartial discussion of the question. Both those who favor and those who oppose the passage of Sunday laws have been requested to be present and speak. You, as a resident of the District of Columbia, and a member of that organization which is exerting a greater moral force than any other organization in the land, the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, should take an active and intelligent interest in this question in all its phases.
> We are sure you are anxious to know all that can be said upon this matter, both for and against. It is therefore hoped that no previous engagement will preclude your attending this meeting.
> Respectfully.
> THE COMMITTEE.
Yet with all this effort but one person could be found to speak in favor of the bill. One other gentleman had promised to speak for the bill, but in the meeting turned against it, and openly opposed it. To the invitation Mr. Crafts replied:—

> Your letter overtook me after several days. Our side of the case will be sufficiently presented at our convention.W. F. CRAFTS.

The speeches, which, with the exception noted, were necessarily against the bill, will be given later, as we have time now only to print this hasty notice. At the close of the addresses the following resolutions were enthusiastically adopted:—

> *Resolved,* That the bill (H. R. 3854), entitled “An act to prevent persons from being forced to labor on Sunday,” does not meet our approbation, but that we do earnestly protest against its passage, or the passage of any bill of similar import, for the following reasons, to wit:

> First. There is no call or occasion for the passage of such a law. No person in the District of Columbia is, or has been forced to labor on Sunday against his will, at any time since the abolition of slavery therein.
> Second. Works of necessity or mercy are not defined in the bill, and their meaning and application are left to the arbitrary prejudice or caprice of police magistrates. Under such a law, street cars railroad trains, steamboats and private carriages might be stopped; and a citizen might be fined for preaching, for shaving himself, or having his dinner cooked on Sunday.
> Third. Such a law would be a departure from the fundamental principle of the institutions of this country, which recognizes the right of a citizen to do as he pleases, provided he does not encroach upon the rights of others; and it empowers a police judge to inquire into and decide upon the conscientious beliefs of any citizen charged with doing, or causing to be done, secular work on Sunday.
> Fourth. The passage of such a law is designed, and in effect would be an entering wedge for a system of aggressive laws tending to subvert the secular character of our Government in derogation of the Constitution, and the religious freedom of the citizen guaranteed thereby.
> Fifth. The proposed law partakes of the most offensive features of the early laws of New England, Maryland, and other colonies of the olden time, known as “Blue laws,” and is therefore a long step backward, instead of forward in human progress.
The unanimous sentiment is that it was a most successful meeting. A. T. J
