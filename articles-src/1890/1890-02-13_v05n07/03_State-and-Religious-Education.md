WHAT the State should do, for reasons of public policy in which all the people have a common interest, is to afford an opportunity for education in secular knowledge which all alike need. Confining itself to this sphere in its common school system, it should have nothing to do with the teaching of any religion, whether Catholic or Protestant, denominational or undenominational, pagan or Christian. Religious teaching, as such, belongs to the family and the Church, and can be much better managed by these agencies than by any system organized, conducted, and governed by the State. The moment the State passes beyond its legitimate province on this subject, it discriminates between the people on religious grounds, and in effect becomes a religious propagandist at the public expense; and this is sure always to. be oppressive to somebody. Let the State mind its own business, and let the Church mind its own business, and then there will be no conflict between the two.—*N. Y. Independent.*
