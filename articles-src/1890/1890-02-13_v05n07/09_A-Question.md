# A Question.

IN Brooklyn, N. Y., four persons were convicted and fined from $100 to $500, for refusing to give to certain children medicine prescribed by physicians, choosing rather to treat the children by other means. They were people who believe in the “faith cure,” and the children died, hence, the prosecution and the punishment. This has caused much discussion in the public press, some taking one side and others the other. All that we shall say just at this time is simply to inquire, How would it do to impose such a fine upon those who do not believe in this method of treatment—the doctors for instance—every time they lose a case? [47-48]

WE have received the first number of the *Southern Sentinel,* published at Dallas, Texas. It is devoted to the same cause as the AMERICAN SENTINEL. We heartily wish it success. May such *Sentinels* be posted all along the line.

THE “call” for that National Reform convention, lately held in Cincinnati, was signed by eighty-two persons. Seventy- three of these were preachers, the rest were made of eight laymen and one woman. And yet they try to pass that off as a representative “citizens” meeting, simply in the interests of the State!

SECTION 11, of Article 1, of the Constitution of the new State of Washington, contains this sentence: “No public money or property shall be appropriated for or applied to any religious worship, exercise or instruction, or to the support of any religious establishment.” Yet, as plain as that is, it was attempted when the Legislature met to have a chaplaincy established for the State and the legislative sessions to be opened with prayer. The scheme failed as it was proper that it should. The word “exercise” shut off that relic of the union of Church and State.

ACCORDING to the *Colorado Graphic* of January 18, the people of Denver are losing interest in the Sunday-closing crusade, inaugurated there some months since. At a recent meeting in the interest of the crusade, which the Denver *News* described as “another of those great meetings,” it is stated that only one hundred and seventy- two persons were present, by actual count, “including forty-one ladies and ten or more children.” This certainly does not look very much like “a great popular uprising,” especially in a city of the size of Denver. One great trouble about this movement is, that while its real object is the exaltation of Sunday, it professes to be primarily a temperance movement. A great many temperance people see this, and hence stand aloof from the movement which would otherwise have their support. That sort of prohibition which proposes to compromise with the saloons, allowing them six-seventh of the time in which to carry on their business, is not worthy of the name of temperance, and not a few are beginning to see it.

THE National League for the Protection of American Institutions, by its Law Committee, has reported the form of an amendment to the national Constitution, which it intends to ask shall be adopted. It reads as follows:—

> No State shall pass any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or use its property, mony or credit, or any power of taxation, or authorize either to be used for the purpose founding, maintaining or aiding any church, religious denomination or religious society, or any institution, or undertaking under sectarian or ecclesiastical control.

That might be made a part of the Constitution of the United States, and yet, under the decisions religion could be taught and religious exercises conducted in the public schools in all the States where it is now done. Such, however, is not according to American principles, therefore the League’s proposed amendment ought to be amended at once.
