THE Secretary of the Philadelphia Sun- day-law Association, Rev. T. A. Fernley, reports that there are in that city "283 Personal Liberty Leagues, representing 35,000 men, who will next autumn show their hand in politics" in opposition to Sunday laws. Can the Church carry on a political contest with such an element as that and keep herself pure? Merely to contemplate such a prospect ought to convince the Church instantly and once for all that such is not the field where she is to put forth her efforts.
