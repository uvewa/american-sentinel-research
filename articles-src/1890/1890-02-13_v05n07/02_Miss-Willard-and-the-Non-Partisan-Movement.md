Miss WILLARD finds that the non-partisan Woman's Christian Temperance Union movement is proving to be of more importance than she suspected. It seemed to be a very light thing at the time of the National Convention in November last, but now there seems to be some alarm; for she has found it necessary to issue a national address, pleading for the old organization "to be kept up," and saying that "local branches must be maintained so long as a single white ribboner is left." We wish success to the non-partisan movement, and hope that that movement may bring the temperance work back to its original intent, and to sound principles.
