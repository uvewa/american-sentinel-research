THE *Dawn* is a new paper published in Boston, "to advocate and explain Christian socialism, and to favor all measures practically looking to a realization of socialism in the name of Christ." "Christian socialism" is simply another name for so-called National Reform, and the *Dawn* is simply another National Reform organ, with variations.
