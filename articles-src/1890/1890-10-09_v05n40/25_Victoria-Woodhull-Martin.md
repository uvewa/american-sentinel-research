AND now we are to be afflicted by another form of paternalism in government, or at least by another paternal theory. Mrs. Victoria C. Woodhull Martin's latest idea of government embraces these cardinal points: Only healthy people shall marry; legislators are to be versed in psychology and pathology; courts are to be presided over by scientists, who will study the mental condition of criminals and prescribe proper treatment; cabinets are to be composed of philosophers, representing every branch of science, whose chief duty will be to look after the internal welfare of the people, see to the sanitary condition of all the factories, dwellings, etc., and find employment for all working people. "Mrs. Martin," remarks the *World,* "hopes to live to see this ideal government established, and then die and be known to history as the father of it, as it were."

When will the nonsense of attempting to legislate this earth into a paradise, end?
