IN answering a correspondent, who complained of railroad companies' creating "a class of deliberate Sabbath-breakers," by running their trains upon Sunday, among other things, the *Christian at Work*, says this:—

> We deplore the Sabbath desecration that exists. At the same time let us remember that what is necessary and promotive of public good on Sunday, is not a desecration—Christ's declarations as to which, the reader will readily recall.

We confess our inability to "readily recall" anywhere in the Bible, a passage where either the Saviour or apostles referred to the possible profanation of "the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday." Will the *Christian at Work *kindly cite us to the chapter, and verse?
