FOLLOWING is one of the "reasons" given in one of the California Sunday-law documents, for a "civil" Sunday law:—

> "The sacredness of the Sunday is the laborer's only shield." The Sabbath as a political institution is of inestimable value, independently of its claim to divine authority. There is no danger of destroying the Christian religion so long as the Christian Sabbath is acknowledged and kept as a sacred day.

So after all the great "reason" for Sunday laws is the preservation of the Christian religion. But there was a time in the history of Christianity when it was not only preserved, but when it actually flourished, not only without laws in its favor, but under bitter persecution. Why does it now need the support of civil law? Has Christianity lost its power? or have its professors lost all spirit of self-sacrifice that they now demand laws to remove from the Christian pathway every difficulty?
