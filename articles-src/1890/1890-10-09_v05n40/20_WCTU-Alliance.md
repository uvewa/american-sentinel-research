THE Woman's Christian Temperance Union, having secured an alliance with the National Reform Association, the American Sabbath Union, and the Prohibition Party, is now laying its snares to catch the Salvation Army; but our advice to the Salvation Army is, that if it wishes to continue to do the good work which it has been doing so long, let it diligently refuse to allow itself to be joined in any way with the Woman's Christian Temperance Union.
