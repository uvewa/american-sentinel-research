"FIRESIDE SKETCHES," is the name of one of the most attractive and valuable juvenile books that has ever come to our table. It is a new subscription book of nearly 200 pages, eight by eleven inches, substantially and handsomely bound in blue cloth, ink-stamped, and in red cloth, embossed in jet and gold, the latter being of course the more attractive binding. But beautiful as is the outside of this book, the inside is even more attractive, because of the matter which the book contains, and the illustrations with which it abounds. The following partial list of subjects, all of which are treated in a most interesting and instructive manner, will give a good idea of the scope of the book:—

> The Falls of the Yosemite, California Big Trees, General Grant in Siam, The Chinese in California, Columbia River, Salt Lake City, Alaska, The Frozen North, Volcanoes and Earthquakes, Encounter with an Iceberg, Zambesi Falls, Africa, Land of the Midnight Sun, South Sea Islands, Rip Van Winkle, etc.

There is also a "Miscellaneous Department" of unusual interest to both old and young. The whole book is profusely illustrated, containing over 150 beautiful and instructive illustrations, over twenty- five of which are full page engravings. Besides the engravings, there are four excellent maps. Of the illustrations in "Fireside Sketches," the publishers say: "The illustrations have been procured with great care. Some we have been able to find in our own country, but many have had to be engraved especially for the work, or imported from foreign collections. No labor or expense has been spared to make this work as perfect as possible." The book itself bears witness to the correctness of this statement.

Persons who desire to learn book canvassing, cannot do better than to secure an agency for "Fireside Sketches," at once, and thus take advantage of the approaching holiday season. It is a book that will sell at sight, in almost every home where there are children or youth, and even the older people will want it for their own reading.

> "Fireside Sketches" is published by the Central Manufacturing Company, Battle Creek, Michigan; Eastern agency, 43 Bond Street, New York, N. Y.
