# Public Schools.

## What Are They? For What Purpose Maintained?

OUR system of free public schools is now legally established in all the States, and supported by a strong public sentiment. The public school has myriads of friends, and but few avowed enemies. There is, however, a misconception, on the part of some, as to what they are, and for what purpose they are maintained. Some regard the public schools as semireligious, originated and maintained for the purpose of teaching, among other things, the doctrines of the Christian religion. Without stopping to show how impossible it would be, in this land of every diversity of creed, from that of the Mussulman to that of the Methodist, to teach a religion without doing violence to some tax-payer’s ideas of the only true faith, let us examine the origin and intent of the public schools.

The civil Government has created and maintained the public school for selfpreservation. Ignorance may prolong the existence of a despotic form of government, but the stability of a republic in which the responsibility of government rests on all alike, depends upon the intelligent action of the mass of the people. Realizing this, each State has made provision for the maintenance of a system of free public schools, by universal taxation, —Protestants, Catholics, Jews, and infidels being taxed alike for their support. The public school rests upon the foundation of political necessity. It has in view, not only the happiness and well-being of the individual, but the preservation of the State, and is therefore a purely civil institution maintained for political purposes,— neither in the interest of, nor in opposition to, religion. The public schools, as a part of our governmental policy, come under Lincoln’s definition of government; they are “of the people, by the people, and for the people.” They are neither by nor for the Protestant, the Catholic, nor the infidel, as such, but are for the *people*, without reference to religion.

It is an undisputed principle in political economy, that the State may appropriate money raised by taxation to purposes which are only of general necessity or of supreme utility, and which can be attained by the State only, or by the State to a degree or in a way very superior to those of private effort. It is on this principle that the State refuses to require the teaching of religion in the public school supported by general taxation. The teaching of religion is not an object to be attained by the State only, neither can the objects of religion be attained by the State to a degree or in a way superior to those of private effort. All history proves that the State, as a teacher of religion, is a disastrous failure. In placing the common school on a purely civil basis, the State does not, in any way, antagonize religion. It is simply an acknowledgment that the teaching of religion is outside its jurisdiction; that religion is a matter not to be handled by the State.

While this view of the public school is regarded by the majority as self-evident, there are some who, because of this attitude of our schools toward religion, declare that they are “godless.” This comes from a misconception of the province of civil Government, and the mission of the public school. Had God delegated to civil Government the teaching of religion, a failure to do it by means of the public school might merit such criticism. The State, in providing for the teaching of reading, writing, and mathematics, without teaching religion, is simply attending to its legitimate business, which the Church does when it attends to the teaching of religion. The term *godless* cannot be applied with any more consistency to the common school because the Bible is not read and religion is not taught in it, than it can be to schools of phonography, telegraphy, or art, because the Bible is not taught in them, or than the term *traitor* can be applied to the Church, because it does not teach the principles of civil government, civil engineering, and military tactics.

The unparalleled success achieved by our system of free public schools, is due in great part to their freedom from that disturbing element, religious controversy. Had our public schools taught a system of religion which antagonized the beliefs of the Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists, Universalists, Unitarians, Jews, or infidels, they would not have been supported and patronized as they are to-day. When the course of study in the public schools is confined to secular instruction, and the teaching of religion is left to the parent, the denominational school, and the Church, all classes can patronize them. But let religion be taught, and all whose views of religion are antagonized, are compelled, in self-defense, to withdraw their children from the schools which they are taxed to maintain. Our public schools have been, and ever will be, the main arteries through which is furnished the life-blood of our glorious Republic; and, in view of this, should be carefully guarded against the introduction of anything which is foreign to them, and destructive of their usefulness.—*A. F. Ballenger, in N. R. L. A. Leaflet. *[303-304]

THE statement comes from Winnipeg, that a serious charge has been brought against Lieutenant - Governor Royal, of Northwest Territory, who has been purchasing books for the Government library, and who confined his purchases to Roman Catholic works, only.

THE Red Bank, New Jersey, *Register,* in vigorously opposing the enforcement of Sunday laws, says that there should be no such laws, and boasts that while in Red Bank there is an utter disregard of Sunday laws, yet the “town has the reputation of being the quietest and best ordered in the State,” and, “unlike every other town in the county of Monmouth, there is no illegal liquor selling.”

MINISTER’S wife (Sunday morning)— “Is it possible, my dear, that after all you have said about Sunday newspapers, you are reading one?”

Minister (very much hurt)—”You ought to know me better than that, Maria; this is last evening’s paper.”—*The Epoch.*

We presume that this minister was read ing that great exponent of moral ideas, published in this city, which demands rigid Sunday laws, advertises Sunday excursions, and which, while denouncing Sunday papers as demoralizing, suggests that the columns of its Saturday evening edition always contain matter suitable for Sunday reading.

THE *Christian Statesman*, of the 4th inst., has quite a lengthy criticism of Senator Blackburn’s eulogy upon the late Senator Beck, because in making that eulogy Senator Blackburn uttered sentiments which are not, in the opinion of the *Statesman*, in harmony with the teaching of the Christian religion. The *Statesman* does not question the right of Senator Blackburn to hold whatever religious views that may seem to him good, but it challenges his right to air them as a representative of a “people who are overwhelmingly Christian.” And yet this is just the authority that the National Reformers are proposing to give to Congress and to the courts. They propose to recognize Christianity as the religion of this Nation, and then in their own words they must either have a standard of Christianity or else admit anything which claims to be Christianity. But who will make this standard of religion? Evidently just such men as Senator Blackburn, a man who, though an honest man as the world goes, and an able legislator, knows little more of what Christianity really is, than a Hottentot does of calculus. The *Statesman* ought not to object to a little of its own medicine, as a foretaste of what may be in the future.

THE *Churchman,* of this city, closes a careful review of the debate upon the bill to enlarge the appropriation for the Roman Catholic Bureau of Education, by calling on all Protestant societies receiving Government aid, to purge themselves in this matter by refusing any longer to participate, and says: “As it is to-day, by reason of participation, eyes are blinded and lips are dumb in the presence of wrong, and a department of the National Government made subservient to the Roman hierarchy.” THE AMERICAN SENTINEL made the same suggestion some weeks ago, but, so far as we know, it has not been adopted, and we look for no better result from the good advice given by the *Churchman.*

REV. J. D. GILLIAN, Secretary of the Utah Mission of the Methodist Episcopal Church, says:—

> The devotees of no faction are so heartlessly cruel as those of a false religion. Mohammed’s scheme to convert the world with the sword is but the common index to the character of them who are zealously wrong. “By their fruits ye shall know them.” Catholicism of the Middle Ages illustrates the fact of the same possibility existing under the guise of Christianity. Intolerance is the first sign of the fanatic.

To “convert by the sword” is simply to “convert” by force; the same is true of “converting” by civil law; and yet many who can plainly see the iniquity of the former, can see no impropriety in the latter. And why not?—simply because the law is *their* weapon, whereas the sword was wielded by others. Nevertheless, in condemning the sword they condemn force, and in condemning force they unwittingly condemn their own appeal to civil law.

A CORRESPONDENT of the *Voice,* writing from Nebraska, says that he thinks that Prohibitionists are treading on dangerous ground when they “make an exception, in prohibitory laws, of wines used for ‘sacramental’ purposes.” He does not see “how any Christian Prohibitionist can propose or advocate alcoholic liquor for sacramental purposes.” To this the *Voice *replies that it does not advocate the use of alcoholic wine in the communion. “We simply say that it is not the province of *legislators* to decide whether or not the sacramental wine should be fermented. A law which prohibited the manufacture of fermented wines for sacramental purposes would go beyond the proper province of law, and cause many sincere Christians either to violate the law or to violate what *they believe* to be the injunction of Christ. There is no necessity for that.” This is a serious question, and should give pause to some of the ultra-Prohibitionists who want to enforce upon everybody their ideas not only of temperance, but of religion as well. Even the *Voice* should pause long enough to answer candidly, whether some of the legislation which it advocates would not interfere quite as seriously with religious liberty as would the prohibition of fermented wine in the communion.

THE *World* publishes an interview with a clergyman, whose name it does not give, and prefaces it with this explanation:—

> He said, at the outset, that his only object was to correct some popular errors as to the observance of Sunday in Biblical times, and to show exactly how the matter was then regarded.

Then follows an account of Christ’s doings upon the Sabbath, and even Nehemiah’s words concerning the Sabbath, (Neh. 8:10), are quoted to show how Sunday was observed in Bible times. It would be just as appropriate to quote Herodotus, to show how the Egyptians celebrated the Fourth of July. It actually seems that even a great many newspaper men don’t know that Sunday is not the day called “the Sabbath” in the Scriptures.

GERMANY is not only a “Christian country,” but it is a Protestant country, and religion is regularly taught in all the public schools, yet D. Adolf Harnack, one of the most prominent theologians of Germany, declares that if the Lutheran Church is not to fall in ruins altogether, she “must change her Confession, her style of sermons, and her teachings, not according to the wishes of the day, but according to the indisputable knowledge we have gained.” Infidelity seems to be rapidly on the increase, and the law is vainly invoked to stay the rising tide of unbelief. This proves nothing against Christianity, but it is another demonstration of the utter impotency of a State religion, either to give or to conserve a proper moral tone in a people. [305]
