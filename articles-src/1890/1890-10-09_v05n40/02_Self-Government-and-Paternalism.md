A CELEBRATED European nobleman says: "The Americans have the best Government, because they are scarcely aware that they have any Government at all." Commenting upon this, the *Christian Advocate* says: "When the inhabitants of a country become able to govern themselves they need no other Government. Without self-control among the citizens freedom is impossible." This is true; but so-called National Reform, which is more or less in favor with the *Advocate,* is not calculated to develop self-control. National Reform is paternalism, and paternalism in government is utterly destructive of self- government.
