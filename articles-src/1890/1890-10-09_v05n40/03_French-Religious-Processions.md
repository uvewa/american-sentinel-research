THE French are noted for going to extremes. In that country, Catholics are now forbidden to walk in procession on Corpus Christi. *L'Univers* says they may blame themselves for it. It further says: "We are Catholics, and the vast majority of the French people are Catholics, Our God claims to show his universal sovereignty in the streets once a year. It is his right, and our right. We ask no one to join in our peaceful procession, neither the Jew who crucified him, nor the atheist who denies him. We respect their liberty, but we want them also to respect ours." It is possible that there is some justification for such a prohibition, but we can scarcely imagine what it would be. To us it would seem that the forbidding of religious processions, is an exhibition of intolerance, unworthy the officers of a great government. If France fears a procession of Roman Catholics she must indeed be in a sad state.
