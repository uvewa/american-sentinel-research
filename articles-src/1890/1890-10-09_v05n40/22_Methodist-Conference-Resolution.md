THE Elkhorn Valley District Methodist Episcopal Conference in session at Oakdale, Nebraska, August 19 and 20, adopted the following resolution:—

> *Resolved,* That we, the members of the Elkhorn Valley District Conference, have learned with regret that within the last five years the Government of the United States has appropriated over two millions of dollars for the support of sectarian and denominational schools, thereby connecting Church and State. This we deem unjust and unlawful, and we as Christian workers in the cause of Christ deem these demands of some of the churches for appropriations, and the acceptance of the same, contrary to the teachings of Christ, our Lord, and the genius of our Government.

This is a step in the right direction. Now if the whole Methodist body would take this matter up, and pass a similar resolution, and then refund to the Government the $18,825 that they received for the years, 1889, 1890, and 1891, we might hope to see a radical reform.
