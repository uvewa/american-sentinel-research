THE *Convention Reporter*, a new monthly paper, is the organ of the Sixth District of the American Sabbath Union, embracing Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Rev. James P. Mills, M. A., District Secretary, is editor and publisher. The *Evangel of Rest*, issued monthly at Colfax, Iowa, under the management of Rev. Charles R. Hunt, State Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, is another paper the mission of which is to mold public opinion in favor of Sunday laws. It seems to be the settled policy of the so-called Sabbath Union to multiply papers in advocacy of the objects of the society.
