# "Songs of Freedom."

## Premium Poems

IN the interest of the Religious Liberty work a collection of songs is being prepared under the above title, to be issued in December, 1890. The collection will comprise songs on four divisions of the subject, covering in sentiment the motto, "for God, for home, and native land," as follows:—

1. "For God."—Songs setting forth the *moral* rights of citizens to freedom of action, either to worship or not to worship, referring to Bible examples of subjection but non-obedience to "the powers that be."

2. "For Home."—Songs of a pathetic nature, relating to the social phase of the question, introducing recent prison experiences in the South, drawing on the sufferings of the Dark Ages, and alluding to the probable future if Church and State are again united.

3. "For native Land."—Patriotic songs in praise of our country's liberal Constitution, the freedom of the past, the honors of the present, and loyal wishes for its future.

4. Songs which will arraign the arguments of the so-called National Reformers, showing in a kind but pointed manner that they are inconsistent, contrary to the Bible, subversive of liberty, and fatal to the home.

## A $20 Premium

Is hereby offered for four best poems,— one on each of the above topics; $15 for the best poem on any three of them; $10 for the best poem on any two; and $5 for the best of any one of the four topics.

In length the poem must not exceed five 4-line, or four 8-line stanzas, chorus added, and must be forwarded to the National Religious Liberty Association, Battle Creek, Michigan, before November 10, 1890.

A competent committee appointed by the National Religious Liberty Association, will judge the poems, all of which shall have been previously copied in the handwriting of one person, who shall not be a member of the examining committee, and who shall be the only person knowing the origin of the poems.

All poems sent in, as far as suitable, will be set to music, as well as those taking the premium, and will appear in the forthcoming collection, "Songs of Freedom."

The Association also requests that anything already in print on these subjects, either with or without music, be forwarded for use in the collection, provided it has merit.
