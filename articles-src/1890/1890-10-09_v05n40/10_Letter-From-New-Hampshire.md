# Letter From New Hampshire.

> Keene, N. H., Sept. 8, 1890.

EDITORS AMERICAN SENTINEL—D*ear Sirs:* Through your courtesy, or that of some mindful friend, I have received several copies of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL.

Each succeeding number has but confirmed the good opinion I had of it from the first. It is indeed a tower of strength—a veritable Samson demolishing the pillars and supports of both arrogance and ignorance, as manifested through sectarian bigotry. I wish it continued, and enclose a year’s subscription, one dollar, therefor.

I sent for and obtained, of you, some weeks ago, “The National Sunday Law,” which, for sound argument and logic, backed by historical and other facts, is unequalled by anything bearing on the subject, that has come to me. The efforts of Senator Blair to promote temperance and educational interests, apart from sectarian influences, are to be commended. But that he should be influenced to oppose constitutional liberties, which he was chosen to protect and maintain, is not only a matter of surprise to many of his former supporters, but to all whose sense of honor and justice is superior to their desire to bring others to their standard of thought and action.

The attempt to hoodwink the public into the belief that the Sunday-rest bill is secular in its intent and object, is a subterfuge too transparent to mislead any but those whose mental ability is too weak to distinguish between right and foul injustice, or those ever ready to accept the religious tenets of their spiritual teachers without examination.

Force bills, or measures, may be allowable in some directions, but never in denying the right of conscience in matters of religious beliefs or Sabbath observances. It was in view of the intolerance of the church, of its “history traced in blood”—disgraceful to the lowest order of barbarians—that the framers of our Government wisely ordained that Church and State should be widely separated. And it is indeed a matter of surprise that in this progressive day and age, there should be found in our national councils, men so unmindful of the rights of the people they were chosen to protect, as to thus lend their influence to weaken and abrogate the safeguards of our constitutional rights and liberties.IRA W. RUSSELL.

CHRISTIANITY and Churchism are two very different things. Christianity is a scheme of virtue and benevolence for the elevation of mankind. Churchism is a scheme of churchmen for power, plunder, and persecution. Our fathers utterly repudiated Churchism, refusing it either power or money; but said nothing of religion proper. The Churches of Rome, Russia, England, Turkey, and Mormondom are as far from Christ as day from night. In the United States is the only true Church with power to persuade; but none to tax, persecute, curse, or injure. Our fathers placed it just where it should be.—*Political Record, San Francisco, Cal*.

“HAS civil government,” inquires the *Orleans Herald,* “any right to administer divine law?” Certainly not; for civil government to attempt such a thing would be to put itself in the place of God, and destroy individual responsibility to God. [302]
