# N. R. L. A. Statistics.

THE following statistics, of the National Religious Liberty Association, are of interest: Organized July 21, 1889, with an enrollment of 110, its membership has increased regularly and rapidly, 439 new names being the record for last July. Vice-presidents, secretaries, and press agents in the different States number seventy-five; local press agents, 600. During the year, the Association has secured the publication of general articles, and reports of persecution of its members in Tennessee and Georgia, in the leading papers of the country, and in hundreds of local papers. These articles and accounts have drawn out numerous editorials in defense of the principles of Religious Liberty, and favorable to the work of the Association. By this means the Association has become favorably known to the public. One million, six hundred and eighty-three thousand, three hundred and ninety-one pages of literature have been printed and circulated in the interest of Religious Liberty. Lectures have been delivered, and reported in the newspapers in the several States. Its members have appeared before both national and State legislatures, and their efforts have been crowned with marked success. Over $1,000 has been expended in the Southern field, in defense of persecuted members, and $2,000 more in the printing and circulation of literature.

During the coming year the Association will publish a book of several hundred pages, entitled, “American State Papers,” —a compendium of congressional and judicial action relative to Sunday legislation. This work will be placed in the hands of congressmen, judges, lawyers, etc. Another work will be prepared with particular reference to use in State legislatures. The Society will also carry the case of R. M. King before the United States District Court, and possibly before the Supreme Court of the Nation. Meanwhile, its regular line of work will not be intermitted.

This is a showing which cannot fail to interest and encourage all members of the Association, and many others to whose notice it will be brought. A greater work is before it the coming year, which calls for the enthusiastic work of the friends of Religious Liberty, in adding to its numbers, influence, and financial strength.
