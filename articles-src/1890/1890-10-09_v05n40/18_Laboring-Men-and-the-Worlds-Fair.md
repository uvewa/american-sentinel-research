NEARLY every church society, and the Prohibitionists, have petitioned the management of the Columbian Exposition not to open their gates on the Sabbath day.

Miss Frances E. Willard has been interviewed concerning the Columbian Exposition. As she may be assumed to speak for a considerable body of her sex her opinions are of some importance. Miss Willard's views cover a large scope. She says the Woman's Christian Temperance Union will oppose, in the interest "of workingmen as well as of Christians," the opening of the Exposition, Sundays.

It is more singular, however, that the temperance ladies should undertake the cruel and oppressive business of closing the Exposition, Sundays. Miss Willard's classification of workingmen and Christians into mutually exclusive groups seems somewhat fantastic, yet may be erroneous; but in the interest of neither can the Exposition be closed Sundays. There are Christians, of course, whose easy position in life will make it agreeable for them to visit the Exposition mornings of the week days. In the Paris Exposition a double admission fee was charged between 8 and 10 in the morning, so as to enable persons desirous of avoiding crowds to have a comfortable time within the buildings and grounds. Avoiding crowds means, under such circumstances, avoiding contact with common people. It might be a good idea for the directors to charge double admission week mornings during the corresponding hours. Then Christians who abhor attendance Sundays might go, and not come in contact with working men and their families.

Employers will not give holidays with pay. The great majority of women cannot afford to lose a day's pay. Their wage is a pittance. Will the women of the Temperance Union undertake to make up their loss if they take a day off now and then without pay? Will the employers of these women, many of whom are contract manufacturers for wholesale houses, be amiable about giving them days off?— *Lincoln *(*Neb.*)* News. *[319-320]
