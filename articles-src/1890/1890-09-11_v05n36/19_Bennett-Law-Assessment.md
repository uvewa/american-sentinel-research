IT is evident that the friends of the law do not find in the Republican indorsement all that they would wish to find; but it is pretty certain that there is in it all that there ought to be. As we remarked in our note last week, the law as it stands is unworthy the support of either of the great parties, and we are glad to know that it has been *fully* indorsed by neither party. The State will have very little trouble in guaranteeing to all children sufficient instruction in the English language to enable them to speak and write it. Every foreigner desires his child to have a knowledge of the language of the country, and every child desires such a knowledge for himself; and the fear that any considerable number of children, in any part of this country, will fail to secure the instruction necessary to enable them to read and write English, is practically groundless. The anti-foreign sentiment which is being so assiduously cultivated in certain quarters, would better be directed against foreign paternalism in government, than against the use of foreign languages in our schools. English, which is already the language of commerce in all nations, and which bids fair to supplant the French as the language of diplomacy, will certainly never fall into disuse in any part of this country.
