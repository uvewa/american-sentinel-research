MR. JOHN N. STEARNS, Corresponding Secretary of the National Temperance Society, has transmitted to the American Sabbath Union the following resolution, adopted at a regular meeting of the Board of Managers of the Society:—

> *Resolved*, That the Board of Managers of the National Temperance Society, in behalf of its membership throughout the Nation, earnestly protests against the opening of the World's Fair on the Sabbath day.

This strikes us as being a little out of the line of the legitimate business of the National Temperance Society. If the managers want to throw their influence in favor of Sunday closing of the Exposition, they should do it on their own responsibility; they have, no right to commit the Society upon such a question.
