# Fined Again.

R. M. KING, of Dyer County, Tennessee, whose case for Sunday-breaking has been appealed to the United States Court, was arrested the third time, on the nineteenth of last June, and brought before the justice court. Of this occasion, he writes:—

> On the fifteenth of June, I went out in the morning, and hoed six rows of potatoes; worked just about an hour, and then went to hear the Methodist minister preach. There was a State warrant taken out for me the next day for Sabbath-breaking, and I was arrested on the nineteenth, and taken before Squire Barker, tried, found guilty, and fined $5 and costs, whole amount $6.90.

> There was a man in the same neighborhood who cut wheat with a binder, on the same day, and worked the necessary hands to shock it, but there was no complaint made of his breaking the Sabbath. He was not a church member.
Of all the prosecutions for Sunday breaking in Dyer County, of which there has been a considerable number, in the past eighteen months, not one arrest has been made outside the number of those who are acknowledged conscientious Christian men, but who differ with the established religion of Tennessee, in that they read the fourth commandment, “The seventhday is the Sabbath,” and those who enacted the religious laws of Tennessee read it “The First day is the Sabbath.” Those who acknowledge no allegiance to the divine command have so far been absolved from all allegiance to the human Sunday law. This clearly marks the spirit of persecution from which these prosecutions arise.

A CIRCULAR letter has been issued by the Sunday Association of Illinois, to churches, trade and labor Unions and other associations, in which they ask all ecclesiastical and beneficial organizations to adopt a set of resolutions, asking Congress to pass the National Sunday-rest bill; the managers of the World’s Fair to close its gates on Sunday; the pastors, church clerks, and secretaries of various ecclesiastical, ethical, or beneficial societies, to co-operate with the Sunday associations in the different States to secure Sunday legislation; and finally urging the Evangelical Alliance to give its influence especially to the furtherance of the enforcement of Sunday observance and in securing the united effort of all religious bodies to this end, with particular reference to the Sunday-rest bill and Sunday observance at the World’s Fair.

Thus the work of organization for the promotion of religious legislation goes steadily on, and the plans by which it is intended to accomplish the ends expected are by no means circumscribed, but are enlarged to take advantage of the organized assistance of every society or association of men, women, or children which it is possible to enlist among the ranks of the “National Reform Soldiery,” which, Miss Willard says, “goes ‘marching as for war ’ in behalf of a national Christianity.”

THE movement for the promotion and enforcement of the observance of Sunday as a day of rest, is making rapid strides in Europe, as is shown by the following Paris dispatch to the London *Daily News:—*

A short time ago MM. Jules Simon, Leon Say, and Cheysson, in the name of the League for the Promotion of Sunday Rest for Working People, wrote to the Minister of Public Works, to assist them in an appeal to the railway companies. They did not ask him to use any compulsion, but simply to show himself favorable to the objects of the League, in asking the companies how they might possibly meet them, and whether it would not be possible to suspend, wholly or partially, goods traffic on Sunday. M. Yvest Guyot, in answer states that he has submitted the application of the League to the railway companies, in the hope that they would so arrange the regulations for goods traffic as to be able to grant one day in seven, or at least a part of one to those employed. [271-272]

THE papers of Finland have received notice from the Russian authorities that advocating the people’s rights, even in the most sober manner, must stop. The Czar is determined to be a “father” to his people, even if he has to banish half of them to compel the other half to adopt the “true religion” and correct political views. The Government of Russia is thoroughly paternal.

THE *World* asks: “How long will the anachronism and injustice continue which compel New Yorkers to violate some statute in order to get needed and innocent recreation on Sunday?” It will continue as long as the State attempts to compel people who have not a religious regard for Sunday to act as though they had. As it stands, the law is utterly useless; and serves only to breed contempt for all law.

A RECENT London dispatch says:—

> The exaction of tithes for the support of the Established Church continues to excite much opposition in Wales, and at a sale under distraint in Montgomeryshire a few days ago, the chief constable was struck, and the auctioneer repeatedly kicked by a mob. The sale, however, was persisted in, and the amount distrained for recovered.

Our English cousins ought to learn that there is a better way of getting money for the support of churches than by direct tax: it is by exempting church property from taxation, and by appropriating public money for the support of denominational schools. The result is the same, and ugly scenes are avoided.

THE *Christian Advocate*, of this city, has the following:—

> By whom are the saloons supported? Not by the women; not by the ministers and teachers; not by the substantial business men and thriving manufacturers. The Rev. H. W. Bennett, of Columbus, Ohio, says that on Saturday evening careful watch was kept for one hour over five saloons in that city, during which time 640 persons entered, 554 of whom were young men. That hour and that night may be a fair sample, and that city quite like other cities. The young men who work in the mills and shops, and the young men who do not work, support the saloons.

The question which this suggests to our minds, is, Would a Sunday-closing law prevent this? The answer must clearly be in the negative. And yet we are gravely told that more liquor is sold on Sunday than upon any other day. If the demand for Sunday-closing was made broad enough to cover all the time from Saturday noon till Monday morning, there would be a little more consistency in parading it as a temperance measure. As it is, the most that can be said for it is that it is probably of about as much value., from a prohibition standpoint, as high license, unless, as is the case in this city, corrupt police captains make it a source of revenue by permitting, for a money consideration, a side-door business on Sunday.

COMMENTING upon an imperial ukase recently issued, forbidding further action by Protestant missionaries, especially in western Russia, under the penalty of expulsion from the empire, the *Mail and Express* says:—

> This is in perfect keeping with the treatment which the Hebrews are now receiving in the same country; and it is in harmony with the policy which is crushing out Lutheranism and German speech in the Baltic provinces. The Russian Government seems resolved to make an end of all race, religious, and lingual differences within the limits of the empire. It is a policy which has its merits; but it is very cruel. It can be carried out only in Russia.

The *Mail and Express* is about the last paper that ought to find any fault with the Czar for any efforts which he may make to put an end to race, religious, and lingual differences in his empire, for that is practically what it advocates doing in this country. Such a policy is, however, neither more meritorious nor less cruel in America, than in Russia.

“FOR several years,” says an exchange, “the local bands have given concerts at Seaside, and Washington parks, at Bridgeport, Conn., on Wednesday and Saturday evenings. It is now proposed, by the Wheeler Wilson band, to give Sunday afternoon concerts, at Seaside park, and such a concert is announced for next Sunday. Business men and working people are largely in favor of these concerts, but at the morning prayer-meeting on Saturday, of church people, a resolution was adopted protesting against a profanation of the Sabbath, and agreeing to use all means within their power to prevent the concert from being given.”

This does not agree very well with the claim that is made that they want the State to enforce only a “civil Sabbath.” Certainly it requires no more work to render ordinary music, than it does to render sacred music. How comes it then that in order to have a “civil Sabbath” these bands must be prohibited from playing while the church choirs are not interfered with? There is no avoiding the conclusion that it is not the amount of work involved, but the fact that the church music is religious, while the music of the bands is secular.

METHODIST periodicals are discussing the growing tendency of the clergymen of that denomination to make their annual and general conferences scenes of wirepulling and log-rolling, that turn them into veritable political caucuses and conventions. Commenting upon this fact, a secular paper remarks that “the methods of the brethren at the last conference, when the ballot box was ‘stuffed ’ during the exciting race of the various candidates for bishoprics, were ominous of degeneration. On several ballots, the number of votes found by the tellers was in excess of the whole number of legal voters in the conference, much to the scandal of the devout.” But sad as such things are, we may expect them to become more and more common, as the churches become more and more involved in political matters.

W. H. CHANDLER, Assistant State Superintendent of Public Instruction, of Wisconsin, is credited with the following, concerning the Bennett Law:—

> I believe to-day as I have all along, and just as I told Governor Hoard, when the bill was passed. The Bennett Law is an injudicious piece of legislation, and one that is unnecessary in Wisconsin. I am not a compulsory educationalist; it is unnecessary, for the reason that it is the first desire of everyone to become familiar with the language of the country, and to secure an education in the English language. Of course, the advocates of the law bring forward a few persons who cannot speak English, but they are exceptional cases, and will exist, and cannot help existing, under almost any circumstances. . . . The law is objectionable not only to Democrats but to prominent Republicans also. There will be an awakening of sentiment at the State convention, that will compel a compromise and modification of the law, and it will be so fixed that all objectionable features will be eliminated. But the law was unnecessary and injudicious, and could some persons have foreseen the future, the bill would never have become a law.

We have said in substance, more than once, that a law compelling the learning of English is entirely unnecessary in this country, since self-interest leads all to desire a knowledge of the language of the country. Such measures as the Bennett Law are not only unnecessary, but they are subversive of that liberty which has always been the boast of this country.
