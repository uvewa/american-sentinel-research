THE Czar of Russia, who is the head of the Greek Church, demands that the Pope shall address him as an equal, which the Pope refuses to do. A Western paper thinks that the Pope has the better claim to pre-eminence, since he is the bigger humbug. But to us this seems like "snap judgment," for since each, being but a man, claims to be the head of "the only true church," how can the claim of one be any more preposterous than that of the other?
