THE *Mail and Express* is very much concerned about a union of Church and State in Turkey. In its issue of August 5, it says:—

> The dangers and evils that are inherent in a union of Church and State, have been revealed in the riots in Constantinople against the Armenian Patriarch, which compelled his resignation. The Patriarch's conduct shows that he would have encountered no violent opposition had he held merely his ecclesiastical position, free from entanglements with the Turkish Government. . . .

> It was as creditable to the Patriarch that he was urged to reconsider his resignation, as it was that he refused any longer to occupy the position in which he was incapable of protecting his people and yet subject to violent and irrational popular demonstrations, because he was powerless for good.
> Could there be a more glaring illustration of the folly and injustice and outright wickedness of the union of Church and State, which the ambitious and scheming Roman Catholic hierarchy would be glad to see consummated in this country?
All that the *Mail and Express* says of a union of Church and State is true; but Romanists are not alone in working for such a union in this country. Many so-called Protestants are quite as much at fault as are the Romanists. Indeed the only difference between them is, that, while the Catholics want government pap for Romanists, Protestants want it for the upbuilding of Protestantism.
