LAST week we stated in a last-page note, that the Republicans of Wisconsin had declared in favor of the Bennett law; but we had not, at the time of making up our paper, seen a copy of the platform adopted by the convention which renominated Governor Hoard, and we find that we were misled by telegraphic statements, sent out evidently by those whose wish was father to their statements. That part of the Wisconsin Republican platform relating to the Bennett law, is as follows:—

> The Republican party in convention assembled, declares its devotion to the common school as the chief factor in the education of the people, and pledges itself to support, strengthen and defend it. It recognizes as valuable auxiliaries in the work of public education the private and parochial schools, supported without aid from public funds, and disclaims absolutely any purpose whatever to interfere in any manner with such schools, either as to their terms, government, or branches to be taught therein.

> We affirm the right and duty of the State to enact laws that will guarantee to all children sufficient instruction in the legal language of the State to enable them to read and write the same. We believe that the compulsory education law passed by the last Legislature is wise and humane in all its essential purposes, and we are opposed to its repeal, *but at the same time we assert that the parent or guardian has the right to select the time of year and the place, whether public or private, and wherever located, in which his child or ward shall receive instruction, and we pledge ourselves to modify the existing law so that it shall conform to the foregoing declarations.*
> We further believe that all children between the ages of seven and fourteen years should be protected by appropriate legislation from the evils, physical and mental, arising from their employment in factories and similar places of work, and that adequate provision should be made for the care of children incorrigibly truant.
> We are unalterably opposed to any union of Church and State, and will resist any attempt upon the part of either to invade the dominion of the other. We repudiate as a gross misrepresentation of our purposes the suggestion, come whence it may, that we will in any manner invade the dominion of conscience and trample upon parental rights or religious liberty. Our only purpose in respect to the educational policy of the State is to secure to all children within its borders, at the earliest practicable age, proper equipment for the discharge of the ordinary duties of citizenship, and to this end, alike important to the State, to the children, and to the parents of the children, we invite the co-operation and aid of all broad-minded and patriotic people.
This, we take it, comes far short of the indorsement desired by the ultra friends of the Bennett law. *America* says of it:—

> While this is not precisely a straddle, it is a campaign manifesto that does not seem to stand squarely on the ground which is expected to witness the triumph of true Americanism in domestic legislation.
