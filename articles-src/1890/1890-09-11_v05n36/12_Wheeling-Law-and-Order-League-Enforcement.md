THE advice of the Sunday Union in respect to the establishment of Law and Order Leagues throughout the country, for the enforcement of Sunday laws, has taken root, and in several localities has already reached the fruit-bearing period. A prominent instance, which the daily press is now noticing, occurs in Wheeling, West Virginia, where the League has undertaken to enforce the Sunday laws to the letter. A "special" says that on Sunday, August 31, it was impossible to purchase anything in Wheeling, other than necessary medicines, and mentions it as the intention of the League to stop the publication of the Sunday papers.

The dispatch declares, however, that "owing to the absurdly extreme measures taken, there has been a revulsion of feeling throughout the city."

It is noticeable that the press comments do not take exception to the principle involved, but only criticise the action taken by the League as extreme and beyond what public opinion will uphold.

These organizations will continue to push the enforcement of religious laws and city ordinances to the farthest limit in which they can secure the application of the penalties attached, until at last, and not far in the future, this country will find itself under the rule of a religious oligarchy. The Religious Liberty Association was organized none too soon.
