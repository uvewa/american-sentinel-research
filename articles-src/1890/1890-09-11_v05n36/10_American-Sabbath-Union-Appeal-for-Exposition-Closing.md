"THE American Sabbath Union," says the *Pearl of Days,* "has presented an earnest appeal to the Commissioners of the World's Columbian Exposition to be held in Chicago, asking them to decide that the Exposition shall be closed on Sundays. It is understood that the Commissioners will meet in Chicago, on October 7. The officers of the Union, in making this appeal, ask the co-operation of all the friends of the Sabbath throughout the land."
