# A Representative National Reformer Defines His Position.

WE are in receipt of the following note from Oakland, California, under date of August 6:—

> EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL, *Dear Sir:* I see you have copied the *Signs of the Times* criticism of my article, or letter, anent the action of the California Prohibition Convention in reference to the Sabbath, or Sunday law. I have this day written for the *Signs of the Times* a reply, or defense of myself. If it should appear in the *Signs,* as I hope it will next week, I ask that you copy it in THE AMERICAN SENTINEL that your readers may have both sides.

> Yours respectfully.
> N. R. JOHNSTON.
We cheerfully comply with Mr. Johnston's request to publish his "defense," which we give as follows, just as it appeared in our Oakland contemporary:—

> EDITOR SIGNS OF THE TIMES: AS copied in THE AMERICAN SENTINEL of July 31, I have this day read your criticism of my letter in the *Christian Statesman,* of May 15. Will you admit a few lines in my own defense? For I think you misunderstand me. I am sure your readers will if they do not read my letter in the *Statesman.*

> 1. I do not believe in a "civil Sabbath" in the sense in which you use the words. I never have said that a "civil Sabbath" is all that I favor. I differ entirely from the majority of the California people, who ask a Sunday law merely as a police or sanitary regulation. From the first of Rev. Mr. Crafts's coming here, and all the time, I have most decidedly objected to his theory of a "civil Sunday." In the *Christian Statesman* I wrote against it; and it was because of my objection to the "civil Sunday" that I wrote what I did about the action of the State Prohibition Convention. I totally reject the secular theory of government and of education alike. Others wish only a "civil Sunday;" I wish "the Sabbath of the Lord," our God the Institutor of it.
> 2. The only authority we have for the observance of a Sabbath—the only power that has any right to require a seventh portion of time to be observed as sacred to rest and to worship, whether it be a seventh-day or a first-day Sabbath—is the divine [284] Law-giver, whose will is declared in the law of the fourth commandment. Neither Church nor State has any right to make a law about a Sabbath. "The Sabbath was made [*i. e.*, appointed] for man." God appointed it. Governments or legislatures have no power except to recognize it as God's law, binding upon the people, and to see that the law which forbids work, be not trampled underfoot by open transgressors.
> 3. God is the Author of all moral law. He is the source of all authority. "There is no power but of God." Governments may only find out law, the divine law, and accept and codify it as the law by which the people must be governed. Especially do governments have nothing to do in legislation in the department of religion. Government's only sphere is in civil matters.
> 4. The law of the fourth commandment is partly religious and partly civil. It commands religious duties: it also commands civil duties. "In it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, . . . nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy man-servant and thy maid-servant may rest as well as thou." That is *civil* law. Government should protect men in the enjoyment of their rights. The right to rest as God requires, belongs to the servant. If the master does not grant the right to an employe, he is a transgressor of law. Governments must protect the wronged. God requires it. Government is his agent. Thus government may legislate as to the enforcement of God's civil law for the protection of men in the enjoyment of God-given rights. Thus far I am in favor of a "civil Sabbath." Am I understood?
> 5. "Thou shalt not steal" is a moral, civil law. Governments have no power to either reject it or modify it. The same is true of the fourth commandment. Except by moral restraints or motives the Church has no power to prevent work on the Sabbath. But a law without a penalty is no law at all. Therefore, civil government is the only and the proper power to punish the open transgression of God's civil law. Thus far I am in favor of a civil Sabbath law. But remember that the permission or obligation to legislate about Sabbath observance is derived wholly from God. Men or governments have no such authority. The religious obligation is the only one existing; *i. e.*, we should have Sabbath laws only because God requires them and for man's good. And the principle I advocate is applicable whether the first or the seventh day should be kept holy. Which is the true Sabbath is not the question here and now. I honor the convictions of those who conscientiously believe in the seventhday Sabbath; but I beg leave to say that I do not believe in "only a civil Sabbath." I am not in favor of "only a civil Sunday law." I prefer the fourth commandment; and the people, the Church, and the State that permit it to be trampled underfoot by lawless desecrators are false to God and to humanity.
> Yours for the truth and the right.
> N. R. JOHNSTON.
Having given place to Mr. Johnston's letter, we deem it only right that our readers should have also the reply made by the *Signs of the Times*, which is as follows:—

We give place to the above letter of explanation, not alone as an act of courtesy to a very estimable gentleman, with whom we enjoy a pleasant acquaintance, but also for the special benefit of the readers of the *Signs of the Times.* Mr. Johnston is an honored member of the National Reform Association. He was secretary of one of the early national conventions of that organization, and is a regular contributor to the *Christian Statesman. *Therefore when we read a statement from him, we feel that we read the thoughts of the National Reform Association. We shall doubtless have occasion to make frequent reference to that body in the future, and- those of our readers who treasure up this letter will know, as well as any one can know, what its principles are on the Sunday question. We will now offer a few words of comment on the letter, section by section.

1. We wish that all Sunday-law people stood where Mr. Johnston does, and would as frankly avow their belief in, and desire for, a law from a religious standpoint. We are sure that this is where they all stand, in heart; but repeated defeats on that line have taught many to conceal their real sentiments by pleading for a merely "civil Sunday." With the exception of the statement, "I totally reject the secular theory of government and of education alike," there is nothing in section 1 that we could not heartily second. We also "wish the Sabbath of the Lord our God," not, however, enforced by civil authority.

But by the above phrase, Mr. Johnston means Sunday, which is not the Sabbath of the Lord our God. "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." Ex. 20:10. It was such as late as the time when Christ was on earth, and when the New Testament was written. See Mark 2:23-28. If the Lord has changed the day of his Sabbath, it has been done since his revelation was given to man, and we should like to know where the record of the change is, and to whom he committed it.

2. With the exception of the last sentence, we most emphatically say, "Good!" to section 2. But to the statement that it is the province of legislatures to recognize God's law as binding on the people, and to see that it is not trampled underfoot, we offer a most emphatic protest. That would be a union of Church and State, for it is simply a partnership between God and the State, by the terms of which the Lord is to enact the laws, and the State is to enforce them. This is just the same as a partnership in which one party furnishes the capital and the other does the work. God has not relegated to any inferior power the right or authority to enforce his laws. To think that he "that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers," before whom all nations "are as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity" (Isa. 40:22, 17), should intrust the execution of his laws to those same comparatively insignificant creatures, is an insult to common sense, to say nothing of revelation.

It is a misapprehension of the fourth commandment, to assume that it simply forbids *work* on the Sabbath day. Paul says that "the law is spiritual." If it is not spiritual, it is nothing. Just what the fourth commandment does forbid is shown by its Author in Isa. 58:13: "If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable; and shalt honor him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words," etc. Now if civil government takes it upon itself to see that men do not "trample underfoot" the fourth commandment, it must see that they do not speak their own words on the Sabbath day. A difficult task it would be, yet as difficult a task was undertaken by the Inquisition. Only the Inquisition could determine to any degree whatever whom to punish for violation of the fourth commandment .God never established the Inquisition, but a National Reform government could not be carried on without it; therefore God has nothing to do with National Reform.

3. A queer mixture is in this paragraph. Governments have nothing to do with religion, yet they must codify and enforce divine law! Since God is the moral Governor, and human governments are to enforce his decrees, yet are to have nothing to do with religion, we may ask, Whence, then, comes religion? But why should the law of God need to be codified by human legislators? Is it not sufficiently clear and concise? The idea that poor, weak, fallible mortals can codify the laws of the Omnipotent Ruler of the universe, which were spoken by his own voice, and engraved in the flinty rock with his own finger, is too monstrous an assumption to be amusing. To codify is to epitomize; to arrange or systematize; to make an orderly collection or compendium of. It is a long step in advance of having the same thing loosely arranged. Therefore, since the National Reform government would codify the laws of God, it must be a legitimate successor to that power that "opposeth and exalteth itself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped."

4. Yes, you are understood quite well. "The law of the fourth commandment is partly religious and partly civil!" We have often heard this claim made, and now propose to place it by the side of one text of Scripture: "For we know that the law is spiritual." Rom. 7:14. Can you say that, Brother Johnston? or have you information of a later date than Paul's? That cannot be, for he spoke by inspiration that which he had learned from God himself; and God does not change. Facts cannot change. If the law was spiritual in Paul's day, it is spiritual still, not partly spiritual and partly something else. The idea that the moral law is partly civil is a modern invention, conjured up by presumptuous, self-seeking men, as an excuse for their attempt to divide honors with the Almighty. In saying this, we mean no disrespect to Mr. Johnston. Even the Apostle Barnabas was once unsuspectingly carried away by dissimulation.

But, Brother Johnston, you say in paragraph 1, that you don't want a civil Sunday law; you are frank in your avowal of a desire for a Sunday law from a religious standpoint; then why the reference to the supposed civil features of the fourth commandment as an aid to your plea? Why detract from its complete and perfect morality, and make it partly secular, when you don't want a secular Sunday [285] law? We can answer. It is because nobody can argue for Sunday laws without involving himself in hopeless inconsistencies.

If the reference to "gates" in the fourth commandment be construed as referring to city gates, then the whole commandment must be considered as addressed to the government, and not to the individual. But it is actually addressed individually to every man. Each man is to keep the Sabbath; his son and his daughter must likewise keep it; his man-servant and his maid-servant must also keep it; and also the stranger that is within his gates. That is, all who are upon the man's premises must keep the Sabbath, because if they worked, it would be the same as if he worked.

It is true that government must protect a man in the enjoyment of God-given rights; but that does not signify that it must force a man to accept that which he does not regard as a right, but which he thinks is positively wrong. Protection and compulsion are widely different. Government must protect the wronged. If a servant wishes to keep Sunday, and his employer by force and power compels him to work, then he may appeal to the law for protection, and so may any man who is forcibly deprived of his liberty. But we must confess that we have never heard of such a case since the abolition of slavery. In these days when employes strike for the most trivial causes, and almost every laborer belongs to some organization which assumes the right to dictate to the employer just how far he may go in any case, it is sheer nonsense to talk of men being compelled to work on Sunday against their will.

5. In this section we have the climax. "'Thou shalt not steal' is a moral civil law." The Bible knows nothing of any such mongrel. "The law is spiritual." It is wholly spiritual. He who keeps it only outwardly does not keep it at all. Read the Saviour's dissertation on the law, in Matt. 5:19-28, and his denunciation of hypocrites in Matt. 23:25-28. Thousands of men who have never been guilty of any act of which the State could take notice, have lived in daily violation of the eighth commandment, as well as the seventh, and others.

But what shall we say to this: "But a law without a penalty is no law at all. Therefore, civil government is the only and the proper power to punish the open transgression of God's civil law," which is the *moral* law of the ten commandments. God says, "Vengeance is mine; I will repay;" but National Reform says that God hasn't the power, and that if human governments do not administer the penalty, sin must go unpunished. Christ says that God has given the Son authority to execute judgment, and that he will do this when he comes from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire (see John 5:27; 2 Thess. 1:7-9); but National Reform says that human governments must execute judgment now, or else the sinner will go free. Could any worse insult to the majesty of Jehovah be invented? Mr. Johnston is a minister of the gospel, and we know that he is personally devout and reverent; therefore we feel the more astonished that he should champion a cause which puts man above God; yea, which sets man on the throne of judgment, and relegates God to obscurity.

We have studied brevity in noticing these points, for our space is limited; but we trust that all the readers of the *Signs of the Times* can see that opposition to Sunday laws, and to the theory which underlies them, is not simply a matter of protesting against a possible injustice to a few men; it is a religious duty incumbent on every one who has any regard for the honor of God. Human government is secular, and only secular;' that is, it pertains wholly to this world and to worldly affairs. God is the only moral Governor; his government is the only moral government; his law is the only moral law; and it is wholly moral. With it man has nothing to do but to obey it. The duty of the king is identical with that of the humblest subject. Both are alike answerable to God, and to him alone, for violation of his law. So broad are its requirements, that no one can keep them except by the grace of Christ; no one can boast over another; and no one can get beyond simple, personal obedience to it, so that he can act as an overseer to his fellows.

To those who assume to exercise the prerogatives of God, he will say at the last day, "Who hath required this at your hands?" and like the man in the parable, they will be speechless; for "the lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day."
