# Church and State.

IN these days when religious legislation is being pushed in every quarter, the true relation of Church and State cannot be kept too prominently before the people. We are not surprised that zealous churchmembers feel pressed in spirit because of the ungodliness that is sapping the life out of churches, and should be anxious to see something done to stay the tide of worldliness; but we would have them remember that to do a thing which Christ has never authorized, but has forbidden, is as bad as doing nothing. One evil can never be checked by another evil. The following extract from an article in the *Presbyterian Quarterly* for April, 1890, will help some to a clearer idea of what both the Church and the State may, and may not do:—

“From all that has been found in the word of God it will be seen that, under the New Testament dispensation, Church and State are intended by our Saviour to be absolutely separate and distinct. They are different spheres, touching at no point. They contain, to some extent, the same people, and take cognizance of the same sins and duties, under the same moral law, but deal with the people from a different- point of view, with different ends in view. The State seeks temporal ends only, and requires civic duties. The Church seeks moral, eternal salvation. The State uses brute force; the Church, the sword of the Spirit. Incidentally, Church and State render assistance to each other, but they can only do so (lawfully) incidentally. The Church teaches the people morals, and instills submission, while the State affords protection.

To summarize: 1. A foundation principle is that the moral law covers all of man’s original duties, is personal in its application, but requires him to perform each branch of his duty toward its appropriate object. Duties are owed to God, other men, self, the Church, the family, the State, society. The individual owes his duty toward each, and each may hold him bound to perform the part due to itself; the Church may hold him responsible for the part owed to her; the State may hold him responsible for the part due to it, etc., but only God can hold man bound for his whole moral duty.

2. The Church is a spiritual body, seeking spiritual ends, and using spiritual means to accomplish them. Her allegiance is given to Christ, her spiritual Head. She has no lawful connection with any civil government, has no commission to indorse any, nor to support any, nor to destroy any, but is enjoined to teach submission to such as God may set up wherever Christian people live.

3. It is the business of the Church, by her standards and from her pulpits, to seek to declare the whole counsel of God. This will involve the teaching of the moral law in its bearing upon duties owed to God, man, the Church, the State, the family, society, commerce, letters, etc. The Church is to enforce all the moral principles taught in the word of God and all the details therein given.

The Church knows no State, further than to teach the people their duties toward any State which God in his providence may set up, and to see that her people lead exemplary lives in whatsoever positions they may occupy. The State knows no Church as such; she only knows individuals who constitute the State, and she requires of them only civic duties. So long as Church and State keep within their legitimate spheres, there can be no conflict between them.”
