THE *Dial*, of Oakland, California, makes the following excellent point on Mrs. Bateham, of Ohio, who is assisting in the California Sunday campaign:—

> Mrs. Bateham illuminated her speech at the Presbyterian church, Thursday night, by saying that the people of Washington awoke after twenty years, and found that they had no Sabbath law. Dear Mrs Bateham, Sister Bateham, do you not know that you have proved too much? See! *Without any law* the sleepy and highly religious people of old Washington observed the Sabbath well—so well as to stand in the front rank of all Sunday observing cities. If this was the result of having *no Sabbath* laws, why do you complain?

Friend *Dial*, you must not expect Mrs. Bateham to be consistent; but you can depend upon an Oakland audience to appreciate the dilemma in which she has placed herself and the cause which she represents.
