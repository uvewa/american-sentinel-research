# Some Rash Statements Examined.

DR. R. H. MCDONALD, of San Francisco, has sent us a leaflet from which we make a few extracts. Printed on one side in large type is this statement

If the clergy of California would unite in one earnest, determined effort, we would have an effective Sunday law, and there would not be an open saloon in the State by Dec. 31, 1891.

If this is true we cannot help wondering why so much abuse has been heaped upon the Seventh-day people of that State for preventing the passage of a Sunday law, and why they have been accused of joining with saloon keepers to strike down the "Christian Sabbath." Certainly if a Sunday law is really desirable, and the clergy could secure it in so short a time by a determined effort, they ought to blame nobody but themselves if they fail to get such a law. And again, if by a determined effort the clergy could close every saloon in California, before Dec. 31, 1891, they certainly have no room to censure those who simply refuse to assent to a Sunday-closing law, the passage of which would be to say, in effect, that saloons are all right *except on Sunday. *If the outcome of the present agitation in California should be the passage of a Sunday law, while the saloons are still permitted to prey upon the community as in times past, would it not show much more zeal on the part of the clergy in behalf of Sunday than in behalf of temperance?

On the margin of this leaflet is this remarkable statement:—

> There is no instance of a people keeping the Sabbath, as a rest day, who were not free. God has joined liberty with the Sabbath.

Let us see; the Jews kept the Sabbath. From the exode until Saul—about 400 years—they were a free people. But after Saul became king they were no more free than are the subjects of the Czar to-day. The kings of Israel were absolute monarchs, as appears from a number of scriptures. Before Saul was anointed, the Lord commanded Samuel to tell the people just what kind of a government they would have.

> And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked of him a king. And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots. And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots. And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers. And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants. And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants. And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work. He will take the tenth of your sheep; and ye shall be his servants. And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the Lord will not hear you in that day. 1 Sam. 8:10-18.

David and Solomon were wise kings, but like Saul they were absolute rulers. We may judge of the character of at least the latter part of Solomon's reign, from these words of the people to his son, Rehoboam, who succeeded to the throne upon the death of his father:—

> And all the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam saying, Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee. 1 Kings 12:3, 4.

But instead of granting this reasonable request of the people, Rehoboam answered them, saying, "My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke; my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions." 1 Kings 12:14.

And future kings were no better, so far [286] as freedom for the people was concerned. The history of both Judah and Israel is, for the most part, a history of misrule and oppression; and yet the Jews were nominally a Sabbath-keeping people; and during a great part of their history, they certainly kept the Sabbath more strictly than any nation now keeps Sunday. But they were not a free people. This proves nothing against Sabbath-keeping; and these facts are not stated to cast any reflection upon Sabbath observance, but only to show how utterly unfounded is the statement published by Dr. McDonald, that "there is no instance of a people keeping the Sabbath, as a rest day, who were not a free people." The statement is without the least foundation in fact, and like many other goody-goody statements, is made for the purpose of persuading people who have no religious regard for Sunday, to keep it from motives of personal advantage. The only correct motive for Sabbath observance is a sincere desire to obey God; and where this motive is lacking, no law however rigidly enforced, can make a people Sabbathkeepers in any proper sense of the term.C.
