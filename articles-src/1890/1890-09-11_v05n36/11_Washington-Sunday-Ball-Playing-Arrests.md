ON a recent Sunday, a party of young men, of the city of Washington, were playing ball outside of hearing distance from any dwelling, but were arrested by the police, on the strength of the commonlaw decision, recently issued by the Commissioners, that ball-playing on Sunday is contrary to the Christian religion, and that the Christian religion is a part of the common law, and, consequently, of the law of the District of Columbia.

When the case was brought to trial, the Court and prosecuting attorney ignored the legal lore of the Commissioners, and tried the case under an ordinance prohibiting the playing of ball in streets, avenues, and alleys. The counsel for the ball players argued that the law had not been violated, although he attempted to placate the Court by acknowledging that the young men might better have been in church.

The policeman *thought* that they were playing on a line with the extension of Seventeenth street; the Judge therefore held that they were playing in the streets, and imposed a fine of five dollars.

Such things as 'these are sufficient evidence that wherever the authorities are infected with National Reform doctrines, religious regulations will be enforced, even outside of the law. What then will be the condition of affairs when all the religious legislation asked for has been secured?
