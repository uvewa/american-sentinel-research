"MUCH," says the *Christian Advocate*, "is made of the sacrifices which the Christian religion requires. Infidels protest against such a demand as unjust, and merely nominal Christians consider it a great hardship." We suspect that this accounts for the efforts of Sunday-law advocates and other religious legislationists, to secure the passage of laws that will practically eliminate all necessity for sacrifice on the part of those who profess Christianity. The road to life is to be made broad by civil law.
