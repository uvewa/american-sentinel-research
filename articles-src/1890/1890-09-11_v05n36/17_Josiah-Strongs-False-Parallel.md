JOSIAH STRONG, Secretary of the Evangelical Alliance, says:—

> All laws may be said to limit individual liberty, but just laws restrain each in the interest of all; they draw the circumscribing line only where the liberty of one overlaps that of many. Hence, law in a much larger sense, is the guardian of liberty. This is true of our Sabbath laws. Whatever can be said against them, as infringing personal liberty, may be urged with greater force against our common school laws; they rest on the same foundation and are alike pillars of our free institutions.

Is it a sound conclusion that, "this is true of our Sabbath laws," and that "our common school laws rest upon the same foundation"? By school laws, of course, he means those which require attendance upon school for a stated period. Are laws enforcing compulsory attendance upon school, and laws enforcing compulsory observance of Sunday, parallel? They are not. Why not? Because common school education is a secular matter entirely, between the State and the parent and pupil; but Sunday observance would bring in another factor—God. Do the two rest upon the same foundation? They do not, unless the State is God, and God the State. However, that is just the proposition into which the National Reform doctrine invariably resolves itself.
