A CINCINNATI paper well remarks that "it is to *prevent* working people from enjoying themselves on the 'American Sabbath' that all the efforts of the Law and Order Leagues are directed. The Carnegie library in Allegheny City, it has been decided, must be kept closed on Sunday; and when, please tell us, can the Carnegie labor slaves benefit by the library except on Sunday?"
