"EVERY Sunday," says the *World, *"which finds thousands of people in our large cities without means of lawful and innocent recreation and refreshment, deepens the popular determination to make our laws conform to the conditions and customs of a cosmopolitan population." The determination ought to be to make our laws conform to justice, and to the natural rights of the citizen. This they can never do as long as they are used to enforce the observance of any religious institution whatever.
