# Religion Belongs not to the State, but to the Individual.

THE State can have no religion of its own, in behalf of which to frame laws, simply because the State being composed of individuals, it has no existence when separated from those individuals, except in a figure. Religion being a personal matter which each individual member of the State must have for himself, if at all, the State does not need a religion, and could not have one if it would, because no person in the State has power to transfer his religion to the State. If the State has a religion, it must get it from the same source from whence it comes to each individual. But, as the State has no existence outside of its citizens, it can have no religion outside of that which its citizens profess. And the matter of having religion, is left to each individual to decide as he wills. Rev. 22:17. As previously shown, these individuals who form the State, have individual consciences and responsibilities, for which each must singly give account to God. Rom. 14:12. This being true, the State cannot have accountability outside of the individual accountability of those who compose it. And, if the State is not morally accountable, it certainly can have no personal attributes, and therefore no necessity for a religion of its own. More than this: religion operates upon both the head and the heart of the individual, in order to the salvation of the soul. But the State having no personal attributes, has neither a judgment to be convinced, nor a heart in which to receive religious impressions, nor yet a soul to be saved in the world to come.

The State cannot, therefore, make laws touching religion on the plea of its own responsibility; and the citizens do not need such laws, because each one is personally responsible to another tribunal infinitely higher than the State, for his standing in morals. Then all that the State can do, is to make laws prohibiting any man, or any set of men, from interrupting others in the enjoyment of their peculiar form of worship. Any law violating this principle, would work gross injustice to the whole people.

But, because law has been instituted that justice may reign, many have come to believe that all law is justice; or, in other words, that that which is legal is legitimate. But nothing is easier than to frame laws that will pervert the ends of justice. Thus, law is generally made by a certain class of men, who, because of their political influence, can secure enough votes to solidify their opinion into legal statutes. The laws thus made, may be looking almost solely to the benefit of those who brought them into existence, and to the oppression and spoliation of all others. It may readily be seen that laws of this kind, instead of restraining injustice, [283] become its most effective instrument. The proneness of men who have power, is, to abuse it, by making it the instrument of their own aggrandizement, even though their elevation cost the downfall of others. It would not, therefore, be safe to place in the hands of any set of men, the power to prescribe positive duties for their fellow-citizens, either social or religious.

It may be said that some, in a certain community, are ignorant in certain lines of thought and need enlightenment; shall we not therefore have a law to oblige them to be informed? But, if a government were permitted to so far assume paternal care over its subjects, why might it not go further at will? In the language of another, "Why should it not take away the child from its mother, select the nurse, prescribe what ballads shall be sung, what tunes shall be played, what books shall be read, what physic shall be swallowed? Why should they not choose our wives, limit our expenses, and stint us to a certain number of dishes of meat, and of cups of tea?" If government can take the first step in paternal legislation, there is no reason why it may not go the whole journey, and regulate all the affairs of life, in spiritual as well as in temporal things. But, in that case what credentials would the legislators exhibit, to show that Heaven had endowed them with intelligence and virtue above those whom they assumed coercively to teach? How would such men satisfy the unbelieving, that they were Heaven's appointed shepherds? Such an attempt could only lead to hypocrisy, discord, and social disorganization.

There are, in fact, but two ways in which Government can possibly effect its ends. These are, reward and punishment. And while these are powerful in influencing men, their effect is not to make men better, because they do not touch the heart. This point is so well set forth by Mr. Macaulay, that we here give his words:—

> A public functionary who is told that he will be promoted if he is a devout Catholic, and turned out of his place if he is not, will probably go to Mass every morning, exclude meat from his table on Fridays, shrive himself regularly, and perhaps let his superiors know that he wears a hair shirt next his skin. Under a Puritan government, a person who is apprised that piety is essential to thriving in the world, will be strict in the observance of Sunday, or as he will call it, Sabbath, and will avoid a theater as if it were plague-stricken. Such a show of religion as this, the hope of gain and the fear of loss will produce at a week's notice, in any abundance which a government may require. But under this show, sensuality, ambition, avarice, and hatred retain unimpaired power, and the seeming convert has only added to the vices of a man of the world all the still darker vices which are engendered by the constant practice of dissimulation. The truth cannot be long concealed. The public discovers that the grave persons who are proposed to it as patterns, are more utterly destitute of moral principle and of moral sensibility, than avowed libertines. It sees that these Pharisees are further removed from real goodness than publicans and harlots. And, as usual, it rushes to the extreme opposite of that which it quits. It considers a high religious profession as a mark of meanness and depravity. On the very first day on which the restraint of fear is to be taken away, and on which men can venture to say what they think, a frightful peal of blasphemy and ribaldry proclaims that the short-sighted policy which aimed at making a nation of saints, has made a nation of scoffers.—*Essays*,* Leigh Hunt, Par. 19.*

The foregoing statement, by Mr. Macaulay, may easily be confirmed. Look at France, during the closing days of Louis XIV. When the king became religious, he frowned on all who neglected church duties, and rewarded the pious with blue ribbons and pensions. Soon, the city of Versailles became as solemn as a convent; the marshals of the army were observed to be frequently at prayer; it became fashionable for even the great and wealthy to carry prayer-books in their pockets, and to fast during Lent. This lasted no longer, however, than the life of the king. As soon as he was dead, every one hastened to break away from such rigid lines, and to plunge to excess in licentiousness. Those, who, "a short time before, went about looking so demure, consulting the priests about the state of their souls, were now found at the midnight gaming-table, hiccoughing out atheistical arguments and obscene jests." Indeed it is said that the most dissolute of men of an earlier reign, would have blushed at the orgies that accompanied the reaction.

It was the same in England, during the days of the Puritan ascendency. No person suspected of hostility to the church could obtain favor with the government; the theaters were closed; the fine arts were restrained, and Parliament solemnly resolved that, "no person shall be employed but such as the House shall be satisfied of his real godliness." As the result, men dressed in plain garb, wore lank hair and coarse shirts, talked through their noses and showed the whites of their eyes. When a counter-political movement came, a time of wild and desperate dissoluteness followed, and the amount of debauchery seen was appalling. In no case would like efforts result in anything else. Any government which attempts things beyond its reach, will not only make a failure, but produce the very opposite of that which it desires.

To encourage true religion, more is required than temporary reward and punishment, since, as has already been shown, these can have only an outward effect. True, laws may be framed, which will punish for the practice of, or the refusal to comply with, certain forms of religion; but these laws cannot reach the seat of religion, which they should do to have the proper effect. Religion occupies a realm which it is impossible for the State to enter, or for human laws to reach. A parent, even with all the authority God has given him over his child, cannot make him religious by commanding him to be so. Whoever worships God, does so under the guidance of his own reason and conscience, and not by the authority of another's will.

Religion, then, being a matter of private concern, something between the soul and its God, a civil government organized solely for the public good, cannot extend its agency to the administration or regulation of religion, without usurping God's prerogative, and trampling on man's rights at the same time. No human authority can divorce a soul from his obligations to the law of Jehovah, nor properly coerce one into piety, since his reason and conscience are peculiarly his own, and must remain so, as long as he lives. Man's obligations, therefore, which bind him to God, make him free in this respect, from human authority. Yet religious freedom is not freedom from all human authority, but freedom to follow the dictates of conscience without hindrance.

This does not suppose that any one may be privileged to carry out selfish desires under the garb of religion, when such a course would be a trespass upon the civil liberties of others. But, so long as the exercise of his religion does not trespass on the civil rights of others, the civil government cannot, in justice, interfere with his religious liberty.
