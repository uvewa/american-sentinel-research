THE Law and Order League, of Long Branch, has given notice to the Board of Commissioners, that the Board and the police will be held responsible for any further violations of the Sunday statutes. The present Board of Commissioners was elected under a pledge to enforce strict Sunday closing. In fulfillment of this pledge, and spurred on by the injunctions of the Law and Order League, notices have been posted, that all places which supply the wants of Sunday visitors must be closed during Sunday.
