# The Real Reason.

COMMENTING editorially upon the case of the Tennessee Adventist, fined for working on Sunday, and whose cause has been espoused by the National Religious Liberty Association, the Sigourney, Iowa, *Review*, of July 9, gives the following excellent analysis of the motives of those who demand, and enforce, such laws as that under which Mr. King is being persecuted:—

The witnesses who testified against Mr. King did not claim that any religious meeting was disturbed, or that they themselves were disturbed, or that any of their individual rights were invaded by his Sunday plowing, but only that their moral sense was shocked by his violation of the Sunday law, and this shock the court held to be a nuisance. These witnesses imagined that they possessed a moral sense, but we are rather inclined to doubt it. It is a very common human frailty to mistake bigotry and intolerance for moral sense. Men dearly love to make other men do as they do, especially in private individual matters that concern nobody else, and when they find men with minds of their own who will not obey their arbitrary commands, they are mad enough to tear them to pieces. The moral sense of the Chaldeans was terribly shocked when Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refused to bow down to Nebuchadnezzar’s golden image. It was not through any sympathy or fear that some terrible judgment would fall on these Hebrew children for their impiety, for they were eager to roast them in the fiery furnace. It was not any Christian love for Mr. King or any anxiety for the future salvation of his soul, that actuated his religious prosecutors in their efforts to stop him from plowing on Sunday. They were ready to rob him of his hard earned cash by heavy fines, and they would not hesitate to torture him to death, rather than allow him to exercise his right of conscience differently from what they had ordered.

After all, religious intolerance is nothing more than human egotism in its secondary or brother’s-keeper stage. When a man conceives an idea in regard to diet, dress, rule of life or religious observances, he wants everybody else to see it just as he does. That they refuse to so see it or observe it, is to him a standing challenge to the wisdom of his position, which his conceit cannot brook, and he naturally craves the power to force them to observe something that he can’t convince them of by facts, figures, or logic. After preaching his hobby till he gets a little following he organizes, and memorializes some political party to give him a law to enable him to force his theory on the rest of his brethren, in exchange for the votes of his organization, and if his organization amounts to anything as a political factor he usually gets the legislation he wants.

We don’t believe that the religious people of Tennessee are any better than those of other States. We doubt if one in ten of them strictly observes the Sunday law they have forced on the statutes, and we have no idea that it was the salvation of men’s souls they were thinking of when they clamored for the law under which they have been persecuting King. They observed, or pretended to observe, Sunday as a holy day, and imagined that they were doing a very praiseworthy act in so observing it, and expected the balance of mankind to look up to them with great reverence and respect on account of their piety. But the man who did not so observe the day, appeared to them as a standing challenge to their assumed superiority, and they wanted a law to punish him, not because they thought that God was unable to suitably punish the violators of his holy law, but because it hurt their human vanity to have their pretensions to great moral virtues disputed, and they wanted their revenge.

All these religious laws and prosecutions which have stained the history of the Church in all ages, come not from an earnest Christian endeavor to elevate mankind, but from the malicious disposition of the professor of religion to punish the man who dares to question the superior excellence of his professions. The religious Sunday observer of Tennessee could afford to be lenient with the squirrel hunters whose rifles could be heard popping in the timber on all hours of that holy day. He could easily ignore their violation of his Sunday law because the transgressors were low white trash whose influence cut no figure, but when a man making equally high religious professions with himself, whose life was just as pure and exemplary, who derived the authority for his position from the same sacred volume from which he derived his, and could defend his position with arguments and citations which could not be refuted, when such a man disputed the sanctity of his Sunday observance, a challenge was thrown out which he could not afford to ignore without serious sacrifice of his professed sanctity. It was not Mr. King’s soul he cared to save from the consequences of his Sunday labor. It was Mr. King’s influence that challenged the soundness of his theology, and set at naught his assumed religious superiority and authority, and aroused a combative malice, that would have lighted the fagots around the seventh-day observer, had the law of the State permitted it.

THE *Advocate*, a prohibition journal of Watertown, this State, is calling for the more vigorous enforcement of existing Sunday laws. Speaking of the growing disregard of Sunday, the *Advocate* says: “If allowed to go on unchecked, a Continental Sabbath, or a Sabbath without regard to a law compelling a suspension of business, will be substituted in this country instead of the Sabbath of our fathers. Against such an innovation we strongly protest.”

[239-240]

THERE was a strike of Sunday car drivers a week or two since in Brooklyn, not as might be supposed, however, against Sunday work, but for pay by the day instead of by the trip.

THE *Voice* says that “although Francis Murphy is dead set against prohibition a resolution was unanimously passed at one of his South Omaha meetings, last week, calling upon Mayor Sloan to enforce the prohibition laws on Sunday.” Yes; love for Sunday, and laws for its enforcement, take precedence of all opposition to the liquor traffic, in the minds of thousands of people both in and out of the Prohibition Party.

THE *Loyal American* found something in THE AMERICAN SENTINEL which it thought was awry, and asked for an explanation. We have given it; now it is our turn. In its issue of July 2, it sets forth among its principles this:—

> We want all wills to be signed thirty days before death, or failing that, the State shall divide the estate among the heirs.

Now we should like the *Loyal American *to explain just how every man is to know when he is within thirty days of his death so that he can make his will, and escape the penalty here proposed? We pause for a reply.

THE Pittsburgh *Christian Advocate* is not pleased with the present administration. It says:—

> We confess to very great disappointment in the religious features of President Harrison’s administration. He is a Christian man, an officer, and for years a Sabbath-school teacher in the Presbyterian Church. Much was expected of him in the way of proper example in his high office, and of respect for the Christian principles and sentiment of the country. But in some respects we have not seen them. Intoxicating liquors have been served on his table on State occasions, and lately a “german,” one of the most offensive and disgusting of all the public dances, was given in the White House. It was a full dress (rather undress) affair, such as but few thoughtful mothers would suffer their daughters to attend. Chaplain Milburn says there has not been any such public exhibition in the presidential mansion since the marriage of President Tyler. Pretty soon the people will wonder what the difference is between a Christian president and one who is not a Christian.

This illustrates the evil of calling any man a “Christian president.” People *will *wonder what difference there is between a “Christian president” and one who is not “Christian;” and the conclusion arrived at is likely to be, that a “Christian president” is one who makes a profession of religion, and is governed by the policy of his party and the customs of Washington society, while a non-Christian president is one who makes no profession and is governed in just the same way.

DOCTOR GUTHRIE, the eminent Presbyterian divine, is credited with this statement:—

> I counted in Paris thirty-three theaters and places of amusement, open on the Sabbath day, but in one hour I saw in Edinburg, with all her schools, churches, and piety, more drunkenness than I saw in Paris in five months.

This shows that Sunday laws are practically worthless as a temperance measure; if people are in the habit of drinking, and have opportunity to get liquor six days in the week it is useless to attempt to keep it from them on Sunday.

THE Louisiana Legislature has had before it a substitute for the State Sunday law, in the form of a bill giving to police juries and municipal corporations throughout the State the power to regulate all Sunday trade, etc. The measure is really local option applied to the Sunday question. The bill passed the Legislature, but was vetoed by the Governor.

The *Pearl of Days* noticing the bill, says, “It is a measure that no friend of the Sabbath ought to approve.” Certainly no National Reformer would approve it; the aim of that party is to centralize the control of all the moral questions in which they interest themselves, into one infallible, papal head, and no such approach to individual freedom of choice, as local option even, could be permitted in their politics.

THE preachers of Milwaukee, not long since, discussed in their Monday meeting, the subject of “Capital and Labor.” The following resolution was introduced:—

> *Resolved,* By this Preachers’ Conference, that we are in full sympathy with the laboring people of this city, and stand ready at any and all times to manifest friendly, fraternal regard to each. Our churches are open to every one, and all shall be cordially welcomed when they desire to come.

The resolution was fully discussed, but was mostly objected to on the ground that it seemed to imply that the laboring classes had not before been welcomed to the churches, and the following resolution was substituted:—

> *Resolved,* That this Preachers’ Conference is in full sympathy with all the people of this city, rich or poor, learned or unlearned, and stands ready at all times to welcome all to our churches and assist any to lead a better life.

This was unanimously adopted. But that the first resolution should have ever been introduced, or the second one either introduced or adopted, is, in itself, a grave reflection upon the influence of those churches. When professed Christian churches have to advertise that the people are welcome to attend them, and welcome to their assistance to lead a better life, in other words, when they have to advertise that they are Christians, they are in a sorry plight so far as Christianity is concerned. But there is entirely too much of that kind of Christianity in the United States, and that is why there is so much demand that the State shall take charge of religious instruction and religious observances.

AT the Catholic Congress held at Baltimore, last year, a committee was appointed to arrange for another one to be held in connection with the World’s Fair in 1892. The *Catholic Review* of June 29, urges upon the committee prompt and steady action in preparing for the Congress. It says that “the Congress will be an American Congress, but the celebration must# be continental, and delegates from every diocese in North and South America, representatives from every race on the continent should find recognition on this occasion.” We wait now to see what steps the National Reform Association, and the American Sabbath Union will take to secure the recognition of representatives in that Congress.

THE St. Paul *Dispatch* supports the decision of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, in the Edgerton Bible case, and says: “In view of the severity with which the founders of our constitutional systems plainly regarded all possibility of interference with individual religious belief or individual right of conscience, it is safe to say, that the proper and the more advisable course in the discharge of the duty of the State, to afford secular instruction to its citizens, is to wholly eliminate all form of religious instruction, and leave the discharge of that duty where- it rightfully belongs, with the parents of the several children.”

THE Sunday Alliance, of Scotland, communicates to the Sunday Union, of the United States, a report of the progress of the work of the Alliance for the past year in Scotland; a paragraph is devoted to the commendation of the American Sunday Union, and the *Mail and Express.* Thus steadily are these forces for the promotion of political religion joining hands round the world.
