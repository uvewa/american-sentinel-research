THE Law and Order League, of Irondequoit, New York, has undertaken to stop Sunday baseball playing in that place. On Sunday, July 20, a number of the members of the League accompanied by a justice of the peace, and several constables, appeared upon the grounds where a game was in progress, and ordered the playing stopped; they had not provided themselves with warrants, however, and were obliged to withdraw.

Immediately at the close of the game the players obtained their own arrest, and gave bonds for their appearance before a justice of their own choosing.

This was not quite so scandalously ludicrous a travesty on "law and order" as that which characterized the breaking up of a Sunday ball game at the Driving Park, near Alexandria, Virginia, some time ago. On that occasion a colored justice was summoned, the case heard immediately, and the players fined two dollars each and costs. After this was satisfied, the officers attempted to re-arrest on another charge, that of holding a public exhibition on Sunday; but the manager sprang into his carriage and escaped; whereupon, angered at this and the loss of possible fees, the deputy sheriff chased the colored justice off the grounds with a drawn pistol.

Such incidents as these are samples of the enforcement of "civil Sabbath" laws under the influence of the Sunday Union. It is impossible to conceive of a more ridiculous burlesque of either civil justice or true religion.
