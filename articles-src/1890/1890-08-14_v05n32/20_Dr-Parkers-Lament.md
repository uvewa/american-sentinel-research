IT is stated that in a recent lecture in London, Dr. Parker said:—

> Sunday is... given up to parties at your homes, bicycling, and lawn-tennis, even among occasional church-goers, who would vote against the opening of museums on Sunday.

It should be remembered that this is in "Christian" England, where they have a national Sunday law, an established church, and about all that the National Reformers insist would make it a Christian nation. The moral is, that people cannot be made religious by law. Another thought in connection with it is, that this Sunday intolerance affects people very similarly in every part of the world; the "Christians" who want to compel others to keep Sunday when they do not keep it themselves, are not confined to England, some of them are to be found in New York, and we have even heard of them as far west as California.
