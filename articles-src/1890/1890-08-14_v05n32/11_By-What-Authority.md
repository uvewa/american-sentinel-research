# By What Authority?

THE Colorado *Catholic* of June 21, gives editorial expression to a few points which are worthy of consideration by the Sunday Union, and National Reform Association. The *Catholic* says:—

> The ranting and raving of certain ministers of Denver anent Sunday observance is becoming simply disgusting. Last Sunday a certain minister went about from church to church airing himself on the question. What right had he to say to any man that he must deprive himself of any amusement on Sunday? Did Jesus Christ, in whom he professes to believe, appoint Sunday as a day of rest? No, he did not. Why then should these ministers assume to themselves the right to tell any man what he must do on Sunday? . . . Yes. the world concedes that man needs a day of rest. What right have you to say it shall be Sunday? . . . . Sunday is to be observed by religious worship and prayer, not because of any State law. but because God has commanded it. He has commanded it through his church, therefore it is to be observed in the manner indicated by that church. Now, the church which has appointed Sunday as a day of rest—the day Mr. Crafts follows—never demanded the puritanical and nonsensical observance required by him. . . . But we say to you, ministers of Denver, you have no right to demand any religious observance of Sunday unless you find it in your rule of faith—the Bible—which you may search till the day of doom for a single text to sustain your position. Do not resort to civil process for support, for our Constitution guarantees us religious liberty, and you have no right to say to any man that he must be sanctimonious and hypocritically pious instead of light hearted and merry, which the Catholic Church bids all her children to be.

There is nothing uncertain or indefinite about these statements. Do the Sundaylaw advocates acknowledge their truth or deny them? If they deny, upon what authority do they base their denial?

ONE of our exchanges, the *Orleans Herald,* is a little mixed on the proper functions of the State. Some time since we said that “the manufacture, transportation, and sale of intoxicating liquors, so far as the authority of Congress or the police power of the State is concerned, has nothing to do with morals, but is solely a matter of the jurisdiction of the municipal law.”

To this the *Herald* takes exception, and asserts that the State *has* something to do with morals. We imagine, however, that the only difference between us is on the use of the word “moral.” The State certainly forbids some things that are immoral just as it forbids some things that are sinful; but it does not, or at least should not, forbid anything simply because it is immoral, or sinful. If the State does forbid things because they are immoral, or sinful, which is the same thing, it must forbid and undertake to punish all sin; this the State cannot do; it follows that it can properly forbid only those things that are uncivil, and that it can forbid them only because they are uncivil. We use the word “moral” only in the sense of pertaining to or being in harmony with the divine law. The *Herald* evidently gives it a wider signification.

ON May 17, in the Senate, Mr. Manderson, from the Committee on Printing, reported back favorably the following resolutions previously introduced by Mr. Blair, of New Hampshire:—

> *Resolved*, That the Senate Miscellaneous Document No. 43, of the Fiftieth Congress, be reprinted for the use of the Senate, and that five hundred copies be printed for the use of the Committee on Education and Labor.

> *Resolved,* That there be one thousand copies of Notes of Hearing on Joint Resolution (S. R. 86 of the Fiftieth Congress) proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States respecting establishments of religion and free schools, printed as a document for the use of the Senate, and five hundred copies for the use of the Committee on Education and Labor.
The resolutions were agreed to, and the documents ordered republished. These republications are the reports of the hearings on the Sunday-rest bill, and the Constitutional amendment providing for the teaching of the Christian religion in the public schools, held before the Senate Committee on Education and Labor, in the last Congress, and contain the arguments in opposition to those measures, by A. T. Jones, and J. O. Corliss. [238]
