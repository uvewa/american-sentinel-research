THE *Inter-Ocean* says, that under the compulsory education law of Illinois, some school trustees "have assumed the right to indulge their individual prejudices against parochial schools." Yes, such laws as that are always used that way. The proper thing to do to put a stop to it, is to blot from the statute books such laws, forever.
