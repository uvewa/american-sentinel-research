THE Paterson (N. J.) *Press* has written to the authorities of one hundred-and- three of the principal cities of the United States for information as to the regulations governing the use of their public parks on Sunday. Replies were received from eighty-nine, and of these, New Orleans is the only city which makes no distinction between Sunday and other days of the week. Washington, D. C., and Richmond, Virginia, furnish no means of recreation and permit no amusements whatever in their parks on Sunday.

The comparison which the city of Washington bears in this regard to the other cities of the country, is an interesting fact to note, when it is remembered with what urgency a local Sunday law was pressed, at Washington, last winter. It is but another evidence of that which the entire country now knows, namely, that the whole effort was only an attempt to secure political capital to further the general movement for a national Sunday law.
