REV. W. F. CRAFTS, in his tour across the continent and back, seems to have made the journey especially to tell the people how bad a small sect known as Seventh-day Adventists are. In his visit to Peoria, Illinois, he did but little else than denounce this sect. He represented them as very bitterly opposed to all Sunday legislation, and gave utterance to the most scathing anthemas because of such opposition. He stated that if they would use the same opposition toward the liquor traffic, that they do toward Sunday laws, the saloon would be banished from the land in a year.

If we are correctly informed, Seventhday Adventists only number about thirty thousand. And if it is true that so small a number of Christians could rout the saloon in a year, why doesn't Mr. Crafts turn *his* guns in that direction, and try to find the requisite number to engage in the work with him? Certainly if the saloon could be driven from the country, it would be more beneficial to the morals of society than all the benign influences ever dreamed of, in Sunday laws.

Now what will Mr. Crafts do? Will he take back his rash statement, or will he insist that there are not thirty thousand Christians in the United States working for temperance? If the temperance army is not that strong, we would suggest that it be reinforced from the ranks of the workers for Sunday legislation. If it should be said that Sunday desecration and intemperance go hand in hand, and that working for Sunday laws is really working for temperance, we must insist on saying that the proof is wanting. Any one with ordinary observation knows that there are multiplied thousands of good citizens who are strongly opposed to the saloon, and yet they do not observe Sunday at all. They either spend the day at their ordinary business, or else in some harmless recreation. The facts are too apparent for any one to say that a failure to observe Sunday religiously is always accompanied by intemperance.

The saloon element, it is true, pay but little regard to Sunday, and generally spend the day in drunken carousals. It is not their failure to keep Sunday that drives them to the saloon; but because of their habit of strong drink, and the influence of the saloon, their sensibilities are so benumbed that they do not regard any principles of morality as they should. So if Mr. Crafts has carefully made his estimate, and is sure thirty thousand zealous Christians can rout the saloon in a year, we earnestly advise him to devote his energies to the destruction of this great social evil, and when the cause of so much misery is removed the iniquity will cease of itself. We hope Mr. Crafts will free himself from the delusion that working for Sunday laws will advance temperance, and turn his misguided zeal and energy to hunting up his thirty thousand Christians, and by inspiring them with intense devotion to the temperance cause, either prove his statement to be true, or else quit telling that Seventh-day Adventists could rout the saloon in a year, if they would devote themselves to that work.A. O. TAIT.
