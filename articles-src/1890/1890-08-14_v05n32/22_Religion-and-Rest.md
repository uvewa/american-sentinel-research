A CORRESPONDENT of the Duluth *News, *makes the following good point:—

> Rev. W. F. Crafts, of the American Sabbath Union, after presenting his reasons for a Sunday law before an audience of workingmen, was asked if a law could not be made demanding one day of rest in seven, leaving the individual to choose his day. Mr. Crafts replied: "If you take religion out of the day, you take the rest out of it." Now, if you cannot get rest on Sunday without religion, and a law is made compelling you to rest, what else is it but a law compelling you to be religious?

The fact is that were it not for their religious regard for Sunday, neither Mr. Crafts nor any other minister would be found pleading for a Sunday law. The history of the eight-hour movement, and other labor reforms, proves this; the ministers have, as a class, interested themselves in none of them.
