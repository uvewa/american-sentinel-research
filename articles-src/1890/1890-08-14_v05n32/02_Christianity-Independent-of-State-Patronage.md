WE are told that being without a State church, we are a Godless Nation. But the religious life of a nation does not depend upon the alliance of the church with the secular power. Christianity achieved its noblest work while untrammelled with the golden fetters of the State. If the religion of Jesus has not sufficient vitality to stand, independent of State patronage, then let it fall.—*Rev. Joseph Glasson.*
