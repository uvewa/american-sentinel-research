THE *Leader* (Baptist) of May 29, published an account of a Baptist Biblereading Conference at San Bernardino. As at Oakland, Dr. Read conducted the Bible - reading on "The Lord's Day." His arguments on this we have previously noticed. At the close, the observance of the day, and the "civil sabbath," were touched upon. The report in the *Leader *said:—

> How shall we observe the Lord's day? Whatever brings you nearer to Christ is right; whatever leads you farther away from him is wrong.

> If the Sunday newspaper puts you in a more devotional frame of mind, then read it.
> Now, as to the civil sabbath, all that we can consistently ask is protection in our own observance. If a band of music persists in playing near us while at our worship and disturbs the quiet of the day to us, we can appeal for protection to the civil authorities, but if they go off in some canon to themselves we cannot consistently call for any enactments to prohibit them. I am in favor of the Sunday closing of saloons, but only on the condition that they close all the time, for they are a nuisance anywhere, any time, and all the time. The enactment of laws based on simple Christian commands savors too much of the spirit that martyred the early Baptists in New England. It leads to union of Church and State. The only recourse for Christians is to suffer for Christ.
Would that all Baptists and Christians held such sound principles.—*Signs of the Times.*
