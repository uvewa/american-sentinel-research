HAVING learned that a State or a Nation cannot become a moral creature, by reason of its having been formed of men who are individually accountable, the next inquiry which naturally presents itself, is, what kind of a creature, then, is the State? and what are its functions? These are very important questions, and if properly answered, will solve the problem, of how far the interests of the Church and the State are identical.

It cannot be successfully disputed that civil government is ordained of God, for this is so stated by the Scriptures. Rom. 13:1. But for what purpose? To rule in religious matters? If so, then what need of the Church? Why not let the State be the Church, and have all the gospel ordinances administered by government officers? In that case, each government officer would, of course, be inducted into office by prayer and imposition of hands, in the same way as officers of the church. It may be objected that such an extreme would not be admissible, because it would necessarily degrade Christian ordinances to the level of secular matters. True enough; but if civil government is ordained of God to regulate, in any degree, matters of religion, who shall say where its powers must end? Did not the Apostle Paul exhort the Roman Christians to be subject to the "powers that be" for conscience' sake? Yet the very work of preaching the gospel, in which that apostle was engaged, was opposed to the religion and laws of the Roman Government. The religion of Rome, at that time, was pagan, and that was controlled by the State. The religion Paul preached was Christianity, to which Rome was uncompromisingly opposed. Neander, in his Church History, quotes the following from Cicero, as one of Rome's fundamental maxims of legislation:—

> No man shall have, for himself particularly, gods of his own. No man shall worship, by himself, any new or foreign gods, unless they are recognized by the public laws. Vol. I, pages 86, 87, Torrey's translation, 1852.

And yet in the face of law so stringently opposed to Christianity, the apostle exhorted the subjects of Rome, who professed Christianity, to be subject to the "powers that be," calling them the "higher powers," and declaring that they were "ordained of God." Now, if that Government was ordained of God, to enforce such laws as it did against Christianity, then how manifestly wrong was it for the Apostle Paul to preach a religion in Rome, which was diametrically opposed to the laws of Rome! Looking at the matter in this light, Nero did the work of a minister of God in executing wrath upon the Christians for not conforming to the laws of the country, which commanded all to "worship the gods in all respects, according to the laws of your country, and compel all others to do the same; but hate and punish those who would introduce anything whatever, alien to our customs in this particular."

This was Roman law. Yet Paul himself, as well as the other apostles, practiced that which was plainly in violation of that statute, and suffered death in consequence. They justified themselves, too, in the course they pursued, by asserting that the law of God had higher claims on them than the laws of earthly governments.

At one time, when Peter and John had been preaching the gospel contrary to the law under which they lived, they were threatened by the authorities for so doing, and were commanded to desist from such a course. They simply replied, "Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye." Acts 4:19. That all might know how they regarded the authority of the civil power in religious matters, they still kept on preaching Christ; but were again apprehended, and brought before the council. They were then reminded of the caution given them a short time before; but the apostles quietly said, "We ought to obey God rather than man." Acts 5:29. These answers of the apostles plainly show the position they occupied, relative to this matter. They did not have the faintest idea that the State had the least authority in matters of religion. More than that; their words plainly teach that human laws are utterly incapable of meeting the requirements of the individual conscience, and are therefore inadequate to regulate matters of personal faith toward God.

Why, then, were those injunctions regarding the "powers that be," given by the Apostle Paul to the Roman Christians? Manifestly to teach them that their relation to Christianity in no way absolved them from their duty as citizens, to the government under which they lived. Although they had come to recognize the King of Heaven as their spiritual Ruler, they were not to forget that civil governments have a part to act, in procuring peace and protection to the honest and industrious, and, for that purpose, were ordained of God. And, although the king of the country in which they lived, was a wicked heathen, they would not be justified in refusing to obey his laws, which imposed taxes to maintain peace and public order. So long as those laws did not contravene that law [252] which is above all—the law of God—they were enjoined to observe them, as duties toward their fellow-men, which were covered by the law of their heavenly King.

Civil government, then, is ordained of God, for the sole purpose of regulating affairs between man and his fellow-man. This is as true of a heathen as of a Christian power, as seen from the fact that Paul made such a statement and applied it to the Roman Government, when it was intensely pagan, and even when it was ruled by Nero. But, admitting this, it does not follow that God ordains each statute enacted by civil governments, or any of the statutes thus enacted. To say that every civil magistrate holds office by divine authority, and has, therefore, a right to rule in religious things, is stating that which every one knows is not, and cannot be, true. For, in that case, no man, whoever he may be, would have any alternative but to obey the mandates of the civil authority in divine as well as earthly things, without a question as to whether it was just or not. This would destroy all necessity for any one but the magistrate to read the Bible, in which is found recorded the will of God. Moreover, such a rule would make the magistrate's conscience the rule for all under his jurisdiction, and would, therefore, destroy the relation man is supposed to sustain toward God, by making him, in religious matters, wholly responsible to the magistrate rather than to God. This principle is well illustrated by the statement of Louis XIV., when, on his deathbed he was approached in relation to his spiritual condition. His answer was, "I have left all these matters with the church, and I expect they have attended faithfully to them." Here was a man who had been taught to depend wholly on the church, as an institution divinely guided, and the consequence was that, in all his wicked career, he never acknowledged any responsibility except to that institution upon which he had been prone to lean. The same condition of things would surely follow with those who were led to believe in the divine appointment of all the magistrates of the land.

It is well known, however, that the powers of civil authority are always obtained and regulated according to the peculiar notions of those who happen to be in authority; and the way governmental authority has usually been obtained, is well stated by Macaulay, in his essay on "Gladstone on Church and State":—

> A nation of barbarians pours down on a rich and unwarlike empire, enslaves the people, portions out the land, and blends the institutions which it finds in the cities with those which it has brought from the woods. A handful of daring adventurers from a civilized nation wander to some savage country, and reduce the aboriginal race to bondage. A successful general turns his arms against the State which he serves. A society, made brutal by oppression, rises madly on its masters, sweeps away all old laws and usages, and when its first paroxysm of rage is over, sinks down passively under any form of polity which may spring out of the chaos. A chief of a party, as at Florence, becomes imperceptibly a sovereign, and the founder of a dynasty. A captain of mercenaries, as at Milan, seizes on a city, and by the sword makes himself its ruler. An elective senate, as at Venice, usurps permanent and hereditary power. It is in events such as these, that governments have generally originated; and we can see nothing in such events to warrant us in believing that the governments thus called into existence, will be peculiarly well fitted to distinguish between religious truth and heresy. *Par. 33.*

Yet such as these, were among the "powers that be," and existed in the providence of God; not, however, to regulate religion among men, but to maintain order and the proper relations between man and man. To say more than this, would be to assert that God ordained the powers of the East to maintain Mohammedanism and Buddhism. This could not be true; otherwise the gospel commission conferring authority to carry the gospel into all the world, was a mistake, and the labors of foreign missionaries in heathen countries, are all out of order.

The truth is, that the language of Paul to the Roman Christians, was designed to state only a general truth, which was applicable to every form of government in order to ensure peace and prosperity to God's creatures everywhere. Order in government may be seen even in the lower grades of creation. We have only to watch a colony of honey-bees for a short time, when it will be seen that they have governmental order, and are controlled in all their movements, by some acknowledged head. And those proverbially enterprising insects known as ants, are said, by naturalists, also to be governed by specific laws which are rigidly carried out in each community of these little creatures. The governmental powers of these, and other orders of the animal creation, were just as much ordained of God, as were human governments; yet it does not follow that their powers of government were designed to extend to religious things.
