ON April 9, Senator Vance introduced in the Senate, "A bill to release certain church property in the District of Columbia from taxation," which enacts, "That all taxes and special assessments which may have been heretofore charged against any church property in the District of Columbia, but remaining unpaid, be cancelled and released: *provided,* that at the time such tax or special assessment was levied, the property in question was used exclusively for church purposes."

Thus, unquestioned, would the United States Government recognize the demand of the Church for this *modicum* of indirect support from the State. As church property is untaxed, so all other property must submit to a heavier taxation in proportion, and therefore the taxes, which the church property would otherwise pay, are divided *pro rata* among all tax-payers, and consequently the entire taxable property is assessed with the church taxes.

By this indirection the churchman obtains from the non-churchgoer just so much towards the aggrandizement of his church, and the more worldly, wealthy, covetous and miserly the church organization is, just so much more involuntary support and aid it draws from those who are not in sympathy with its hoarding methods.
