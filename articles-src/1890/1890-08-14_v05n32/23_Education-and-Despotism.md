PRINCE BISMARCK is credited with the following:—

> Over-education led to much dissatisfaction and disappointment in Germany, but in Russia it led to disaffection and conspiracy. There were ten times as many people educated for the higher walks as there were places to fill. Further, education was making pedantic theorists and visionaries, unfit for constitutional government. It would be madness to put such men in authority. Russians do not know yet what they want; they must therefore be ruled with a rod of iron.

Of course education unfits men to be ruled by despots. Education familiarizes men with the truth that governments derive their just powers not by inheritance, but by the consent of the governed; it is, therefore, the foe of autocrats.
