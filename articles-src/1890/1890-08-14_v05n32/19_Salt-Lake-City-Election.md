AUGUST 4, an election was held in Salt Lake City, in which the Liberal, or anti-Mormon ticket, was successful. Referring to this fact, the *Mail and Express *says:—

> Again the Christians have whipped their opponents. In yesterday's election the Liberals carried the county by majorities ranging from three to five hundred, although the Mormons had placed a bogus ticket, called a "workingmen's ticket," in the field. The contest was bitter and exciting.

Thus, it appears that in Utah whatever is anti-Mormon is "Christian." We have no idea, however, that the men who engaged in this "bitter and exciting" contest had any idea of doing it as Christians, but only as citizens. The use of the word "Christian" in this connection, is due to the determination of the *Mail and Express* school of politicians to so mix religious and political questions, that the people will entirely lose sight of the difference, and suffer the State to exercise authority in both spiritual and temporal affairs.
