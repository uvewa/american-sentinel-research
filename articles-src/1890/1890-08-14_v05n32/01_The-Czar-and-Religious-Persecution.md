THE Czar seems to be determined that Russia shall be a "Christian" country, even if he has to drive every Jew out of the empire to accomplish that result. A ukase has just been issued, which practically condemns about a million Jews to choose between exile and the endurance of intolerable persecution, merely because they do not agree with this miserable despot in his religious views and practices.
