# What Is Truth?

THE best definition I have ever heard is as follows: “Truth is that which, in the face of all possible opposition, can be shown to be in conformity with fact and sound reason.” It follows from the very definition that truth is never afraid of error or falsehood. It always meets them squarely and openly, never asking any unfair advantage, never afraid of competition, and therefore never found asking for a monopoly.

Tried by this standard, the true nature of the Sunday-law movement will at once appear.

The champions of this movement were *personally invited* to be present at the Washington Citizens’ Meeting, and were assured a fair opportunity of being heard, and of maintaining the truth and right of their positions. Not one of them was there, though some of them, at least, were in the city. They preferred to wait till their own convention, where no one who differed from them was allowed the slightest chance to say a word.

They argue everywhere that it is only a *civil Sunday law* they want. The leading speaker of the American Sabbath Union argued this for an hour in my own hearing, declaring vehemently that we misrepresented the Union entirely, when we said they were seeking religious legislation; and asserting that they only wanted civil Sunday laws in the interests of the “poor over-worked laboring man.”

After his speech he passed out a document to all in the audience who would accept it. It contains the following extract from the constitution of the American Sabbath Union, which states its true basis and object.

> *Article I. Name:* The American Sabbath Union.

> *Article II. Basis:* The basis of this Union is the Divine authority, and universal and perpetual obligation of the Sabbath.
> *Article III. Object:* The object of this Union, is to preserve the *Christian Sabbath* as a day of rest and *worship.*
So it seems that if they are only asking for civil Sunday laws, they are asking for them for a religious purpose; namely, to preserve the day as a day of rest and worship. A law that is desired and obtained for a religious purpose, is a *religious* and not a *civil* law.

Why not call it so? Ah! it would defeat their purpose. Any work that is compelled to resort to such deception *is not the work of God.*

They bring forth. their Sunday-law Bill for the District of Columbia, and ask us to look at its title, and see how innocent it is. “A bill to prevent people from being *forced to labor on Sunday*.” How innocent! How evidently in the interests of liberty! But stop! When you read the bill itself, it is a bill to compel people to stop laboring on Sunday, whether they want *to or not.* Why did they not name it, A bill to *force people to stop laboring on Sunday?* Oh! this would have been a true title, but *truth* would here, as everywhere else, defeat their object.

Again, I heard the leader of this whole-movement say in the Convention held on December last, in New York City, that they were going to introduce this local bill, and concentrate all their effort upon it. Why? Was it because the people of Washington and the District of Columbia were such terrible Sabbath breakers? No, for he admitted that they kept the Sabbath here as well as anywhere in the Nation.

He said, “If we can get the United States to pass a Sunday law for the District of Columbia this year, Congress will then have declared Sunday laws constitutional, and will have no excuse for not giving us a Sunday law for the Nation next year.”

Why was not this argument used in Washington instead of the foolish plea that although the people have been very good Sabbath-keepers in the past, they have but just discovered that they have no Sunday laws, and so must have one right away, or they will engage in revolution,—working on Sunday?

Again I say, it would be the truth, and truth wherever, or whenever it is told means the destruction of all their plans. Out in a city in California, they wanted a Sunday law, but they did not know what to name it. Shakspeare said, “What’s in a name?” But he had not learned the philosophy of the Sunday-law advocates, if he had he would have said, “There’s millions in it,” or rather, every thing in it. Some of them in California were honest enough to want to call it a “religious Sunday law,” others said that would never do, call it a “civil Sunday law;” still others said, “say it is only ‘a police regulation. ’” They finally decided to call it a “sanitary regulation.” It seems to be really as difficult a matter to name a Sunday law, as for a young father and mother to name their first baby. [172]

Now, in general, I should have more faith in a sanitary regulation, if it came from the doctors, than if, as in this case, it came from the ministers. There was a time when nearly all the sanitary regulations came from the ministers instead of the doctors. In those days, even in the large cities, sewers were unknown, and all the filth was thrown into the street; and then the people trusted to charms and priestly incantations, and holy relics, and miracle cures, to deliver them from the pestilence.

This, too, was in the time of the Inquisition,— the Dark Ages of ignorance and persecution. I believe also among the Indians to-day, the medicine men are both priest and doctor. This is only another evidence among many, that the Sunday-law movement is a long step backward toward ignorance and error, and superstition and savagery. In this instance, however, the ministers of California made such wonderful advancement into the mysteries of hygienic science, that they discovered that milk sold on the streets after 5 o’clock Sunday morning, was dangerously *unsanitary.* Again I say, truth does not have to resort to such subterfuges. The truth will always bear to be openly and fairly stated.

But let us examine this “sanitary” argument for Sunday laws. Briefly stated it is as follows: “The physical health of every man and woman demands rest on one day in seven. It is for the good of the State that its citizens should be kept in robust physical condition. Therefore the State may, and must enforce the observance of Sunday rest for civil and sanitary reasons. Admitting the premises for the present, for the sake of argument, let us see if the conclusion follows, or rather let us see where this logic would lead to if adopted by our Government. It is a demonstrated hygienic fact, that the health of every person requires a bath at least once a week. Must the State, then, enforce by law the taking of a bath once a week upon all its citizens? and if so, must it send spies into every family, and even into every private bath room to see that the law is obeyed?” The physical health of all persons, demands about nine hours sleep a night. Must the State by law compel every one to retire to sleep at 9 P.M., and remain in bed until 6 A. M.?

It is evident that when the State once commits itself to the care of the physical health of its citizens there is no. stopping this side of the “paternal government” of the past. The difference between the theory of such governments and our American theory of government, is just the difference between slavery and liberty. The difference between the kind of people raised under such laws, and those raised under our free institutions, is the difference between *children* and *men.*

There are many cases recorded of sudden death, caused by a fit of anger, and it is well proven that all true religion is conducive to good health, and all evil and unrestrained passion tends directly in the other direction; so the government that takes upon itself the guardianship of the physical health of its citizens, might, reasoning thus, establish religion, and bring back the Inquisition at once. They might do this, and claim they did it all for *civil* and *sanitary* reasons, just as the Sunday-law advocates do. Thus it is seen that even admitting their premises, their conclusion does not follow.

But the premises are unproven assumptions. It is not true that every person, whatever his age or occupation, needs just one day’s rest in seven for his physical health. Some need much more, and some have such light work and such robust health that they can do with much less. Thus the whole civil or sanitary Sunday law argument, is based on *false *reasoning from a *false* premise. G. E. FIFIELD.
