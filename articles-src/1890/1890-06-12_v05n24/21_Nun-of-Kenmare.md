SOME of our exchanges are still repeating the story that the Nun of Kenmare had received subscriptions for a forthcoming book and then "disappeared," leaving said subscribers with neither their money nor the book. There never was a particle of truth in the story. There was no disappearance of the Nun. She was filling a lecture engagement in Baltimore, in midwinter, when she took a severe cold, which settled in her throat, affecting it so that she was compelled to break off her engagement, and by the positive direction of physicians go to Florida for her health. But at no time did she disappear, for her publishers as well as her friends knew all the time where she was. Yet her enemies seized upon this circumstance, and, being virtually in control of the press of the country, made it tell for all they could against her. Besides this, when she found that her book would be delayed, she wrote personally from Florida to each subscriber, offering to return the money if he did not want to wait longer than was at first expected for the book. Her enemies however, knowing well that a sensational story stands a much better chance of wide circulation through the daily press than the truth can possibly secure, made the fullest use of their opportunity.

We have the honor to be personally acquainted with the Nun of Kenmare—Miss M. F. Cusack;—we have had an hour's conversation with her, within a week before this writing; and we know that there never was a particle of truth in the story of her disappearance. It was wholly an invention, and the wish that it might be so was the mother of the invention. She is working diligently at the book referred to—"Why I Left the Church of Rome" —and hopes to have it in the press soon. If all the people knew what steady persecutions follow her, and what repeated difficulties meet her, so far from wondering why the book is delayed, they would the rather wonder at the splendid courage that sustains her in undertaking to print the book at all, and in carrying on the noble fight that she is making. From our acquaintance with this lady, we believe her to be a genuine Christian woman, and well worthy of the sympathy and support of everybody who loves Christianity or admires courage.
