Miss MARY F. LATHROP, of the Non- Partisan Woman's Christian Temperance Union, is now on a visit to the Pacific Coast, in the interest of Christian temperance. She met a rather hot reception from some of the partisans of the partisan Woman's Christian Temperance Union. In an address in the First Congregational Church, Oakland, Sunday evening, May 25, she referred to this, and read a letter which she had received from a preacher, before she started for the Coast. In the letter the preacher said to her:—

> Don't you dare to come to California, you scarlet woman of Babylon, you hand-painted Jezebel!

When she had read this, Miss Lathrop lowered her voice and quietly remarked:—

You laugh, my friends, but it is no laughing matter. If connection with political parties inculcates such feelings as this, where Christian love, forbearance and peace and good will should exist, is n't it high time we got away from politics?

So say we. All honor to the womanly women, who have cut loose from a leadership that is characterized by mannishness in women, and womanishness in men.
