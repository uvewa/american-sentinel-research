"THE Protestants and Catholics of Newburyport, Massachusetts," says the *Converted Catholic.,* "are quarrelling over the saloon license. Through the efforts of a secret society all the licenses for that town have been granted to so-called Protestants, and Father Teeling, the Roman Catholic priest, has protested against this unfair discrimination." This item illustrates the impropriety of calling Protestants all who are not Catholics, and of denominating Christian all who are neither Mohammedan nor Pagan. Of course, as the *Converted Catholic* remarks, these people who have received license to sell liquors are not members of any Protestant church, but it is just as proper to call them Protestants as it is to call Christians hundreds of thousands who are so called.
