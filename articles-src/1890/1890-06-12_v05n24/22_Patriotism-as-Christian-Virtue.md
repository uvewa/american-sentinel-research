THE *Christian Statesman* of April 24, copies from the illustrated *Christian Weekly, *an article by the Rev. Robert F. Sample, D. D., in which he says that "patriotism is a Christian virtue." We have read the New Testament through several times, and we never yet discovered this amongst the Christian virtues. One list of these virtues is as follows: "The fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance." Another list gives these: "Faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness, charity." Patriotism is not amongst these, nor is it anywhere mentioned in the New Testament amongst the Christian virtues. How Mr. Sample found it out therefore, when it is not written, we should like to know. Will Mr. Sample give his authority? or, will the *Christian Statesman* give the authority for the statement?
