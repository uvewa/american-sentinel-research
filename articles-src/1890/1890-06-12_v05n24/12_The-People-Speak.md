# The People Speak.

THE following editorial report from the daily *Bodie Miner*, of California, is worth reprinting here. It has the right ring and a good deal of it:—

Last Tuesday J. H. Cook and J. A. Wheeler of the National Religious Liberty Association, arrived in Bodie. These gentlemen are travelling through Eastern California and Western Nevada, obtaining signatures to petitions to Congress asking that body to refrain from any legislation whatever looking to a union of Church and State in the Government of the United States. Considering that we have got along very comfortably, very happily, and very prosperously for over a hundred years without any such cranky nonsense, no sensible man thinks there is any sense in starting it now. The movement which Mr. Cook and Mr. Wheeler are urging is a simultaneous one in every State and Territory in the Union, agents canvassing everywhere for signatures to Congress to let the Constitution remain as it is so far as regards religion or religious tests. Returns of signatures to Washington are made weekly. These gentlemen commenced canvassing for names as soon as they arrived in town, and about every lady and gentleman who understood the matter readily signed the petition.

A mass-meeting was held in Miners’ Union Hall on Thursday evening. The meeting was called to order by Watkin Morgan. Orlando E. Jones was selected for Chairman, Watkin Morgan acting as secretary.

Chairman Jones read the Blair Sundayrest Bill and the Joint Resolution proposing to establish religion in our public schools. Mr. Jones then proceeded, in his customary clear and perspicacious style, to point out the absurdity of legislating on those subjects at all. We are happy, contented, prosperous, rich, and the boss of the world; let us remain so.

F. P. Willard made a very neat and telling little speech in support of the petition, and was heartily applauded throughout.

Harvey Boone, while declining to make any remarks, heartily indorsed the petition and the object of the meeting.

J. H. Cook, who is thoroughly familiar with the entire subject, explained it very lucidly, after which the following resolutions were presented and read:—

> *Resolved,* That we, the people of Bodie, Mono County, California, in mass-meeting assembled, are steadfastly opposed to the adoption by Congress of the United States of the joint resolutions introduced in the Senate by Senator Blair, proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, respecting the establishment of religion and free public schools. That we are opposed to the passage by Congress of the Blair Sunday-rest Bill, and to its kindred measure introduced by Mr. Breckinridge, of Kentucky, and to all other legislation looking to the establishment of any system of religion by the Nation, or by any State; or restricting the right of any citizen to engage in any legitimate, lawful pursuits on any day of the week.

> *Resolved,* That the first section of the joint resolution for the amendment of the Constitution respecting an establishment of religion and free public schools, which reads as follows: “No State shall make any law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,” is not designed to guard the rights of the several States, but to muzzle them, and thus center the power of legislation on the subject of religion for the several States, in the national Legislature.
> *Resolved,* That article second of said joint resolution which proposes to establish and maintain a system of free public schools in which are taught the fundamental principles of the Christian religion, is destructive of the principles of religious and civil liberty, and is wholly un-American in its inception, and deserves the universal condemnation of every American citizen.
> *Resolved,* That the Blair Sunday-rest Bill is wholly a religious bill. Its passage would be religious legislation, therefore, is in conflict with the first amendment. “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” That it is in conflict with the words of Christ, “Render unto Cesar the things that are Cesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s.” That it places a high penalty of crime on conduct not essentially criminal. That it is designedly loose in its wording, “labor to the disturbance of others,” giving every advantage in law to any religious bigot who may chance to have had his mental equilibrium disturbed by Sunday labor, subjecting the offending party to a fine from $10 to $1000; also the premium bid for any one to spy out persons who may have labored and received pay for said labor, in conflict with said law; to bring suit in his own name, and for his own use, and recover said money; all of which speak plainly of the religious and intolerant character of the said bill; that they call loudly on every American citizen to come to the rescue and demand the preservation of the Constitution, as it now is, with all its safeguard against any religious legislation, and protection alike equally to all.
After the reading, N. B. Ward moved that the resolution be adopted. Carried, the vote being unanimous.

Those present were then invited to sign the petition, which all did with alacrity.

Friday morning, Messrs. Cook and Wheeler, having performed a good work in Mono County, left for Hawthorne, and will continue their labors to Candelaria, and down through Inyo. [175-176]

“SOME Christians serve God so tremendously on Sunday,” says Doctor Talmage, “that they are cross and crabbed all the week. Doing too many things on Sunday, they do nothing well all the rest of the week.”

And the Doctor might have added truthfully that as a class such “Christians” are in favor of compelling everybody else to “serve God” just as they do, at least so far as Sunday is concerned. They are generally those who believe that the sum of all religion, worth having, is in Sunday keeping.

OF prayers in Congress, the *Christian Salesman* remarks:—

> “If the silence of the national Constitution as to religion is to be construed as a deliberate and intentional renunciation of all religion by the American Nation, then such prayers, or any prayers, in Congress, or in any State Legislature, are an impertinence and an anachronism, and ought to be abolished.”

That deduction is perfectly logical, and the logic ought to be turned into a fact. Chaplaincies in Congress, in State Legislatures, the army, etc., *are* an impertinence and an anachronism. They are a relic of the hierarchal rule of the Middle Ages, and ought to be abolished. Legally, chaplains are unconstitutional loafers; physically, however, they are strictly constitutional loafers.

THE *Sabbath Advocate,* of Stanberry, Missouri, says that “the present tendency on the part of the people of this Nation is to put down everything that tends to unite Church and State, and consequently Mr. Blair is having poor success in his Sunday legislation. Too vividly does the past come up before us to tolerate such without a struggle. We say down with everything of such tendencies. Christianity can stand without a union with the State.” If the editor of the *Advocate* would take the *Congressional Record* and note carefully the number of petitions presented both in the Senate and House in favor of a national Sunday law he would not feel quite so confident as he seems to that Mr. Blair may not after all be ultimately successful in his efforts to secure religious legislation. The friends of a national Sunday law are making a “still hunt,” but they are doing effective work, and if the advocates of religious liberty suppose that there is no danger they are simply deceiving themselves. But what the *Advocate *says illustrates the situation exactly. The great danger to religious liberty in this country is due in a large measure to the indifference of the people. The great majority think that there is, and can be no danger; and at least a large minority care not a straw whose liberty is infringed so long as *they* are not affected. They fail to realize that the only safety for any class is in *jealously guarding the rights of all alike.*

THE bill which recently passed the Senate forbidding the sale of intoxicating liquors in the District of Columbia on Sunday, was for a time prevented from passing, by Senator Blair, who desired to have it amended. Finally, however, Mr. Blair withdrew his objection to its passage, saying:—

> This particular bill, it seems to be thought, is very good in the way of spoon-victuals, and I do not feel inclined to be an obstacle to the enactment of whatsoever good there may be in it into a law. *It is well to provide for the observance of the Sabbath.*

And so it appears that Senator Blair agrees with us that Sunday-closing laws are in the interests, not of temperance, but of Sunday observance. That bill ought to be killed, and we hope the House of Representatives will do it.

IN the course of a speech to the Senate in introducing a bill to repeal laws providing for the retirement of army and other officers, delivered in the Senate of the United States, April 23, Senator Reagan, of Texas, said:—

> It seems to me we can only account for the creation of privileged classes in this country, on the hypothesis that it is the result of a skillfully devised plan of those in this country who contemn the political doctrines of the illustrious Mr. Jefferson and his followers, who seek by this means to subvert our Federal system of States with reserved rights, and of people with reserved liberties, and on the wreck of this system to establish a strong, consolidated, centralized Government with power to repress and control the popular will, and, in the interest of the few, to establish a Government of force and coercion in the place of our present democratic Government based on the consent and agreement of the people and States.

In these words, Mr. Reagan has expressed the greatest danger which threatens this commonwealth, and one which has already passed its inception.

THE assumption of police power over the State by the Legislature of Massachusetts for the enforcement of the Sundayclosing of saloons, and the earnest effort made by the supporters of that measure to proselyte other States to the same dangerous policy, is still another evidence of the decided trend of the so-called “reformers” toward paternalism in Government.

Mr. Dudley, of Boston, said, in the Sunday Convention, held in Washington last winter: “Massachusetts determined to take it into her own hands to enforce her own laws and to control the police force; but in Boston was shown the force of the law—the power behind it. . . . It has been claimed that this is an interference with the local government, but it is not. Fifty-nine out of every sixty of these convictions are for violations of the Sunday law, and only one for a violation of the city law.”

Thus is shown the growing tendency to place the powers which are legitimately municipal in character, in the hands of the Legislatures, and those which should be in the province of the Legislature solely, to the general Congress. And so they would usher in the age of Bellamyism—not only “looking backward,” but actually going backward, politically, in an attempt to establish the “United Patriarchate of America.”

THE mischief of Sunday laws is again illustrated by a case out in Indiana. Mr. C. W. Cook keeps a hotel at New Haven. Some time ago he allowed the agent of the Toledo Automatic Cigar Company to put up on the outside of his house one of those little machines into which one drops a nickel and gets a cigar. On Sunday April 20, somebody dropped a nickel into the thing, got a cigar and smoked it. Mr. Cook knew nothing about it, had nothing to do with the machine himself, nor has he any of the profits of it at all, but simply allowed the owner of it to place it there, yet *he was prosecuted for Sunday desecration. *A change of venue was secured, and the case was tried in Ft. Wayne. After deliberating all night the jury brought in a verdict of guilty with a fine of one dollar and costs, and the costs amounted to over fifty dollars.

This well illustrates the value of Sunday laws. All they are worth, or that they ever were worth, is simply to give a chance to meddlesome bigots to pester, or vent their spite upon, their neighbors. This is the only earthly thing that Sunday laws are used for now, and it is the only thing they ever will be used for; and if the Sunday-law advocates get the laws enacted which they so long for, this simply illustrates in a very mild way, what will be the fruit of them.
