# The Educational Amendment.

IN a recent editorial on the Blair Educational amendment, the Virginia City *Chronicle* says:—

> “Should the amendment become a part of the national law the necessity would at once exist for each State, or Congress, to establish by law a system of public schools, and to declare in such law what are the ‘fundamental, non-sectarian principles of Christianity.’ The Legislature of each State would declare by statue for the government of the schools what are such ‘fundamental principles,’ and thus there would be a separate religious school code for each of the forty-two States. Considering human nature as we find it, could any sensible person say that the Legislatures of forty-two States could be brought to agree on what are and what are not the ‘fundamental, non-sectarian principles?’

> “The inevitable confusion and conflict which would appear in such legislation but serves to show the soundness of the principle and popular sentiment, that the establishment of religion is not and should never be a function of civil government. The principles of the Christian religion should be left for the Church and not the State to determine. It can hardly be considered that the average member of a State Legislature, or of Congress, is fitted either morally or intellectually to determine for the people, the Church or the schools what is true religion.”
So far as the National Government is concerned, the people of the United States, considered as a body politic, have no religion to teach, no doctrine of God to promulgate, and no form of worship to sustain or enforce.—*S.* T. *Speer, D. D.*
