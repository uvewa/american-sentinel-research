AMONG the many petitions for a national Sunday law presented to Congress during the present session, is one from "one hundred and two citizens of Massachusetts, praying for the better observance of the Sabbath." The query naturally arises, If these petitioners really desire better Sabbath observance why do they not observe it better? There is no law in this country against any man's observing any day just as well as he wishes to. It would be just as appropriate to petition Congress for better attendance at church, or for more regularity in family worship, or for less formality in giving thanks when sitting down to dinner. There is really no difference between petitions to Congress asking for a national Sunday law, and petitions "praying for the better observance of the Sabbath;" the latter, however, show more plainly the wish of the petitioners, namely, the legal enforcement of a religious institution.
