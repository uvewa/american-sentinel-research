A RELIGIOUS paper of Oakland, California, has the following item which contains a thought worth repeating. It says:—

> There is published in Santa Cruz, California, a monthly journal called the *Buddhist Ray,* which boasts of being the first paper of its kind published in a Christian city. It is being circulated in Japan. What is a *Christian* city? And if a city were Christian, would it publish a Buddhist journal? The doctrine of Christ is, "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh." The paper has naught of which to boast. Christ would not recognize Santa Cruz as his, any more than he would Yeddo, Oakland, London, or any other city.
