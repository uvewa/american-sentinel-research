ANOTHER evidence that the workingmen are not crying so loudly for Sunday laws, and that they are not complaining so bitterly of the Egyptian bondage and slavery of being forced to work on Sunday as the Sunday-law advocates claim, is furnished by the Chairman of the Committee of Arbitration in the great Chicago strike which was settled lately. In that, there was no call by the workingmen for the stoppage of Sunday work, there was no complaint about being required to work on Sunday, no demand whatever for any release from Egyptian bondage, nor Sunday labor. There was just this provision in the settlement with regard to Sunday: "Sunday work will be paid for at the rate of double time." That is, wherever men work on Sunday, they are to have double wages over work done on other days. It is probable that pay for Sunday work has not always been at the rate of *double* the pay for work on other days; but nearly always more is paid for work on Sunday than on other days. However, whether that be so or not, it is certain that the workingmen are not nearly as anxious about the question of Sunday labor, as the Sunday-law preachers are.
