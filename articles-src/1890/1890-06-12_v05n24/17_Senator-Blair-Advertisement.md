SOME men are bound to get to the front no matter what it costs; notoriety they will have in one way or another, as is just now strikingly exemplified in the case of Senator Blair, whose picture and name figure prominently in a patent medicine advertisement in several papers. In years to come when it shall be asked, Who was H. W. Blair? the answer will be, He is the man who was cured by Dr. Blank's Wild Cherry and Sarsaparilla Troches.
