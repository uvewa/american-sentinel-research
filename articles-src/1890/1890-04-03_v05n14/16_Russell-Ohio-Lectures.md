STATE SECRETARY E. T. RUSSELL, of Ohio, writes that he has met with a most favorable reception in his lecturing, throughout the State. He finds villages and medium-sized towns to be the most satisfactory fields of labor. It is his custom to give three lectures in a place, and he frequently finds those who assist him materially in the circulation of the petition, and in other ways.
