IF I am a Presbyterian, plowing in my own field along side of the public highway on Saturday, and a Seventh-day Adventist, or Baptist, should pass by on his way to church, and if I should bid him a civil good morning and go on with my work, and then he should complain to the magistrate and ask for my arrest for disturbing his devotions, would I not discover that he was a hypocritical pretender?

On the other hand, if I should pass his field on my way to church on Sunday, and find him at work and prosecute him for it, would he not see that my religion did not bear the impress of the Cross?
