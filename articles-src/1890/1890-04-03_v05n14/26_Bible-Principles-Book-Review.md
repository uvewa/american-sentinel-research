WE have received from the author, Mr. Francis Hope, London, England, a copy of "Bible Principles and the Union of Church and State." The book contains one hundred and thirty pages, bound in flexible covers, is very neat and attractive in appearance and sells for one shilling (twenty-five cents). It is devoted to a discussion of the relation which should exist between Church and State, and is an excellent book. The work contains eight chapters, as follows:—

> Introduction, The Religion of Jesus, The Powers that Be, The Theocracy of Israel, The State in Particular, A Practical Test, A Brief Notice of The History of the Union Theory, and The Union in England.

We trust the book will have a large sale, for it ought to be read by everybody.
