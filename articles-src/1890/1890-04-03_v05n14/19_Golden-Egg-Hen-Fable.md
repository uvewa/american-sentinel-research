IN a recent article in the *Christian Nation,* Rev. J. M. Foster gives a new version of the fable of the goose which laid the golden egg. He says: "To take the Sabbath for popular temperance meetings is killing the hen which lays the golden egg, .as the foolish woman did in the fable story." We presume that he must have read the "fable story" of this remarkable h*en* and of the foolish woman, in the same book out of which Dr. Stacy obtained his information regarding the "bounding kangaroo," which he described as "springing from his lair" and drawing the life-blood from his victim.
