> "SENATOR BLAIR," says the New York *World, *"writes to a city newspaper that the failure of his Educational bill was due in great measure to the neglect of the metropolitan press to report his speeches. What does he mean? The newspapers of this city have no vote in the Senate. The men who heard his speeches voted against his measure."
