# "Is This a Christian Nation?"

IN a Sunday lecture delivered in Philadelphia, March 2, Rabbi Joseph Krauskopf gives a forcible and logical reply to the question, "Is this a Christian Nation?" He cites the rapid increase of a heterogeneous population as varied in religious belief or unbelief, as in nationality,—the millions of those who do not believe in Christianity at all, unbelievers, Agnostics, ethical culturists, free religionists, Jews, Mohammedans, Confucianists, Buddhists, etc.,—and shows that their presence precludes the possibility of this being either technically or theoretically a Christian Nation, in the National Reform sense of the expression.

In opening his discourse the Rabbi speaks as follows: "In view of the strenuous efforts now being made by some religious organizations, to secure the passage by Congress, of the three religious measures now before it—the Blair Sunday bill, the Breckinridge Sunday bill for the District of Columbia, and the Blair Educational amendment, which provides for the teaching of the principles of Christianity in the public schools—the National Religious Liberty Association, an organization effected to oppose all religious legislation by the civil Government, is exerting its utmost to effect the defeat of these bills. To attain this end, it enlists the support of every liberal preacher, and speaker, and editor. It is represented at Washington by men whose duty it is to oppose the three religious measures now before Congress. It gathers signatures in nearly every State and Territory in the Union, to a petition to the Senate and to the House of Representatives 'Not to pass any bill in regard to the observance of the Sabbath or Lord's day, or any other religious or ecclesiastical institution of right,' etc. By means of such systematic and energetic opposition, the friends of liberty of conscience were enabled to defeat, last year, what was commonly known as the Blair Sunday-rest bill, and the Blair amendment of the Constitution of the United States respecting establishments of religion and free schools, which were, excepting a few slight modifications, the same bills that Senator Blair has again introduced this year.

"Not content with last year's defeat the Senator from New Hampshire is again exerting his utmost, with the aid of hundreds of preachers, and millions of signatures, to foist a Puritanic Sabbath upon the people of the United States, a Sunday law that shall make labor, amusement, the collection and transmission of mail, railway traffic on the 'Lord's day ' punishable as crime, and an amendment to the constitution of the United States, which shall make the teaching of the 'fundamental and non-sectarian principles of Christianity' obligatory in every free public school. To enable the friends of Conscience to achieve another victory, and again to protect the Constitution of the United States from dangerous tamperings, aid is solicited." . . . "I believe that it is high time that every American should understand fully, that here in our country, Church and State are totally separated, that this separation is ineradically engraven upon our Constitution, is interwoven with every fibre of every American freeman, and that, whoever attempts to form, by means of legislation, a link between them, aims at extinguishing the brightest star in the diadem of our glory, he is a traitor to his country, an enemy to his fellow citizens, a violator of the most sacred and the most cherished of all our possessions."

He arraigns the Blair measures before Congress and says: "We know the subterfuge to which the Honorable Mr. Blair has resorted, this year. Last year's bill demanded the teaching of the ' principles of the Christian religion' in the public schools. In this year's bill, he has somewhat altered the phraseology: he demands the teaching ' of the fundamental and non-sectarian principles of Christianity.' The alteration is an ingenious blind, but as illogical as ingenious. 'Fundamental non-sectarian principles of Christianity,' are contradictory terms. The fundamental principles of Christianity, must necessarily involve the divinity of Christ, and this involves a mass of specifically Christian beliefs and doctrines."

The address closes with this paragraph: "I am glad that a National Religious Liberty Association has been organized, [111] and that it is preparing for an active opposition. Let us give them whatever aid we can. Let us gather all the signatures we can for their petition to Congress. Let us show that we can oppose the Church and yet be friends of education and religion. Let us show that we can be loyal to the Constitution, without being hostile to the Bible; that we can separate the two, without making either the one or the other the loser by the severance. Let us insist upon our religious liberties. Let us insist that ecclesiastical property shall not be exempt from just taxation; that chaplains shall not be employed by the Government; that neither the President of the United States, nor the Governors of the various States shall appoint religious festivals or fasts; that Puritanic Sabbath laws shall be repealed; that the Bible shall be excluded from the public schools; that no exclusive privilege shall be conceded, in any department of the National or State Government to Christianity or any other special religion; that this is not a Christian Government, nor a Government of any other denomination, but a 'Government of *all *the people, and for *all* the people, and by *all* the people.'" W. H. M.
