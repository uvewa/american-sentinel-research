# Religious Intolerance.

As a representative of the National Religious Liberty Association, the writer attended the March term of the Circuit Court, at Troy, Tennessee, to witness the trial of one R. M. King, indicted for working on Sunday. Mr. King is a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, a sect which, like the Seventh-day Baptists, observes the seventh day (Saturday) as the Sabbath, instead of Sunday, believing the seventh, and not the first day of the week, to be the day of divine appointment.

The indictment against Mr. King reads as follows:—

## Indictment *vs.* R. M. KING.

> The Grand Jurors of the State of Tennessee, elected, empanelled, sworn and charged to inquire in and for the body of the County of Obion, in the State aforesaid, upon their oath present that R. M. King, late of said County, laborer, heretofore, to wit: on the 23rd day of June, A. D. 1889, and on divers other Sundays before and after that date, and up to the taking of this requisition, in the County of Obion aforesaid, then and there did unlawfully and unnecessarily engage in his secular business, and performed his common avocation of life, to wit: plowing on Sunday, and did various other kinds of work on that day and on Sundays before that day, without regard to said Sabbath days. Said work was not necessary, nor done as a matter of charity; and the doing of said work on said day was and is a disturbance to the community in which done, was offensive to the moral sense of the public, and was and is a common nuisance. So the Grand Jurors aforesaid present and say that said R. M. King was in manner and form aforesaid guilty of a public nuisance by such work on Sunday in a public place, prejudicial to public morals, contrary to the statute, and against the peace and dignity of the State.

> J. R. BOND,
> Att’y-Gen.
Five witnesses were called for the State, and one for the defense. The first witness examined was J. L. Cole, who was also the prosecutor in the case. He testified that he had seen Mr. King plowing in his field on Sunday on one occasion. There was a public neighborhood road on two sides of the field in which the plowing was done, but the field was not in sight of any place of public worship. He did not see the defendant plowing for more than five minutes. On cross-examination the following questions were put to the witness by [103] Colonel Richardson, the defendant’s counsel, and drew from the witness the answers as given:—

> *Col. R.*—Did you see the defendant, Mr. King, working on Sunday?

> *Mr. Cole.*— Yes, sir; I saw him plowing in his field on Sunday, the twenty-third day of June last.
> *Col. R.*— Did it disturb you in any way?
> *Mr. Cole.*— Yes, sir, of course it did; it was very annoying to my feelings.
> *Col. R.*— On what grounds?
> *Mr. Cole.*— On the ground that it was a violation of laws both sacred and civil.
> *Col. R.*—Then it was an excitement of your religious feelings, and repulsive to your views of Christianity?
> *Mr. Cole.*—Yes, sir.
> *Col. R.*— How long have you known Mr. King?
> *Mr. Cole.*—For about twenty or twenty-five years.
> *Col. R.*—What was the general character of the defendant as a peaceable, quiet, law-abiding citizen, up to the time of this indictment?
> *Mr. Cole.*—It was good.
> *Col. R.*—Is he a pious, Christian gentleman?
To this question the prosecuting attorney, J. R. Bond, objected, and his objection was sustained by Judge Swiggart, on the ground that it was irrelevant. Whereupon Colonel Richardson made the following plea:—

> Your Honor, I think it is relevant, and I submit to your Honor that I propose to prove that he is a member of a church which holds that Saturday, the seventh day, is the Sabbath, and that he observes it. I think I have a right to do this for two purposes: first, I think I have a right to do it to show that he did not intentionally violate the law; second, I think I have a right to do it to show the intent and purpose for which he did it, as a matter of mitigation. If this action can be sustained at all, and if this jury can find any verdict at all, it is within the discretion and power of the jury to impose any fine above $50 that they may see proper. And I think that as a matter of mitigation I have a right to show to the jury that this man belongs to a church that professes certain tenets of religious faith,— amongst which is that the seventh day is the Sabbath; and that he observed that day as the Sabbath. I think I have a right to prove this,— not, I grant you, as a defense to the action, or as a decision of it, but in mitigation of any fine.

> *The Court.*—I do not think his religious belief or religious connection with any church or sect has anything to do with this lawsuit, and sustain all objections tending to prove anything of that sort.
> *Col. R.*—And your Honor declines to allow me to prove it, even as a matter of mitigation?
> *The Court.*—Yes, sir.
> *Col. R.* (to the witness).—Are you prejudiced against the defendant because of his religious views?
> *Mr. Cole.*— I can say this, that I do not favor his religious views.
Here the Court objected to any further questions on this point from the defense.

Further examination drew from this witness and the one which followed, the fact that the witnesses and certain others had bound themselves by a written pledge or agreement to prosecute every violation of the Sunday law. The defendant offered to prove that others who made no pretensions to observe any other day than Sunday cut wheat with a self-binder, rafted logs, and did other work on Sunday, and that no attempt had been made to prosecute them; but the Court would not allow him to do so.

The cross-examination showed that the third witness, Alexander Wright, was going down to his field to examine his crops the first time he saw Mr. King at work; and on another occasion he and the fourth witness, William Oaks, were on their way to another part of the neighborhood after a cow. The fifth witness was looking up harvest-hands when he saw the defendant at work on Sunday.

The defendant also offered to prove that he had been tried before a Justice of the Peace, and fined for the identical work which was made the principal offense in the indictment, viz.: plowing corn on Sunday, the twenty-third day of June last, and that he had paid his fine and the costs; and introduced for the purpose the Justice before whom he was tried; but the Court would not permit him to prove these facts.

The speech of the prosecuting attorney was a tirade against the religious sect of which the defendant was a member, and a reflection upon northern men, although Mr. King is not a northern man, all of which was well calculated to arouse the prejudices of the jury. It was so saturated with blackguardism that it cannot be repeated. The main effort of the speaker was to confound the defendant and those of his religious faith with the Mormons, and he even charged them with offering human sacrifices. I will give a few extracts from the speech, which are very much modified; for no respectable pen could write the words as spoken, and no respectable ear would want to hear them.

> There were a lot of fellows in the olden time—some Adventists, or Seventh-day Advents, or Mormons, or Mayflower fellows, I do not care which you call them—that believed in human sacrifices, carrying them to the altar and burning them up as an incense. Suppose they should come from the same section of that country, Colonel Richardson would say, “You have no right to interfere with the rights of conscience of this people; and you can’t interfere with them, because the Bill of Rights says that every man in this country has a right to worship God according to the dictates of his conscience.” Burn children, practice polygamy, and everything else of that sort! No, sir; away with all such foolishness, and everything of that sort! I do not care anything about the Adventists, or Mormons, whether they are right or not. But when they come here they must walk up to the rack and eat the same fodder that our folks eat. Not satisfied with worshiping God! Oh no; but with your shorthand reporters, your Mormons, and your Adventists, you want to corrupt not only the whole morals of the country, but you want to control the courts of the country. I wish to God we had more Methodist Churches, and more Baptist Churches, and more Presbyterian Churches, and more EpiscopalChurches, and more Catholic Churches, until every man was brought under the benign influences of these churches; but, in the name of God, I do not want any of these Advent Churches, or Mormon Churches. Guiteau, when he had a revelation from God (and I expect he had a Seventh-day Adventist lawyer to defend him), took a pistol and shot down the ruler of this Nation, and they hung him; and that is what they ought to do with all these fellows. I have no respect for men like that. These fellows never heard from God, and I think they never will. They are not satisfied with working on Sunday and practicing polygamy themselves, they come down here and want to save us, and have us practice polygamy.

The obscene and filthy utterances of the attorney, which we have not quoted, evoked considerable merriment among the visitors in the court-room, the jury, and especially among the leading witnesses for the prosecution, who were devout church members.

The jury was only out about half an hour, when they returned a verdict of guilty, and assessed the fine at $75. The counsel for the defendant took exception to the charge given to the jury, and moved a new trial. In refusing to grant a new trial, the Judge said:—

> The law is clear. I charged it properly. The fine is a reasonable one, and one well warranted, The laws are made to be obeyed; and Mr. King and all other men should and must obey them, or leave the country. I make these remarks that they may know that I intend to have the laws strictly enforced in the future. Mr. King and his brethren have a right to keep another day if they choose, but as Christian men it is their duty to obey the laws of the State, and they must do it.

An appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of the State, and will probably be heard at the April term.

The results of this case prove more clearly than ever the danger of removing a single provision that our fathers wisely put in the Constitution to protect the rights of conscience, and to secure to all perfect religious liberty. And it is not enough to have these safeguards in the Constitution; The statute-books must also be kept clear of laws touching matters that are purely religious. The Bill of Rights of Tennessee is clear and strong as to the rights of conscience; but the statutes are enforced regardless of the Bill of Rights In matters of so much importance we cannot trust to the good will and indulgence of our fellowcitizens. The rights of every citizen in matters of conscience should be recognized fully and distinctly in all constitutions and statute-books, both State and national. Nor can any creed or sect be safe when it is otherwise. No matter how numerous or well protected they may be at the present time, let the precedent once be established of coercing the conscience under the sanction and protection of law, and none can tell what the end will be. In the case above referred to, the witnesses testified that their moral and religious senses and their sense of propriety were shocked. Another citizen of Tennessee, in talking with the writer, said that it would shock his moral sense, and sense of propriety, more to see persons led down into the water and immersed than to see a man quietly plowing in his field on Sunday. Who can say, if the laws would permit it, that there would not be men whose religious senses would be shocked by immersion, by communion in both kinds, or by the opposite of these, till their pent-up religious enthusiasm would seek vent in prosecutions and persecutions. The only tenable ground for a remedy against the evils of religious legislation is to keep the State and the Church forever separate. DAN. T. JONES.

THE act of those riotous women at Lathrop, Missouri, the *Union Signal* approves as “a temperance crusade with practical features and speedy results.” We do not believe in intemperance nor in rioting. Riotous “temperance” is intemperance none the less dangerous than saloon intemperance. These women ought to have been more both womanly and more temperate. They should not have allowed their zeal to get the better of their judgment. [104]

THE Supreme Court of Wisconsin has decided that the reading of the Bible in the public schools is sectarian teaching, and therefore unconstitutional. Judge Bennett’s “representative” decision is therefore reversed.

THE Blair Educational bill was defeated in the Senate March 20, by a vote of thirty-one to thirty-seven. Senator Blair changed his affirmative vote to no and gave notice of a motion to reconsider.

The article in this paper on the bill was in type and “made up” before the bill was defeated; and it will help more to show how richly the bill deserved the everlasting death which we hope has been dealt to it by this vote.

OUR readers will remember that two weeks ago we published a letter from our California correspondent criticising a sermon on Sunday work in one of the California prisons. Referring to this same sermon the San Francisco *Alta* says:—

> A good many interior journals are commenting admiringly on the energetic and righteous indignation with which Rev. Dr. F. A. Horton, of Oakland, recently denounced the practice of working the San Quentin convicts on Sunday. Only one fault can be found with Dr. Horton’s denunciation. The convicts in San Quentin are not worked on Sunday.

This is indeed a serious fault, but we think that our correspondent showed very plainly that it was not the only fault in that sermon.

WE learn from the *Territory Enterprise *that a large and enthusiastic meeting of the citizens of Virginia City, Nevada, was held in the Opera House at that place on the 10th inst., to protest against the passage of the Blair Sunday-rest bill, the Breckinridge Sunday bill, and the proposed Educational amendment to the Constitution of the United States. A part of the resolutions were as follows:—

> *Resolved,* That ... it is not and never should be within the province of the national Congress, or the Legislature of any State in the Union to prescribe for the free public schools what are and what are not the “fundamental and non-sectarian principles of Christianity.”

> *Resolved,* That religion is beyond the purview of human government, and from it is essentially distinct and exempt from its cognizance. That any connection between them is not only injurious to both, but is destructive of personal liberty, freedom of conscience, and the public welfare; and with the patriot soldier, Grant, we affirm that all religions should, for all time, be left to the family altar, the church, and the private school, supported entirely by private contribution, and that the State and the Church should remain forever separate.
The senators and representatives from that State were requested to oppose the adoption of the Blair and Breckinridge measures. The work of the National Religious. Liberty Association was heartily approved.

DR. GOSSLER, Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs and Public Instruction of the German Empire, has, it is said, expressed his approval of the views of Dr. Windhorst, the Catholic leader, that the Church, school, and State ought to work together. Radical changes, he declares, are impending in the field of education. In view of the fact that the late elections in Germany have given the Papists a strong hold upon the Government, enabling them to dictate their own terms to the emperor, the world need be surprised at nothing which may happen in Germany in the way of a return to the methods of the middle ages.

REV. JOSEPH COOK is quoted by the *Christian Statesman* of Feb. 27, as criticising Edward Bellamy’s Nationalism, in his first Boston lecture for 1890, and saying: “It has elements in it that are very Christian; but the Christianity is in the voluntary co-operation, and not in the compulsory Nationalism.” Very true Mr. Cook! The principle of voluntary co-operation, and not of national compulsion, is at the root of all Christianity. In that expression, you have stated a truth of universal application, and one which bears just as hard upon the methods and purposes of the National Reform Association, and Sabbath Union, as upon the doctrines of Mr. Bellamy. Why, then, do you affiliate with these advocates of nationalism in religion?

THE *Christian Statesman,* of March 6, contains the following: “We regret to note that Sabbath, the 23d inst., was openly devoted to lobbying among the members of Congress in favor of the rival cities. The amended Fair bill, imperilled by a shameful struggle for political advantage, passed the New York Legislature on Wednesday, the 19th. Until this was done, New York’s representatives at Washington could do nothing. The Sabbath was one of the four days left before the vote was to be taken. Chauncy M. Depew, Ex-Senator Warner Miller, Elliott F. Shepard and others, hastened to Washington. We cannot say to what extent the Christian men in this delegation were responsible for the fact, or were implicated in it, but the newspapers of Monday bore evidence that no other day of the four was more diligently employed in pushing the claims of New York, than was the Sabbath. On the evening of that day, a dinner was given by Representative Flower, where the plans for the week were carefully looked over again, and close calculations made, as to the result of the vote.”

Already it seems the religious press has begun its censorship, and among those who fall under its displeasure, is the unfortunate president of the Sabbath Union itself. Elliott F. Shepard has been in bad company, and the *Christian Statesman *throws the first stone. He has soiled the immaculate dignity of his office by coming to Washington on the same train with Chauncy Depew and others, who, according to the newspapers, must have talked about the World’s Fair on Sunday. A New York Representative gave a dinner too, and these bad men all ate together on Sunday, and planned how to get the World’s Fair. If only the Breckinridge Sunday bill had been a law, the *Statesman* might have had legal redress for the “disturbance” of its Sunday rest in Philadelphia, by these New York Sundaybreakers in Washington.

A GENTLEMAN in Florence, Ontario, sends us a postal card, from which we make the following extract:—

> You seem to think that God requires some help from some of his creatures to maintain his kingdom upon earth. I pray that the United States may be so fortunate as to get a civil statute to protect the first day of the week as the Christian Sabbath.

We cannot see why the gentleman should imagine that *we* think that God needs some help “to maintain his kingdom upon earth.” That is the position occupied by those who are endeavoring to give him the help of the civil law. The Sabbath is a divine institution, and it belongs to God. If Sunday is the Sabbath, it certainly needs no other law than the law of God to maintain it. God needs no aid from the civil power to maintain the dignity of his government. But the National Reformers are insisting that he does, and that this Government shall give it to him.

THE member of Congress who presented the local Sunday bill for the District of Columbia, in the House of Representatives, said, in an address in New York, as quoted in “Sabbath Reform Document” of January 9:—

> The State owes it to itself and to its present citizens, and to the generations that are yet to come, to protect this day, on precisely the same grounds that they protect the martial relation.

This member proposes to protect the day, by a law “to prevent persons from being forced to labor on Sunday.” At the next session of Congress, then, we may expect him to introduce a bill “to prevent persons from being forced to violate the marital relation.” [105]
