# Recreation and Religion.

A SCOTCH parish minister has been discussing the rival claims of football and religious worship. He finds that some of the athletic youth in his congregation have been so wearied by their exertions at the football matches on the Saturday, that they could not come out to church on Sunday morning. The remedy he proposes for this state of matters sounds very like revolution in Scotch religious ideas. He proposes that the football match should be postponed till the Sunday afternoon, and that his young people should have their worship first and their enjoyment afterwards. He defends his proposal by the observation that, etymologically, religion and recreation mean the same thing. We are not so sure about that, but the fact that such a suggestion is made by a minister in Scotland proves that Scotland is moving forward perhaps, fast enough. Twenty-five years ago another Scotch minister was the subject of universal reprobation in Scotland because he suggested that a quiet walk on Sunday might be a good thing. Now we have football on Sunday recommended. Scotland is advancing.—*London Daily Graphic.*
