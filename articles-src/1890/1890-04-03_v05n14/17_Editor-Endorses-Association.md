THE editor of a prominent paper in a western city writes: "Having read, in this week's issue of the AMERICAN SENTINEL, the Declaration of Principles and objects of your Association, I am in hearty sympathy with them. . ... The advocates of the different forms of religious legislation are many, and prompt and effective work should be done to educate as to the true scope of civil government, and the duty and the right of the individual to worship according to the dictates of his conscience. I wish your Association Godspeed in its worthy work." [112]
