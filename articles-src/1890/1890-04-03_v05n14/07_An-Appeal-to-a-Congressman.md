UNDER the above heading the Rev. H. B. Maurer, a Baptist pastor in this State, has written a pointed communication, from which we make the following extract:—

Respected Sir:—As a Baptist, I have additional reasons to those that I am a Republican and one of your constituents, for asking you to use your influence to prevent the passage of the Breckinridge bill, now pending at Washington. By arts, unworthy of religious men, that bill is made to appear non-religious, and therefore constitutional; and before proving that it is neither, pray let me remind you that from religious legislation we Baptists, as history shows, have in times past been the greatest sufferers; that the union of Church and State having proved a curse to Europe, our ancestors wisely formed a national Constitution on the principle of rendering to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. . . .

As for the "civil Sabbath," there can be no such thing. Sabbath observance is a duty we owe to God and not to man; it is a subjective matter entirely; while things civil have to do only with the State, and our relations man to man. In God's law it finds a place where the duties toward him are defined, and in no other relation can it be placed, while things which we call civil are in that part of the law where man's relations to man, society, and the State, are defined. The laws of our land rightly may have to do with stealing, adultery, murder, false witness, etc., as these are civil matters, but I deny, sir, that they can have anything to do with idolatry, blasphemy, or Sabbath observance, as these are not civil matters, and have to do only with the relations between man and his Maker.

As for the sanitary Sabbath, another piece of sophism to secure religious legislation, I deny the right of the law of the land to define how much, or just when, a man shall rest. I deny that it should say I shall and must rest one day in seven because it is good for me, as I would deny its right to say that I must bathe once a day, or once in every seven days; or that I should refrain from eating pork, or mixing pickles with my ice-cream, because thus to bathe or thus to refrain is good for me. I prefer to receive such instruction from my physician and not from Congress nor the American Sabbath Union.

Sabbath observance can and must be secured through education and persuasion only, and not by coercion. The gospel persuades men to reverence sacred things from motives of love, and not to compel them by force; therefore to do by law what ought to be done by the gospel is anti- Christian. Let the church members and ministers refuse to patronize Sunday cars and Sunday newspapers if they believe that day sacred; let the former in their homes, and the latter from their pulpits, educate the people to reverence what they believe sacred, but let these ministers not be allowed to put upon Congress and the courts the work for which they are paid. Their position is practically saying, "We are a failure, we cannot do what we are commissioned to do; help us to earn our salaries." Such work belongs to the churches, and to them only, and it would be taking a long step backward if more laws were added to the iniquitous laws now found among our State statutes, which have never helped the Sabbath anywhere; for what Sabbath observance there is results not from civil statutes but from religious training.

Now, sir, the question may arise why I, a resident of New York, should be so opposed to a proposed law affecting the District of Columbia only. Simply because I see in this, another scheme to secure more extended legislation. It is like the camel which got his nose first into the tent. Let this bill pass, and Congress will have established a precedent; and as surely as day follows night, a national bill will follow, and it will be the Blair bill, already awaiting its turn.
