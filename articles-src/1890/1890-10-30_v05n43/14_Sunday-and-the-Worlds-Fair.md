# Sunday and the World’s Fair.

THE question of closing the World’s Fair on Sunday is being agitated at the present time. It is insisted by a numerous and influential class of citizens that the Columbian Exposition to be held in Chicago in 1893, shall be closed to all the world on Sunday.

It is not the purpose of this leaflet to discuss whether the Fair shall or shall not be closed on Sunday, but to inquire what motive prompts the making of such a demand. On what ground is the demand that the Fair be closed on Sunday, based? Why not ask that it be closed on Monday? or why ask that it be closed on any day?

Sunday is regarded by a large majority of Christians as a religious day, and from these, and for religious reasons, comes the demand that the Fair be closed on Sunday. This is the reason the demand is made,—their religious views of the character of the day. The demand, then, is made by a class of religious people, from religious motives, and for religious ends. To their religious views they certainly have a right; but when it is insisted that the religious views of some, even though they be largely in the majority, shall be made a rule of action for all, another question at once arises,—

## Can A Land Of Religious Liberty Enforce Religious Views?

The World’s Fair is not a religious concern. Others beside those who regard Sunday as a sacred day will visit it, and contribute to its support and success. Thousands may wish to attend it on Sunday who will not have an opportunity to do so on other days. Should the Fair be kept open, those who regard Sunday religiously need not visit it on that day. Their action in the matter would depend solely on their own choice. But to demand that the World’s Fair shall be closed to all the world on Sunday, because some good people regard that day religiously, is unreasonable. What right have those who regard the hours of Sunday as holy time, to dictate how or where those who do not so regard them shall or shall not spend their time? With all respect to religion, it must be said that when its devotees assume such an attitude, they are taking unwarrantable ground.

This demand is not made in the interests of the Fair, or of the Nation, but to secure national sanction to certain religious views. It is prompted by the same spirit which demands a national Sunday law, and an establishment by law of a national religion. But—

## Is Civil Government The Proper Conservator Of Religion ?

The object of civil government is not to make its citizens religious, but civil. Religion pertains to a man’s obligations to God and his well-being in another world. Civil governments are instituted to protect men in their rights in this world. It is not the province of religion to run civil governments. The Church has never assumed control of the State without persecution quickly following in its train. Forgetting their high calling, religionists have sometimes made it their chief business to meddle with worldly affairs, and sought to place civil governments on a religious basis; but all such efforts have invariably proved disastrous, both to religion and the governments.

The success of Christianity does not depend upon the closing of the Columbian Exposition on Sunday. Christianity is a great deal larger than Columbia or the Exposition, and Sunday-keeping is not all there is to Christianity. Christians differ as to which day is the Sabbath, some claiming the first, and others the seventh day of the week, and it is not the province of the Government to say which is right.

Aside from divine revelation, the strongest argument any one can make in favor of the day he regards as sacred is for him to keep it. The consistent course for those churches to pursue which regard Sunday as sacred time, is for them to prohibit their members from attending the Fair on that day, and discipline those who do. This they may do, and this is as far as they can consistently go. The membership of a church is the extent of its jurisdiction. It is not the business of churches to demand of nations, States, or principalities, that everybody shall be required to conform to their ideas and customs in religious matters. Any attempt in this direction is but a step toward a union of Church and State.—*N. R. L. A. Leaflet.*

THE State is not an exhorter, or a pursuader, or a debating club, but a positive law power for secular purposes; and hence, when it attempts to administer religion, it must of necessity give to it the law force, deciding what religion is true, and by what method it shall be promoted. There is no escape from this result, if we admit the principle from which it springs. *—Samuel T. Spear, D. D. *[327-328]

REFERRING to the Lutheran declaration that the “underlying principle of the Bennett law is needless interference with parental rights and liberty of conscience,” *America* says:—

> The best refutation of this false charge is to be found in the fact that, although the law has been in force nearly two years, there has not been a single prosecution under its provisions.

Indeed, simply because a law is not enforced it is a just and humane law! It must be then that the Tennessee Sunday law was a perfectly righteous statute, till R. M. King was arrested and fined under it, simply to gratify the intolerance of his bigoted neighbors. Strange logic, that!

THE “Metropolitan Church and Choir Directory,” for 1890, gives the number of churches in New York and Brooklyn as 759. This is an item of importance, as well as interest, when it is considered that effort is now being made to show the strength of the churches as a factor in local politics in the city of New York. How long is it possible for the Church to exert itself in politics in New York City, without becoming a full-rigged political machine? Have the political bosses in the past shown themselves too highminded to steal the livery of the Church to serve their master the devil, and Mammon, in? Certainly this is what they will do the very hour these noble-purposed, but mistaken gentlemen succeed in making the Church a political power.

THE *Christian Statesman,* of August 7, has the following, which is interesting, especially in view of some of the so-called arguments in favor of compulsory Sabbath keeping:—

> A well informed authority says that Columbia College, New York, is largely carried on for the benefit of the Jews. Thay take five times as many prizes, in proportion to their numbers, as other classes; and in the annex to Columbia College, seventy per cent of the pupils are Jewesses. The Jews control journalism in Germany, and are very largely influential in journalism all over the world.

This ought, certainly, to disprove the claim so confidently made in justification of Sunday laws, namely, that a regular day of rest is a physical necessity, and that in order for a portion of the community to take the necessary rest all must rest. The Jews do not rest habitually on Sunday, and it must be confessed that but few of them observe with any degree of strictness any other day; yet it is a fact that in point of both mental and physical vigor they excel. This fact, coupled with like facts concerning the Japanese, a people who keep no rest day, ought to effectually dispose of the fiction that a regular weekly rest is a *physical* necessity.

WE find the following in an exchange, credited “*Voice;”* we doubt if it is from the paper of that name published in this city, but it may be:—

> For our part we want to see less useless and hopeless tinkering with the Federal Constitution, and more of an effort to secure a government in conformity with the spirit of that still grand document. The changes the people of America most need are not changes in the Constitution. That is about the only thing left in our Government to be proud of.

We, too, believe that our Constitution is as nearly perfect as it can be made, certainly much more nearly so than it would be if amended according to the programme of the various and numerous Constitution tinkers. Let it remain as it is; and obey it as it is.

IT has been proved by actual demonstration in Boston, that Sunday opening of their Museum of Fine Arts is appreciated by the general public. A writer in the *Independent,* of this city, says:—

> The Boston Museum gives free admission to visitors two days in the week, Saturdays and Sundays. On Saturdays the average number of visitors last year was 776. The Museum is open on Sunday afternoons from one till five, at hours not conflicting with church services. The average number of Sunday admissions last year was 1,317.

The admissions for four hours Sunday afternoons, were almost double that of the ten hours of Saturdays,—though both are free days.

If the museums are designed to be instructors of the people, why not give laboring men and women the benefit of them without at the same time requiring them to make a financial sacrifice, which they must do if they go upon working days?

PRESIDENT WOODRUFF, on September 24, published a manifesto denying that plural marriages were still solemnized in Utah, and saying:—

> Inasmuch as laws have been enacted by Congress forbidding plural marriages, which laws have been pronounced constitutional by the court of last resort, I do hereby declare my intention to submit to those laws and use all my influence with the members of the church, over which I preside, to have them do likewise. There is nothing in my teaching to the church or in those of my associates during the time specified, which can reasonably be construed to inculcate or encourage polygamy, and when any elder of the church has used language which appeared to convey such teaching lie has been promptly reproved; and I now publicly declare that my advice to the Latter-Day Saints is to refrain from contracting any marriage forbidden by the law of the land.

On the 6th inst., the Mormon Conference, in session in Salt Lake, resolved by a unanimous vote to sustain President Woodruff in his action in abolishing polygamy. Not a dissenting voice was heard in the entire assembly of 10,000 persons.

Many will still doubt the sincerity of the Mormons in thus renouncing polygamy, and the Government will doubtless still keep them under surveillance for some time to come, or until they bring forth in this respect “fruits meet for repentance;” but so long as the Mormons abstain from plural marriages the Government cannot properly treat them differently from other religionists. Polygamy is rightfully prohibited by civil law, but aside from the practice of polygamy, the Mormons have just the same rights as the Catholics and the National Reformers, whom they resemble in their ideas of Church and State.

THE September *Arena* has an article from Thomas P. Gorman, in which, enumerating the grave problems which confront Canadian statesmen, the writer says;—

> Then as to the separate school question, the Legislature of Manitoba has passed an act abolishing the existing school system in that province,—which is similar to that of Ontario,—and substituting therefor a public school system such as prevails in the American States. Although the British North American Act, the Constitution of the country, expressly declares that provincial legislatures have not the right to deprive the Protestant minority in Quebec, or the Roman Catholic minorities in other provinces, of any rights or privileges, with respect to education, which they enjoyed at the time of the union; the Manitoba Legislature, backed no doubt by popular opinion in the province, has undertaken to do something which the Constitution declares it shall not do. Not only does the British North American Act prohibit the local legislature from interfering with the separate school system, but it expressly declares that, in the event of that legislature failing to provide the money and machinery necessary for the carrying out of such a system, then the federal Parliament shall intervene and supply whatever is wanting. Then a new party has been formed in Ontario for the purpose of securing for that province full control of educational matters in that province, including the right of abolishing the separate school system.

Thus it appears that the mistaken zeal which leads men, calling themselves Protestants, to violate charters for the sake of gaining advantage not only in politics, but in religious propaganda, is not confined to the United States.

ANY one who can give any information concerning the whereabouts of John N. .Fearon, who was in Colorado when last heard from (ten years ago), will be *duly rewarded* for his trouble by addressing his mother, Sarah B. Fearon, 409 E. Main Street, Lock Haven, Pa. [329]
