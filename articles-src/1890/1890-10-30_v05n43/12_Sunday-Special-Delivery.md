POSTMASTER VAN COTT has resolved to carry out the purposes of the special delivery system on Sundays as well as on other days. He considers that the public, which pays for special delivery, is entitled to it at all proper times. Hitherto it has been the custom to send out special delivery letters on Sunday morning only, by the first carriers leaving the General Post Office at 7 o'clock. In future all special delivery letters will be sent to the persons addressed in this city on Sunday up to the evening hour. This will enable those who desire to communicate with friends on important business on Sunday afternoon, and feel willing to pay the extra fee, to have their letters delivered as they desire.
