UPON President Woodruff's promise that the Mormons will obey the anti-polygamy laws of Congress, the *Christian Advocate *remarks:—

> Mormonism has such a bad reputation that promises to obey are suspected of covering a plan to disobey. But we are inclined to think they mean this; if so, or if not so, let them be watched. If they break no laws in this country, they have the same right to be Mormons as others have to be Roman Catholics, Spiritualists, or Methodists.

This is in refreshing contrast with the utterances of some papers which insist, not only that polygamy, but that *Mormonism* must be stamped out. But all of Mormonism, except the practice of plural marriages, has just the same right not only to exist, but to be protected, that any other ism has, and it will be a sad day for the country when this fact ceases to be recognized.
