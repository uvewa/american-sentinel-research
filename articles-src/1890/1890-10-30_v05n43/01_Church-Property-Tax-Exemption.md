A SOUTHERN paper complains that "the common council of Augusta, Georgia, has resolved to exempt from taxation a large private bridge, that had been constructed by a land company, on the ground that it was a public convenience." And why not? Church property is exempted from taxation on the ground that churches more or less directly benefit the State. If there is any force in the argument why not carry the exemption of property to its logical conclusion, and exempt it all?
