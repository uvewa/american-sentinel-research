WITH that which its name indicates to be the legitimate work of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union we have ever been in the most hearty sympathy. But we regret to say that the Union has not always confined itself to Christian temperance work; it has turned aside into politics, and instead of relying for success upon the power of God as manifested through the gospel, it has invoked the power of the State to enforce what it understands to be Christian duty. In short, neglecting the power of the gospel, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union has allowed lust for political power to become its ruling spirit. This has been a source of sincere regret to us, as it has been to other friends of Christian temperance work, and we have from time to time, as we have observed these digressions, criticised the Union. Nor are we alone in this. This same lust for power has lead the Union to demand an important change in the fundamental law of the Methodist Church, and to accompany that demand by a threat of establishing a rival church. This threat the *Christian Advocate*, of this city, makes the occasion of administering a rebuke to these good women, quite as sharp as any criticism that we have ever made. We reprint, for the information of our readers, the following somewhat lengthy extract from the *Advocate's* article:—

## The Woman's Christian Temperance Union.

With the history of this powerful organization we have been familiar from its beginning, nor has it ever been referred to in the *Christian Advocate* except in words of commendation. To its internal controversies no reference has been made; none of its principles or proceedings have been criticised, directly or indirectly, in this paper. Its editor has on various occasions presided at its meetings, introduced its speakers, and served it according to his measure and the desire of its members.

In his capacity as a member of the General Conference of 1880 he strenuously opposed the granting of permission to Miss Frances E. Willard to address the Conference—not because she was a woman—for he has listened to her, spoken on the same platform with her, and never has been opposed to women speaking in public on religion or any other subject in the proper time and place. The opposition was upon these grounds, that she did not represent an ecclesiastical body; her admission would require the admission of representatives of another similar association; and that there were a large number of non-ecclesiastical bodies desiring to obtain admission. On these principles he has ever acted, both in the Annual and the General Conference, opposing the admission of men on the same grounds, and is ready to do so again in any ecclesiastical executive or legislative body of which he may be a member.

But it now becomes necessary to show that the Woman's Christian Temperance Union has adopted female suffrage as a principle in both State and Church, and that it discusses and as an *organization *has committed itself to the promotion of changes in the Methodist Episcopal Church, using its societies, which obtain access to [340] our churches and congregations on the ground of its temperance and other moral reformatory work, to interfere with the management of the said church.

The evidence of the truth of this statement is now to be submitted. Its *State *Conventions are in the habit of passing resolutions commending female suffrage; its *National* Conventions have done the same. It is so closely connected with the original Female Suffrage Association that the assistant editor of the *Woman's Journal*, Alice Stone Blackwell, is also the Assistant Superintendent of the Department of *Franchise* of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. (One of the principal text-books, if not the chief, in the Department of Franchise in the Woman's Christian Temperance Union is John Stuart Mill's *Subjection of Woman*, whose author repudiated Christianity as a supernatural religion, and on various occasions denounced it as an oppressor of women.) Female suffrage has become one of its chief corner-stones, so that temperance and its allied moral questions, according to the prophet whom we heard in San Francisco, are now made the draft-horses to bear the female suffrage movement onward.

In harmony with this partnership we find a long article in the *Woman's Journal*, organ of the old-line Female Suffragists, for September 13:—

> This is a subject of great moment, not only to the church in which the important action is to be taken, but also to the cause of woman's emancipation in all its various phases. All the friends of woman's advancement, whatever their religious views may be, should do their utmost to rouse those upon whom the decision devolves to an active and intelligent interest in the question....

> The resolution does not involve the question of licensing and ordaining woman to preach, but the relation of women to the legislative councils of the church will eventually determine their positions and privileges in the ministry.

Great is the change which has taken place in the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and most interesting is the method by which it has been brought about. When these ideas—never thought of in the incipiency of the organization—were first broached, some who were positively and uncompromisingly opposed to them were gradually displaced; others who were more malleable were surrounded by "an influence," were spoken of as "true and good," but as "not having yet seen the heavenly vision which had been revealed" to the leaders. If in process of time they saw this vision, according to their gifts and usefulness they rose; but if they still continued in darkness, gradually they were frozen out until it came to be understood that only those who hold these principles and adhere to them should be admitted, whatever their interest in temperance and the reformation of men, to important positions. Hence it has come to pass that this organization is an active propagandizing power for woman suffrage and allied questions.

We have now to show that the *Union Signal*, its *official* organ, loses no opportunity of discussing the Methodist Episcopal Church and its movements in relation to the ecclesiastical position of women.

The attempt is made to connect the deaconess movement in our church with the ordination of women in the ministry. Observe this, and a declaration of the faith of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union in the following, taken from a recent copy of that paper:—

> The training school for Deaconesses in Chicago, under the care of Mrs. Lucy Rider Meyer, is on a broad plane, and deserves the study of all interested in this great problem. *Its evolution will naturally conduct to the final emancipation of woman, by which she will enter the pulpit on the same plane with her brother man,* and they two will prove that, inspired by the Spirit of the Highest, they are adequate to the conversion of the world; that life in wickedness can never be saved by the ministrations of one-half the unit. This is the faith of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, firmly held and frankly stated:

Various of its organizations passed resolutions condemning the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church by *name* for its rejection, on a point of law, of women from membership in the last General Conference;—in one instance classing it in a paragraph of condemnation with certain liquor dealers.

Soon after the adjournment of that General Conference the National Convention of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union was held in the Metropolitan Opera House, in the city of New York, and at that Miss Frances E. Willard delivered her annual address as President, from which we quote what to us is an astonishing passage. Quoting what persons have said to her, she said:—

> "Stay in the church, and help reform it," says one "No; that is impossible; old churches and old parties are equally crystallized," comes the reply. *"Let the Woman's Christian Temperance Union organize a church;* and we will join it, every man of us," is the declaration of *an influential group of earnest men.* "No, we have too many churches already," objects a listener; "let the wheat and tares grow together until the harvest."...

> But for myself I love my mother-church so well, and recognize so thoroughly that the base and body of the great pyramid she forms are broader than its apex, that I would fain give her a little time in which to deal justly by the great household of her loving, loyal, and devoted daughters. I would wait four years longer in fervent hope and prayer that the great body of her ministers and of her membership may make it manifest to all the world that the church of Lady Huntingdon, Barbara Heck, and Phebe Palmer does not hesitate to march with the progressive age it has done so much to educate, nor fear to carry to their logical sequence its life-long teachings as to woman's equality within the house of God. I say this frankly, from my present outlook, though *so often urged,* and not a little tempted, and sometimes quite determined to take a new departure. The time will come, however, *and not many years from now,* when, if presentation is still denied us, it will be our solemn duty to raise once more the cry, "Here I stand, I can do no other," and step out into the larger liberty of a religious movement where majorities and not minorities shall determine *the fitness of women as delegates,* and where the laying on of hands in consecration, as was undoubtedly done in the early Church, shall be decreed on a basis of "gifts, graces, and useful ness," irrespective of sex."

[The italics in the above quotation are the *Advocate's*.]

This is a professedly undenominational body, and it has had remarkable assistance from the Methodist Episcopal Church in resolutions passed by the General Conference, in the use of church buildings, and in the giving of its notices by the pastors. When the Woman's Christian Temperance Union discusses the church in this way, and in such a spirit, *after* it had submitted the question to a vote of its ministers and members, and interferes by a declaration which has the force of a threat, we are compelled to say, that—while it shows how many are the ramifications of this movement—it does *not* furnish ground for the presumption that the legislation or the real interest of the Methodist Episcopal Church would be benefited if the change called for were made.

It must be true, for Miss Willard declares it, that "an influential group of earnest men have called upon the Woman's Christian Temperance Union 'to organize a church!'" It is not wonderful that such things should affect the judgment of the recipient of such confidence.

If such a spirit exists, the church should know it. With genuine admiration for Miss Willard's gifts, and full recognition of her varied services, but with the faithfulness of friendship, we assure her, that were the Woman's Christian Temperance Union to attempt to "organize a church," that "group of influential men" would fail to stand by it or her, and if they did the organization would simply add another to the successors of Jonah's gourd, instead of continuing a growing power for good.

It is a matter of astonishment and grief to us, that our old friend, Professor Luther T. Townsend, whose intellectual gifts and personal character we have always admired, should strengthen such dangerous advisers by writing thus in his article on "Woman in the Pulpit," addressed to and published by Miss Willard:—

> These noble women should knock only once more at the doors of the Methodist General Conference, and if their signals and entreaties are again uncivilly disregarded, they should never knock again; they should call together some of the noblest Christian women of the land, and in solemn convocation, by the laying on of hands and by prayer, they should set apart for pulpit and parish work those who trust that they are inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost to take upon themselves the office of the ministry of the Church of Christ, to serve God, for the promoting of his glory and the edifying of his people.... When that step is taken, if these women are willing to extend an invitation, they will be surprised at the number of clergymen who, with a noble Wesleyan spirit, will hasten to render assistance at the ordination.

It is such passages which have, as we regret to have to say, led the justly distinguished and worthily loved woman into such utterance as this quoted from her annual address of 1888.

In Miss Willard's address in 1889 at the National Convention she called for a resolution [341] asking "the laymen of the Methodist Episcopal Church, who will in the fall of 1890 take action on the question of making women eligible as delegates to the General Conference, to 'do as they would be done by,' and the lay women to remember that ' there is neither male nor female in Christ Jesus,' and 'who would be free, himself must strike the blow.'"

But a larger scheme of a Woman's Council has been devised, the attempt being made to induce all woman's societies, such as the Woman's Foreign and Home Missionary Societies, to send delegates so as to come under the influence of the same principles. The King's Daughters also were solicited to join the Council, that young and old might be indoctrinated with these aspirations and ambitions.

It is due to *many* private members of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and a *few* remaining leaders in State organizations to say they do not agree with these views. Many of them, however, have not fully awakened to the real condition.

Our readers may now *in part* see what is the meaning of the movement. If the Methodist Episcopal Church in the first quarter of its second century desires to become a "Woman's Christian Temperance Union" Church, or a mere adjunct to that organization, it needs only to proceed in the direction to which it is urged.
