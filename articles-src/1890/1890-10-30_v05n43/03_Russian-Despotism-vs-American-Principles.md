A LATE London dispatch states that as a result of the irritation aroused in Russia by the cordial and closer relations between Austria and Germany, the German language is prohibited on public signs over shops, and its teaching forbidden in the schools. The arguments in justification of these repressive measures are substantially the same as are used in Wisconsin in support of the Bennett law. "The Germans live in Russia," it is urged, "and it is their duty to know the language in which the laws are printed." "If they want to be Germans," say the Russian officials, "let them pack up and go over into Germany." In Russia this is despotism; in the United States, it is by some supposed to be Americanism.
