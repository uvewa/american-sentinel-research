# A Correction.

WE have received the following letter, which we take it is designed for publication. We cheerfully give it place:—

> Merrill, Wisconsin, Oct. 18, 1890.

> EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL: "They Agree on the Main Point," is one of the articles in your last paper. Therein is stated that also the *Protestants *hold that, "as a Nation we ought to see to it that our youth receive religious instruction." Commonly the Lutherans are also called Protestants. According to this, your statement, the Lutherans also would be in favor of religious teaching by the State. But this is not so. We Lutherans, or better, we German Lutherans, do not ask such a thing of the State or Nation; on the contrary, we believe in a total separation of Church and State. We never asked nor will ask the State or Nation for any such thing. You have judged *all* Protestants ac. cording to the views expressed in the *Christian Statesman.* You forgot or did not know that this paper is not representing the views of *all* Protestants, not even on this subject. There are, no doubt, Protestants favoring such religious instruction, but they are not Lutherans. The Lutherans deny the right "of any civil government to legislate on religious questions. And on this principle we are making the fight against the Bennett law. We perfectly agree with you on this principle, and are glad to have such an able paper as yours working for such a noble end.

> To me, personally, your paper has always been of great interest, and I wish you the greatest success.

> Please correct your statement, and oblige all Lutherans.

> Yours truly.

> H. DAIB.

We must confess to some inaccuracy in statement, in the first part of the article referred to. We should have said in the outset, as we did in the latter part of our article, "many Protestants," etc. We had in mind only those Protestants who demand that some measure of religious instruction shall be given by the teachers in the public schools. We are ourselves Protestants, and are well aware that *all *Protestants are not in favor of teaching religion in schools supported by the State.
