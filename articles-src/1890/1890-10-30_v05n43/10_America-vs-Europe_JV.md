[THE following lines—written some thirty years ago—depict from the standpoint of liberty the principles on which the United States Government was founded as compared with the principles of the European governments. The author is Count A. de Gasparin, a fearless advocate of liberty, and a warm admirer of the American institutions This extract is translated from the author's French work; "Un grand Peuple que se Releve," and may serve to awaken new love and vigilance for the immortal boon of religious and civil liberty.

JOHN VUILLEUMEIR.]

THE United States is not a Latin nation; a nation clad in the robes of a Roman or Greek civilization; a nation having according to the ancient fashion, a religion and a set of customs blindly admitted by all. This Republic of the New World is not at all one of the republics of the ancient continent, where the citizens loved to talk about public affairs, but where nobody was foolish enough to raise questions of conscience respecting the public belief, pagan life,—with its compulsory worship, its uniform education, its suppression of the family and the individual for the benefit of the State; pagan life,—where the citizen supersedes the individual, and where the calm uniformity of the ages gives every one a national mold,—has no likeness to moral and social life in the United States.

Here you will not find the least vestige of that system which tries to make nations, and forgets to make men. These States can truly be said to have originated out of a protest of the human conscience. How many things are explained by this noble origin! Yes, it was the reaction of religious independence against compulsory uniformity and against the State church, that created this country, two hundred years ago. I do not need, here, to examine the intrinsic truth of the Puritan belief; I simply affirm that it landed in America in the name of liberty, and that its mission here was to establish liberty, and to build the true wall against democratic tyrannies.

At the very outset, the State was denied the direction of the intellectual and moral man. Notwithstanding the unavoidable inconsistencies and hesitancies which attend all our beginnings, the Colonies, which were to become the United States, were walking steadily on the road which leads to liberty of belief, of thought, of speech, of press, of association, of teaching. The highest, the most important rights, were stripped, at the very start, from the province of democratic deliberations; insuperable limits were laid to the sovereignty of majorities; the rights of minorities, of the individual, the right of standing alone against all, the right of being of one's own opinion, was distinctly affirmed.

More than that, it was not very long before the bands between Church and State were completely severed, thus destroying the last pretext for the official administration of belief; *self-government* was founded, that is to say, the most explicit denial of democratic bondage. While democracy pleads for a maximum of government, American individualism pleads for a minimum of government, the *par excellence* definition of liberalism. And it did not contemplate bringing this about, as in the Middle Ages, through anarchy, absence of national ties, and by depriving the individual of his rights of conscience and thought; no, American individualism has other means of action; while restraining with a wise energy the province of government to its true limits, it was enlarging all the more the purview of the human soul.

Grand conquest that was! The whole future of our modern world is there contained.
