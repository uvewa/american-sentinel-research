"CALIFORNIA is the only State in the Union without some form of Sunday law, or legal rest-day," is the plaintive wail of the Sunday-law advocates. But do they not know that a man may legally rest in California whenever he has a mind so to do? And as a matter of fact as large a proportion of the population of that State do rest from their ordinary avocations on Sunday, as in States having Sunday laws. It is not true that in America a lack of Sunday laws "leads to Sunday slavery of the masses."
