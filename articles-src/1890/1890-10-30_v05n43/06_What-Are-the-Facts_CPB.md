IN 1885 Rev. W. F. Crafts published his book, "The Sabbath for Man," in which he relates that in order to obtain a world-wide view of Sabbath observance he corresponded with more than two hundred persons residing in nearly every nation of the world. One of the questions which he asked was:—

> Where have you seen the best Sabbath observance?

To this, a San Francisco pastor responded:—

> Among the Christian people of California.

Mr. Crafts's question and the San Francisco pastor's answer to it are found on page 95 of his book before referred to. On the preceding page occur these words:—

> Both laymen and ministers say that even in California the Sabbath is, on the whole, better observed and Christian services better attended than five years ago.

"Five years ago," from the standpoint of 1885, was three years before the repeal of the California Sunday law. Therefore, taking into consideration all that Mr. Crafts said upon this subject, we concluded that according to testimony published in his own book, California had in 1885, when the State had been without a Sunday law for two years, better and more general Sunday observance than it had under a Sunday law.

But in a recent article in the *Christian Statesman,* Mr. Crafts complains that we have been unfair in this matter. He says:—

> A single Christian minister of that State wrote me that he had seen no better Sabbath observance than *in some Christian families* in California. This remark, quoted by me, among two hundred answers to the question, "Where have you seen the best Sabbath observance?" is used with characteristic dishonesty ... as my own verdict that California itself—not some of its Christian homes—has the best of Sabbath observance. If Christians were as scarce and morals as bad in the rest of the land [339] as in that State, our country would be a Continental Sodom, without righteous men enough to save it.

It will be observed that with characteristic recklessness Mr. Crafts misquotes his own book. The San Francisco pastor did not say, "In some Christian families," but he did say, "Among the Christian people of California." Mr. Crafts should practice what he preaches. He should be fair himself before he demands that others treat him fairly. But we fail to see wherein our use of the quotation from Mr. Crafts's book was unfair. Both laymen and ministers in California testified three years after the repeal of the Sunday law that on the whole the Sabbath was better observed and Christian services better attended in California than five years before. This we still understand to apply not to "some Christian families," but to the whole community. And it is evident that Mr. Crafts himself so understood it, for the facts which we have quoted from his book are prefaced with the following, set in italics:—

> Another element of hope in the United States is that the West has improved in Sabbath observance (except in the largest cities), as the communities have changed from frontier Territories into settled States.

Then, after only four and one-half lines relative to Dakota and Wyoming, follows the statement quoted, that "both laymen and ministers say that even in California the Sabbath is, on the whole, better observed, and Christian services better attended than five years ago." This Mr. Crafts gives in his book as an encouraging fact. He made it his own then; now he seeks to repudiate it, and likens California to Sodom. But we feel sure that in this he does that State injustice. Personal knowledge of the State, and of the people of that State, justify us in expressing this opinion; but we prefer to let the fact rest upon the testimony of another. In a letter to the New York *Observer* of October 2, "Holloway," a correspondent of that paper, writes as follows of Sunday observance in San Francisco:—

> True, there are some drawbacks here as there are in all the cities of our land. Attractive as the city is, and in its main features very desirable as a place of residence, yet the good people who have come from the East regret the absence of some things with which they have always been familiar. There are no Sabbath laws in California and no recognition of it on the statute books of the State. Labor of all kinds can be carried on without hindrance, stores may remain open for the transaction of business as on any other day of the week, places of amusement may be open without interference from the authorities, while noisy demonstrations can go on as usual. But while there is the absence of all Sunday laws we must not draw the conclusion that there is no respect paid to the Lord's day. Truth compels us to state the fact that San Francisco is a Sabbath keeping city. The drift is plainly in that direction. The moral sentiment of the people is largely in its favor, and with very rare exceptions you will find as much order and quiet in the streets as in some of our most favored Eastern cities. Those who knew California twenty years ago, now witness a far different order of things. The mass of the people respect and keep the Lord's day. No merchant of any respectability keeps his store open on the Sabbath. The wharves are deserted. The Italian fruit dealers in many localities close up their places of business, and even in the Chinese quarter of the city there is some recognition of the fact that this one day calls for a regard to decency and order, if not for religious reverence.

"Holloway" has stated the facts just as we know them to exist in California. Truth, he says, compels him to say that "San Francisco is a Sabbath-keeping city." "Truth is mighty," but it seems to be powerless to compel Mr. Crafts to do California justice. Sunday work and Sunday business instead of being on the increase in that State are on the decrease even in the cities. The drift is in the direction of more general rest upon that day. We do not say that this is due to a growing regard for the day; indeed we incline to the opinion that it is right in line with the general tendency of the times, which is toward shorter hours and more holidays; but that does not alter the case. Mr. Crafts insists that civil law is essential to the preservation of the working man's rest day. The growth of Sunday rest in California in the absence of a Sunday law is a complete refutation of Mr. Crafts's arguments in favor of "a civil Sabbath;" hence the anxiety of himself and his friends to secure as soon as possible the passage of a Sunday law in that State. The drift is now toward more general rest on Sunday. Now if they can only secure a Sunday law they can in a year or two claim that the improvement is due to the law.

According to Mr. Crafts's theory California ought to be just what he represents it to be, a veritable Sodom; but according to the facts it is as the *Observer's* correspondent represents it. The trouble with Mr. Crafts is that he cannot at the same time be loyal to the facts and to his theory; therefore he remains true to the theory, regardless of the facts. He cannot conceive of the possibility that *he* is mistaken, as he must be if the facts are as we know them to be, and as "Holloway" states them; therefore he closes his eyes to the facts, and accuses those who decline to do the same thing, of dishonesty.
