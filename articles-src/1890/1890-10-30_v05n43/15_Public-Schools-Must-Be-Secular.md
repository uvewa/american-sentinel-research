THE *Central Christian Advocate* says:—

> It is not to the public school that we must look for the religious education of our children. The most we can do in this respect, so far as the public school is concerned, is to see that all the teachers are religious men aud women. The public school cannot be maintained except as a secular school.

The *Observer* quotes this, and comments as follows:—

> The one proper place for the Christian training of children is the home. Neither the day school nor the Sunday school can fully take the place of a Christian home. Where the home is not a Christian one children are reared at a terrible disadvantage. But the same considerations which would make our schools secular, and solely secular, would certainly prevent our being able to ensure that only religious teachers should teach in them.

The first part of this paragraph is sound. "The one proper place for the Christian training of children is the home." And it is because Christian training is so much neglected in the home that professedly Christian parents imagine that it is necessary to give, or rather to attempt, such training in the public schools. Our schools should not be irreligious, but they should be kept strictly secular, and no such qualifications as that suggested by the *Advocate* should ever be permitted to be required of our public school teachers. The State has no way of determining that one teacher is religious, and that another teacher is not, except by the profession which they make, and such professions are too cheap in these days to be of any value in such a case. Besides, such a requirement would be utterly opposed to the spirit of our institutions, and to sound public policy.
