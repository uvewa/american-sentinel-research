THE following from the Rome *Sentinel *of October 11, relative to the proceedings of the Central New York Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, is significant:—

> The Rev. Dr. Torry of Utica, a fine-looking old gentleman with snow white hair, was introduced and gave an address of some length on the subject of religious education.

> The Rev. Cortland Myers, of Syracuse, also spoke in regard to the religious education in our common schools. He talked very earnestly on the subject, stating that the Methodists, Presbyterians, and Baptists, should not have their children attend schools at which religion was not taught. He also read some testimonials from different clergymen relating to this subject. Chancellor Simms immediately offered a resolution that the Bishop appoint a committee of three to consider a project for securing the introduction of a course of religious study in the common schools. The resolution was adopted. The Bishop appointed Brethern Simms, Vernon, and Oran as the committee.

We shall watch this matter with interest. With the Catholics on the one hand demanding a division of the school funds, and on the other hand the most influential Protestants demanding that the public schools give religious instruction, it is not too much to say that the future of our schools is not bright. Roman Catholics, and such mistaken Protestants are alike the enemies of the public schools.
