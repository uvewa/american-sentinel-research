SOME weeks ago, we printed the following item from one of our Western exchanges, together with the subjoined comment:—

> "The voice of the people is the voice of God," is as true to day, as when spoken in a city of Greece two thousand years ago.

"Just about as true! For instance, when, a century later, the people crowded around the Son of God, shouting, 'Crucify him! Crucify him! '"

The item has come back to us with this question from the *Orleans Herald:—*

> Then will you please tell us what is the voice of God? Was not the crucifixion a fulfillment of the prophecies?

The word of God as contained in the Scriptures is, properly speaking, the voice of God, because it expresses the will of God; but can we believe that the unchangeable One who said, "This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased," could also have said, "Crucify him, crucify him"? True, the crucifixion was in fulfillment of prophecy, but prophecy is simply an announcement of future events, which may or may not be according to the will of God. It is the *will* of God that "all men should come to repentance," (2 Peter, 3:9); but prophecy tells us that all will not repent, that on the contrary, "evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived." 2 Tim. 3:13.
