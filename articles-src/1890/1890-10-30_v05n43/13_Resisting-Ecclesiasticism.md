IN an editorial on Sunday laws, the *Colorado Graphic* says: "The people will resist these invasions of their personal rights, and with the example of other countries before them will bitterly resist ecclesiasticism. They fear the result of the union of Church and State, which means the oppression of personal liberty. As Dean Milman said, 'In proportion as the ecclesiastics became co-legislators, heresies became civil crimes and liable to civil punishments.' Such a result would be disastrous to the corner-stone of American independence. Our 4 great ' dailies are cowards who fear to defend a principle in deference to an uneducated sentimentalism."
