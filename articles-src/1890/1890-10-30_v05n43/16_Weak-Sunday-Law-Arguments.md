THAT "drowning men catch at straws," is exemplified in the case of the Sundaylaw advocates. In the hearing before the Senate Committee on the Sunday Rest bill, Rev. T. P. Stevenson, D.D., said:—

> The law of the Sabbath is binding on nations and governments as well as on individual men. This obligation is recognized through our whole history by the general cessation of business in our courts and legislatures, and in all other parts of the Government on the first day of the week.

The argument which this is supposed to contain is about as weak as distilled water. Public business is properly suspended on Sunday because the State has no right to drag before courts of justice, on that day, people who regard it as sacred. The law of the State of New York likewise exempts observers of the seventh day from attendance at court upon that day; the Legislature did not, however, in enacting that law say that the State is bound to keep the seventh day; no more should it say that the State shall keep Sunday.
