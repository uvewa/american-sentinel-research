# Sunday-Law Contest in Washington.

THE emissaries of the American Sabbath Union having been thwarted in their efforts to have enacted in Seattle a municipal ordinance closing barber shops on Sundays, have fallen back upon the State Sunday law to gain their end. That statute is as follows:—

> SECTION 2,067. It shall be unlawful for any person or persons of this Territory, to open on Sunday for the purposes of trade, or sale of goods, wares or merchandise, any shop, store, or building, or place of business whatever: Provided, That this chapter shall apply to hotels only in so far as the sales of intoxicating liquors are concerned, and shall not apply to drug stores, livery stables, and undertakers.

> SEC. 2,068. Any person or persons violating the foregoing section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof be fined in any sum not less than twenty-five dollars nor more than one hundred dollars.
The history of the movement is told substantially as follows, by a contemporary in this city:—

They propose however to make some exceptions in enforcing the law upon barbers. At one of the meetings, after considerable discussion, it was decided not to interfere with the proprietors of barber shops who should keep their bath open on Sunday. That is to say, they propose to dictate to business men as to who shall and who shall not violate the Sunday laws. The possibilities of blackmail in such a scheme are large, and if they are allowed to carry out their programme, their organization, or at least the executive officers, will probably wax rich. The absurdity of the distinction is well depicted by the Seattle *Morning Journal. *“It seems,” it says, “that the carefully balanced moralists who want to reform things in this neighborhood have made a review of the barbor-shop controversy, and they decree that it will not be wise to make war on such shops as have a bathroom annex. These can open on Sunday with perfect propriety, because cleanliness is next to godliness, and it will never do to crush any agency that will put a man in a more moral frame of mind. To a personage up a tree, however, it looks as if this thing has reduced itself to a question of anatomy. If a man’s piety is to be encouraged on Sunday by a bath—if he can take a dip without offending the religious sense of the community, he certainly should have the right to clean his nails, cut his hair, and keep his chin in repair, for all these things contribute to good citizenship and prepare him for communion with his Christian brethren. The right to have the stomach keyed up to concert pitch on Sunday keeps the restaurants sacred from the pious crusade of reformers, but this delicate distinction between the sinful qualities of a bath-tub and a razor is rather too rich for our Liberal blood.” The *Journal* adds: “If this sort of cross-eyed reform is to be the watchword of the hour, the *Journal* desires to say that it would like to see the authority by which these hair-splitting distinctions are drawn. Who gave it? Where did it come from? Does the Constitution of the State of Washington vest the power in any clique or faction to declare that a Sunday bath in a public house is a moral institution, while a Sunday shave in the same shop is an agency of the devil? Such ridiculous and arbitrary and fanatical decrees are as much out of place in Seattle to-day as a polar bear in the orange groves of Florida. We believe in law and order, and a decent respect to the honest convictions of every class, but the disposition of some folks to recognize no class as honest and conscientious but themselves is a species of slavery which no liberal citizen can indorse.”

The Washington Secular Union announces its determination to have something to say about this style of enforcing laws. Two sections of the Sunday law read as follows:—

> SEC. 2,069. And it shall be the duty of any and all public officers in this Territory, knowing of any violation of this chapter, to make complaint under oath, to the nearest justice of peace from where the offense was committed.

> SEC. 2,070. Any public officer who shall refuse or willfully neglect to inform against and prosecute offenders against this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction shall be punished by a fine of not less than twenty- five dollars nor more than one hundred dollars, and the court before which such officer shall be tried shall declare the office or appointment held by such officer vacant for thé balance of his term.
After a test in the courts as to the constitutionality of the Sunday law, if the decision shall be adverse to the Secular Union’s claim, the Union will see that the law is impartially enforced, with a view to its repeal. Mr. Reynolds, the Secretary, declares: “Since the best way to insure the repeal of a bad law is to rigidly enforce it—let it be known there can be no more open stores, no more sales by the publishers of newspapers on Sunday, nor can the necessary work be done on Sunday to get out the Monday morning edition—no more business of any kind that comes within the scope of this law.”

The statute (§2,070) provides a means of doing this, for any officer refusing to inform [357] and prosecute is liable to fine and deposition from office, and the Washington Secular Union can put the machinery of law into motion. The statute was made for the use of the “Sabbath” fanatics, but it cuts both ways. Let everybody observe the law or none.

The first man singled out by the Sunday people for prosecution is a member of the Secular Union, which promptly retained counsel to defend him.
