# The School Question.

“WHY, my friends, the free schoolhouse was established and in full operation long before the Republican party was born. Schools will be in successful operation all over this country long after it is dead. It was utterly impossible to maintain a republican government without education, as it would be impossible for a bird to hang in the air with all the feathers plucked from its wings. It is a part, and an essential part, of the existence of any republican government. It has got to stand in the intelligence and virtue of the people. It cannot stand any other way. The power comes from them; they must know how to exercise it wisely and well. They must have the virtue to do what they know is right, and have the virtue to shun what they know to be wrong. The school-house is the place, and provisions were made for it at the very foundation of the Government, and made by the men that ordained and established the Government. What we oppose is the prostitution of the school-house, just as Christ opposed the prostitution of the temple. The temple at Jerusalem had been a house of prayer, dedicated to the pure worship of God, but had been defiled by the money-changers and thieves, and when he entered it with a scourge of plaited cords, he whipped away the thieves and said it should not be a den of thieves but a house of prayer. We stand by the school-house, and in it and around it, and we are going to stand under it and support it, but we don’t intend, if there is intelligence and virtue enough left in the hearts of the people, that the school-house shall be made an instrumentality for proscribing any class of our people. We don’t intend that the school-house shall be an instrumentality for invading the sanctuary of the homes of the people and compelling one class of people to send to one school in preference to another, if they prefer that other. ..... And if the Church and State were united, it would be impossible to preserve liberty to the people. Hence we believe in liberty; we believe in a man sending his children to whatever school he pleases. He is the guardian of that child during non-age. God has appointed him, and the mother, and we will stand guard over that right. We don’t propose that a Methodist, if he wants to send his child to a Methodist school, shall be compelled to send it to a Catholic school. He has a right to have it educated in that faith if he wants to do it. We are all governed by our faith. Why should the Government be substituted for the father and mother, and compel the Methodist family to send their child [356] to the Catholic school or who take the Catholic child and send it to the Methodist school; or why take anybody’s child and send it to the infidel school? We stand on the right of family government. We stand believing that the father and mother have the right to superintend and supervise the education of their children; to select the teacher and select the school; and it is the right of the State, and the duty of the State, to provide the means of educating all the children in the State, but the parents have the right to select the school; and if they don’t want to avail themselves of the opportunities that have been afforded by the State, and they want to incur the additional expense, and thousands and hundreds of thousands of good people do it every day, and have the right to do it—let them send their children to their church schools.”—*From Speech of Hon. Roger Q. Mills.*
