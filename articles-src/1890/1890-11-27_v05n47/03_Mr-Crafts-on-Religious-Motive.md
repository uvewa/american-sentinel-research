MR. CRAFTS says:—

> When it is asserted that the movement to secure a law of Congress against Sunday work in Government service is really an effort of ecclesiastics to unite Church and State, I am accustomed to hold up some of the petitions that have been smutted by the hands of the toilers as they have signed them while at their work.

Well, when Mr. Crafts denies that the movement which he represents is primarily, and indeed almost wholly, a religious one, we are accustomed to quote his own words: when asked if the needed physical rest could not be secured without any reference to religion, his answer was, "Take the religion out and you take the rest out." And so we say, Take the religious motive out of Mr. Crafts's work and there would not be energy enough left to move a thistle-down.
