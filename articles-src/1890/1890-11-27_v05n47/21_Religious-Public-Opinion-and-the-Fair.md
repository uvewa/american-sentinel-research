"THE Evangelical Alliance at Boston," says the *Mail and Express, *"demands the closing of the Chicago Fair on Sunday. Religious public opinion all over the country is a unit on the question. The managers of the Fair cannot afford to disregard this potent fact." Certainly that is the verdict of "religious public opinion," but how about the "civil Sabbath" of which we hear so much? What is the matter with the American Sabbath Union's adjustable religio-civil rest day for the poor workingman who doesn't want to rest?
