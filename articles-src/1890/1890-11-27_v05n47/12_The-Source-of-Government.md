PUBLIC sentiment is a greater force, sometimes, than law; it compels more perfect obedience. In actual fact, there are people who would and do break laws to which the public are indifferent, who are most careful to respect public sentiment. The question may be asked, What is public sentiment? It is public intelligence. As the honest old Greek declared centuries ago, the character of a city is shown by the men elected to control its affairs; or, as a recent political economist puts it, "You complain of the character of the men in your State Legislature; they represent the average character of the people who placed them in power." So it is true that the standards of any community express the average character of that community. There may be a few whose standards are higher than the public standard represents, as there are sure to be some below the standards expressed; but the social, educational, sanitary conditions of every community are up to the standard that the greatest number in that community desire—no better, no worse.—*Christian Union.*
