# Religion in the Public Schools.

“SHALL religion be taught in the public schools?” is a question that is receiving more attention, and being more generally discussed in this country than is almost any other subject. The press, the pulpit, and the people generally are more or less occupied with this important query; and while the general sentiment is clearly against what is known as “sectarianism,” it is urged by many that the State ought to give “unsectarian instruction in the fundamental truths of Christianity.” But even if this proposition were granted the problem would be very far from a satisfactory solution; these questions would still remain as troublers. What is unsectarian instruction? and what are the fundamental principles of Christianity?

It has been urged by some, and the idea has been accepted by many with little or no thought, that the moral law as contained in the ten commandments, and the principles of morality as laid down in the Sermon on the Mount, embody all that is really essential, and should be taught in the public schools. This, we are assured by those who advocate it, would be strictly unsectarian. But let us see if indeed the ten commandments and the Sermon on the Mount could be taught without giving sectarian instruction.

To be unsectarian, even in the restricted sense of being common to all Christians, any portion of the Scriptures would have to convey to all claiming to be Christians the same meaning, that is, all Christians must understand such portions of Scripture alike. The question naturally arises, Is this true of the ten commandments and the Sermon on the Mount? Take for example the fourth commandment: “Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.” As between Protestants and Catholics even this rendering of this commandment is sectarian, and the numbering of it is sectarian. In the Douay Bible it reads, “Remember thou keep holy the Sabbath day;” and in Catholic catechisms it is not the fourth commandment but the third.

But that is not the only, nor indeed the most serious difficulty. All do not understand the fourth commandment alike. Some take it just as it reads: “The seventh day is the Sabbath;” others that it now enjoins the keeping of the first day of the week, while others think that it is now of no binding force whatever. Now suppose that it is read in a school in which “non-sectarian religious instruction” is to be given. A pupil reads: “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.” Ex. 20:8-11. He then asks: What is the Sabbath day? or, What is really required by this commandment? or, Is this commandment now binding upon us just as it was upon those to whom it was given at Sinai? Must the teacher answer, “I am not permitted to tell you?” Well has another remarked, “If anything in the world is calculated to bring both the teacher and the Bible into ridicule, we think that such teaching as this would surely accomplish that result.”

Turning to the Sermon on the Mount, we are confronted by difficulties no less serious. Even professed Christians differ widely as to whether this sermon is a divine or only a human utterance. The difficulty is thus stated by a Roman Catholic writer of some prominence:—

> The Unitarians, not believing in the divinity of [354] Christ, only look upon that sermon as a human production, while other Christian denominations accept its every word as the infallible teaching of infinite wisdom; so that the teacher cannot undertake to tell his pupil in the public school, after reading to him that sermon, whether he is to accept it as the word of God or only as the word of a man, without invading the realms of denominational teaching. And all will admit that there is an infinite difference between the weight to be attached to the language of an all-wise God and even the wisest utterances of a mere man when giving expression to the deductions of his own finite and feeble reason. There are many passages in that sermon which are very differently construed by people of different religious denominations. For example, it is there said, “Ye have heard that it was said to them of old, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shall perform unto the Lord thine oaths; but I say unto you, swear not at all.” This passage is by many very conscientious people interpreted as prohibiting the taking of an oath as a witness or otherwise, and hence they never swear, even in our courts of justice, but affirm.

“Again,” says the same writer, “Christians of some denominations interpret the Sermon on the Mount as authorizing the absolute dissolution, by divorce, of the valid bonds of matrimony for certain causes, so as to allow one of the divorced parties to marry again during the life of the other, while other Christians maintain that all such second marriages during the lives of both the divorced parties are, morally speaking, invalid and wrong.”

These examples might be multiplied almost indefinitely, but it is quite unnecessary; the fact is that there is no such thing as “unsectarian teaching of religion” possible. Even the most elementary truths of the Christian religion cannot be taught without teaching things which are sectarian as between different bodies of professed Christians to say nothing of the beliefs of those who are not Christians, but whose rights are just as sacred, and to be just as jealously guarded by the State, as are the rights of Christians.

The State is composed of people of all religions and of no religion. The public schools, are supported by a tax levied upon all property alike, and it is but just that it should be expended in a manner approved by all, or that, at least, men should not be compelled to indirectly contribute to the support and propagation of religious tenets which they do not believe, by being taxed for the support of schools in which religion is taught.C. P. B.

THE *Christian Union, *an influential journal, would like to see the Bible used in the public schools simply as a text book of literature and history, but adds that “if our Catholic, Jewish or Agnostic brethren object to opening schools with acts of worship, such worship should in our judgment be discontinued.” We can speak in behalf of Jewish-American citizens who, without exception, are unalterably opposed to teaching sectarian doctrines of any kind in our public schools. We are for an absolute divorce of Church and State in every sense of the term.—*Jewish Times and Observer.*
