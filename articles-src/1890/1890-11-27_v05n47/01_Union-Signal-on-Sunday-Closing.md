THE *Union Signal* notes the fact that "the closing work of the Woman's Temperance Alliance (non-partisan) was to vote down, after thorough discussion, a resolution in favor of Sunday closing of the Columbian Exposition, upon the ground that it had nothing to do with temperance." And the Woman's Temperance Alliance did just right.
