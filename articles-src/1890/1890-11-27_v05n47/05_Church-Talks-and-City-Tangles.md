# Church Talks and City Tangles.

JUST now a very singular phase of public sentiment is to be observed in this metropolitan community [New York City]. Several of the more prominent clergymen are openly engaged in a political movement, the object of which is to overturn one of the two great parties bodily and cast it out of power. One makes a speech in a public convention on a prayer-meeting night, which is openly ridiculed by an editor who did not hear it. Another is [was] mentioned as a prominent candidate for the office of mayor and has his “interviews” like a boss. A third writes a letter in which he represents Divine Providence as throwing its (no “her”) watery arms around this island—which is really quite good for a Baptist—and the political newspapers are gibing to their hearts’ content.

On the other hand the great secular journals are engaged in a determinate onslaught upon the Rev. Dr. C. A. Briggs, as a professor in the Union Theological Seminary, for laxness in doctrine, injury to the interests of the institution on one of the foundations of which he stands, departing from the teaching he promised when he was elected, and without moral or legal right to his chair. One of them, in two very plain editorials, calls upon him peremptorily to “abdicate” his position, to resign his charge, and cease his “underhanded course of polishing up his crude unscriptural theories to classes of unsuspecting young men, locked in his class-rooms.” Another continues in the same strain, and reaches the cheerful conclusion that, as the great majority of Presbyterians have declared themselves in favor of revising their old creed, and some of the most noted and most popular of the Presbyterian pastors in New York and other great towns have thoroughly indorsed the movement, the ministers of the denomination “do not know themselves what they believe,” and are in the frame of mind of “the agnostic who has no faith to propagate;” and a third gives as the reason for the reluctance of the clergy to “move against” Professor Briggs, “the dissension that would follow such a step;” and it adds also that, if a charge of heresy were brought against him, “the presbytery would be the scene of a fierce battle.”

It becomes a question of interesting consideration whether matters would be bettered in such a state of things if the ministers would just take on themselves the management of politics, and the editors of the secular journals would assume the care of the orthodoxy represented in the Seminary and the pulpits.—*Every Thursday.*
