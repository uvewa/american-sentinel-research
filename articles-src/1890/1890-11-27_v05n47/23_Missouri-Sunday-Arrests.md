A LETTER from Fayette, Missouri, dated November 16, contains the information that "William Fritz and Robert Gibb, members of a Seventh-day Adventist Church in Howard County, near Armstrong, Missouri, have been indicted and arrested for performing common labor, on their farms, on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday. The cases are docketed for trial in the Circuit Court at Fayette, Missouri, on Tuesday, December 2, 1890." By this it would seem that Missouri is anxious to put herself on record by the side of Tennessee, Georgia, and Arkansas as among the first to inaugurate a persecuting enforcement of religious laws.
