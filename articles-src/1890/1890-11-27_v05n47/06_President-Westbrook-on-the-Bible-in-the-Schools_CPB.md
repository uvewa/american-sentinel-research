"SHALL the Bible be read in the public schools?" was the subject of a speech by President Westbrook, at the Portsmouth Secular Congress. He, of course, gave a negative answer to the question, and supported it by the following reasons (actual and so-called), which he dwelt upon at considerable length:—

> 1. Because there is no common agreement as to what constitutes the Bible.

> 2. Because there is no common agreement as to what parts are historical and what parts are allegorical.
> 3. Because there is no common agreement as to what doctrines are taught in the Bible.
> 4. Because it contains so much that is cruel and obscene.
> 5. Because the moral is so mixed up with the immoral that there is great danger of contamination by contact.
> 6. We might just as well go one step further and say that we object to the reading of the Bible in our State schools because of its defective morality.
> 7. Because the teachers can so manipulate it in reading as to favor their own particular views.
> 8. Because it would not secure the object contemplated.
> 9. Because it is a violation of the secular principle of the Constitution of the United States, and of the Constitutions of the several States, which forbids the teaching of sectarianism at the public expense.
We quite agree with Doctor Westbrook in his conclusion, namely, that the Bible has no proper place in the public school; but must dissent from several of his "reasons." Indeed, the last three are about the only real reasons given, and one of them will hardly bear investigation. We will examine the several reasons by number.

1. It is true that there is no common agreement as to what constitutes the Bible, but that fact is not a *reason* why it should not be read in the schools. There is universal agreement as to what constitutes the Book of Mormon and the Westminster Confession of Faith; yet it would not be proper to read them in the public schools. The reason that the Bible is rightfully excluded is because it is a religious book, and the State cannot properly teach religion.

2. The Doctor's second reason is of no more force than the first. It is true that the difference of opinion to which he alludes does exist, but even if there were perfect agreement on this point the reading of the Bible in schools supported in whole or in part by the State, would be no less objectionable than it is now. Were this not the case a book of selections might be compiled embracing only such passages as are universally admitted to be either historical or ethical. But the fact is that the entire value of the Bible is due to the fact that it is religious; it belongs therefore to a realm beyond the jurisdiction of the State, and therefore the State should let it alone.

3. A common agreement as to the doctrines of the Bible would not alter the case one particle. It is not the business of the State to teach religion, and no agreement, however perfect, could possibly give to civil government a jurisdiction that does not naturally belong to it.

Reasons 4, 5, and 6, are substantially the same, and are utterly false and misleading. The Bible is so far from being an immoral book that it contains the purest morality. But it is not our purpose to dwell on that phase of the question. The Bible is not a football to be kicked about between contending parties and to be judged by school-boards. The State has no right to sit in judgment upon it and to decide that it is too immoral to be read in the public schools. Even President Westbrook must admit this, for if one State or one school board could properly exclude the Bible because in its opinion the book is immoral, another State or another school board might properly admit it because in its opinion it is moral. The very nature of the book places it above the jurisdiction of States and of school-boards. It comes to us as a supernatural thing, a revelation from God, and thus appeals to the consciences of men, and binds them under penalties entirely beyond the power of human governments either to enforce or to remit. This it is that places it beyond the domain of civil government and removes it far beyond the jurisdiction of school-boards and town meetings.

Each man must accept or reject the Bible for himself, and the consequences of his decision he must abide. It is a matter [371] between his own soul and his God, and the State has no right to exert its influence to turn him either this way or that.

To put it in the most concise form, President Westbrook and those who hold with him, object to the Bible in the school *because they do not believe it;* this being the case did they believe the Bible they would stand shoulder to shoulder with those who demand that it shall be read in our public schools. But by assuming this position they virtually demand that the State shall decide that the Bible is not the word of God; but the State has no more right to make such a decision than it has to decide the contrary. To say that the State shall decide that the Bible is not the word of God, that it is, on the contrary, an immoral book unfit to be read in public, is to assent that it might properly decide that it is a moral book and decree that it shall be read in the schools. The only tenable and consistent position is to demand that the State shall let the question severely alone. C. P. B.
