AN earnest effort will unquestionably be made this winter to secure a re-enactment of the Sunday law by our Legislature.

Rev. N. R. Johnston of this city is one of those most actively engaged in this project of reviving the old penal Sunday legislation, which some years ago was abolished. Mr. Johnson sends to an evening paper a summary of recent legislation in some European countries on this subject, and seems to think that we in California should follow suit. From this summary it appears that in Austria, in order that the printers may have a rest day, it has been decreed that no newspapers shall publish a Monday morning issue, and in Germany the Socialists have introduced a bill before the Reichstag "forbidding all industrial occupations on Sundays and holidays."

Despotic governments, in which there is an established religion, may with some consistency enact such arbitrary laws, but in this free country, where the Constitution provides against the establishment of any religion, they are absolutely out of place. Does Mr. Johnston imagine that our people would enact a law like that in Austria forbidding the issue of a Monday morning paper because work on it has been done on Sunday? Or does he suppose it would be possible here to secure and enforce a law like that which the German Socialists ask for, forbidding all industrial occupations on Sundays and holidays? Mr. Johnston is an intelligent man and he is well aware that our Constitution, as it stands, does not favor but opposes such legislation as this which, though nominally in the interests of the laboring man, is really in the interests of a religious creed; and it is for that reason, undoubtedly, that he has joined the "National Reform Society," as it is called.

The avowed object of this Society is so to amend the United States Constitution as substantially to make what is called "Evangelical Christianity" the established religion. Mr. Johnson is doubtless honest and sincere in his opinions favorable to such changes, but he will find that the people do not want and will not have them.—*Morning Times, Oakland, Cal.*
