AT a Sunday-law Convention recently held in Burlington, Iowa, President Blanchard, of Wheaton College, said:—

> I would like to see the Christian people of this land stand aloof from political men and measures, until office-seekers agree to represent Christian principles in Christian government. If the churches would do this, political aspirants, to a man, would soon send up the cry, "What shall I do to be saved?"

No doubt of it; and the question would have no reference whatever to eternal salvation, but to salvation from political death.
