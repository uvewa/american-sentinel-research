# Stirring the Whole Country.

THE American Sabbath Union, with the National Reform Association, and all their numerous allied organizations, are stirring the whole country to bring to bear such an influence upon the managers of the World’s Fair that they will give religious recognition to Sunday, not by permitting the closing of such exhibits as it pleases the exhibitors to close, but to compel the exclusion of the public and the entire cessation of all the business of the Exposition on that day, whether such an arrangement shall coincide with the wishes of the exhibitors and the public, or not.

The effect of the agitation for the Sunday closing of the World’s Fair, is evidently to cement the forces of religious nationalism in a more compact body, acquaint them more fully with their own power and numbers, and give them assurance to drop the specious plea for a “civil Sunday” entirely, and concentrate their entire effort openly, and without reserve, upon the securing of the enforcement of a religious observance of Sunday.

The following, from the “Pearl of Days,” will show how, as that publication says, “there has never before been such an awakening” of a desire to secure the enforcement of a religious form:—

> “The mails are bringing us daily a great number and variety of petitions to be forwarded to the Columbian Commission against opening the World’s Fair on Sundays. Some are very short and general, others are longer and more in detail, and others are carefully elaborate in argument but all manifest one and the same earnest, decided and urgent spirit of patriotic, and Christian opposition to the opening of the Exposition on the Lord’s day. Many of them are from the Young People’s Societies of Christian Endeavor, and from Sunday-school officers, teachers, and scholars, and from county and State Sunday- school conventions. Others come from pastors, officials, members, and adherents of congregations of nearly all denomi nations—and often these have been authorized by a rising vote.

“Then follow numerous resolutions, appeals, protests, and petitions, by the unanimous action of ecclesiastical assemblies of all grades, and which represent hundreds of thousands of the best people of the whole country. Temperance organizations, patriotic orders, labor unions, and similar societies also wheel into line. Young Men’s Christian Associations are working faithfully for the cause. Outside of all these, we are constantly receiving petitions from citizens of important places without distinction of sect, sex, or race, and covered with hundreds of signatures of reputable persons. The reasons assigned are legal, historical, patriotic, humane, benevolent, moral, and religious. They insist upon the divine institution, the permanent obligation, the blessings and privileges of the Sabbath of God and man. They deprecate the desecration of the Christian Sabbath at the Exposition as an affront to its Lord, as a wrong to the Nation, as a disgrace to the fair name of our country, as a transgression of the laws of Illinois, and of every State that has any Sabbath laws. . . . And finally and supremely, in all these documents, the warm Christian feeling of the country is expressed in ardent love for the hallowed day, in loyal obedience to the fourth commandment, and in deprecation of God’s judgments upon this generation for the violation of his law of the rest day.”

All this is significant, not indeed of a revival of fervent piety, but of a religious feeling which manifests itself in formal observances while neglecting the weightier matters, judgment, mercy, and faith. Sunday is fast becoming recognized as “the badge of all religion,” that is of all form religion, and those who so regard it will never rest till they secure for it formal recognition from the national Government.W. H. M.

BY its persistent appeals for sumptuary laws the *Rocky Mountain News* is inviting its party to defeat. It goes so far as to say that to open barber shops on Sunday is “the violation of a divine law,” and “that, if necessary, a city ordinance should be adopted to keep the shops closed on Sunday.” Of course on the same principle the *News* would advocate a State and national Sunday law, which is at variance with one of the vital principles of our national Government. . . . If the journeymen barbers desire to rest on Sunday there is no law to prevent them from doing so, and they have a perfect right to refuse to work on that day. Sunday rest is a question which every American citizen should be allowed to determine for himself. He may desire to rest on the seventh day of the week in accordance with his religious belief or from personal choice; or on the second day of the week for like reasons.—*Colorado Graphic*. [359-360]

A GENTLEMAN at West Sunbury, Pennsylvania, sends us these encouraging words:—

“I am a Presbyterian, and worship on Sunday, and believe it to be the right day, but would force no one to believe or practice as I do. I have been reading THE AMERICAN SENTINEL for two years. It is doing a good work; God bless it.”

“THE work of converting the heathen world goes on apace,” says *America*. “One of the latest steamers to leave London for the west coast of Africa had on board four hundred and sixty tons of gunpowder, eleven cases of gin, ten thousand casks of rum, and fourteen missionaries.” But, then, England has a National Sunday law, and acknowledges that its sovereigns reign by the grace of God, it is, therefore, according to the National Reform idea, a Christian country, and critics should keep their hands off!

IN a speech in the Senate on the 30th ult, Mr. Carlisle denounced the new tariff bill as “an entirely new departure in the application of the principle of protection in this country copied from the paternal governments of Europe.” How true this is is not for us to say; but that this country is copying from the paternal governments in many things does not admit of a doubt. The effort seems to be to make the Government everything and individuals and States nothing. And in this aping of European methods of government most of the several States are not one whit behind the general Government; paternalism is in the air.

WE are asked by a correspondent to answer the following question:—

> If the seventh-day people who now object to being compelled to keep Sunday were in the majority, would not the fourth commandment, which says, “In it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates,” require them to make laws compelling the Sunday people to keep the seventh day?

Not as we understand the commandment. “Within thy gates,” means only upon property under your immediate control; not the whole of any country. It is the duty of every man to see to it that no work is done on his own premises upon the day that he regards as the Sabbath; but the commandment gives no warrant whatever for Sabbath legislation. Were they in the majority, seventh-day people might, like others have done before them, apostatize from God and appeal to the State, but in so doing they would prove recreant to the very principles which they now maintain.

“THE National Reform Association,” says the *Union Signal*, “has started a ‘Citizens’ and Business Men’s Protest,’ and requests all citizens, especially those engaged in active business, to write to the Columbian Exposition Committee, Chicago, using preferably their own printed letter heads, and saying simply, ‘I join,’ or ‘This firm joins, in the protest against the proposed opening of the World’s Columbian Exposition on the Sabbath.’” It is suggested that there are few towns where such letters cannot be secured from a majority of the business men. This seems very likely, when we remember that the boycott is to be used, if needs be, to secure Sunday closing of the great Fair.

THE following is from the *Christian Advocate*, of this city:—

> The religious notices in our Sunday papers quite frequently afford suggestive reading. Some of them are cheap, frivolous advertisements, and better adapted to a Bowery show than a Christian church. But the desire to get a crowd is almost a disease with some men. Success to them is a matter of camp-stools and extra chairs, and a full church an evidence of genius. It is a matter of profound thankfulness that the Methodist ministers of this city are singularly free from blame in this matter. Perhaps they have the crowd already and do not require startling topics and sensational head-lines to fill their churches. But churches filled in this way are soon emptied, and even when tilled, they are empty.

We are glad that the *Advocate* can say that the ministers of the denomination which it represents are free from blame in this matter. But there is another matter in which they are not thus free, namely, in the demand for laws which they imagine would drive people to the churches, by depriving them of Sunday papers, and by closing to them the various places of secular resort. It is true that rigid Sunday laws strictly enforced might fill the churches, but it is also true that if filled in this way they would still be empty.

“INTOLERANCE,” says *Public Opinion *of San Francisco, “should not manifest itself in any quarter on the day of election. The American people should not proscribe any citizen on account of either his nationality or his creed. Particularly careful should they be not to send a candidate, who is to the manner born, out of their own party because he does not belong to their church. It was broadly hinted at San Jose that the delegates from the interior would have no candidate who does not belong to the American religion, whatever that may be.” We are afraid, however, that the drift is in the direction of a religious test for candidates. The “American religion” may not as yet be very clearly defined, but nobody knows how soon it may be, and how soon men must profess the “American creed” in order to secure votes. It is certain, however, when the time does come every man who is in politics for office will be a Christian after the straightest sect of the “American religion,” whatever it happens to be.

THE real dignity and worth of a book are not always indicated by its title; this is true of “Jack the Conqueror,” No. 2 of “The Young People’s Library.” The subtitle, “Overcoming Difficulties,” is, however, really descriptive of the book and relieves, in a measure, the somewhat unpleasant impression created by the more sensational appellation.

The book contains three stories, all well calculated to beget worthy ambitions and stimulate to praiseworthy effort. It is probable that none of the narratives are unvarnished recitals of the experiences of a single individual, yet they are exceedingly true to life, and will tend to correct rather than give those false views of life which are so common in story books, and so harmful to the young. Altogether, “Jack the Conqueror, or Overcoming Difficulties” is a very readable and worthy juvenile book which can be safely placed in the hands of the young. “The Young People’s Library” deserves, and should have, the support of all who really desire to secure unobjectionable reading for their children. The numbers are of uniform size, style, and price. Each volume contains 160 pages 5x7 inches; the cheaper binding is paper, the more expensive, cloth embossed in jet and gold. The volumes sell for 25, and 50 cents, according to binding. Pacific Press, New York, N. Y., and Oakland, California.

THE same cause which restrained the vigor, polluted the character of the Church; for, being unable immediately to repress its own spiritual weapons, the violent animosities of its ministers, and impatient of the gradual influence of time and reason, in a dark and disastrous moment it had recourse to that temporal sword which was not intended for its service, and which it has never yet employed without disgrace or without impunity.—*Waddington.* [361]
