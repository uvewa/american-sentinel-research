# Just As the Chinese.

THE following paragraph is from a recent editorial in the *Mail and Express*, of this city, whose editor and proprietor is President of the American Sabbath Union. It reflects the intolerance of the man, and, indirectly, of the organization at whose head he stands:—

> Let Mormons be prevented from entering our country, just as are the Chinese, and for the same reason, that they are heathen. The Mormons worship Adam as God, they have laid our Lord Jesus Christ on the shelf, they have lords many and gods many, they sing praises to Joseph Smith in Christian songs stolen from our hymn books, substituting Smith’s name for Christ’s; they blaspheme the true God. Thus the main reason that reconciled the Christian sentiment of this country to the exclusion of the Chinese, that they are heathen, should also operate to secure from Congress a law to prohibit the importation of Mormons. Then the miserable “elders” and “bishops” and “high priests” of Joe Smith, Bacchus, and Lewdness could not arrive here with harems of Scandinavians or other deluded foreigners. We earnestly commend this suggestion to the powerful support of Mormon-preventing Senator Edmunds, of Vermont.

In our opinion Mormonism is very far from the truth; and we have spoken in no uncertain tones on the question of the suppression of polygamy; but we dissent from the proposition to exclude any man from this country on account of his religion. The Mormon has no right to practice polygamy, and the Government has a perfect right to demand that he shall obey the marriage laws of the country; but with the “worship of Adam,” and their “praise to Joseph Smith in Christian songs stolen from our hymn books,” the Government can have nothing whatever to do, any more than it can with the Roman Catholic worship of the Virgin Mary. C. P. B.
