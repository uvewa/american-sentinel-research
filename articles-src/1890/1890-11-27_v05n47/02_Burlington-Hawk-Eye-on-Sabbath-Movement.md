THE *Burlington Hawk-Eye* was not far wrong, as to the purpose of the National Reformers, when it placed over one of the Sabbath Convention reports, in large headlines, these words: *"The Fourth Commandment!* *A Series of Conventions to Secure its Observance.* "We are convinced," says another Iowa paper, in commenting upon this, "that this 'Sabbathrest ' movement originated in a fanatical, religious zeal, and that its success will depend upon the continuous manifestation of such a spirit. Force is the method sought to be employed. The persuasive elements of the gospel have no place in such schemes." And this is the truth.
