# Baptists Oppose It.

ACCORDING to *The Christian Index and Southern Baptist,* Baptists are opposed to teaching religion in the public schools. That paper in its issue of February 27, says:—

> Baptists are uncompromisingly opposed to union of Church and State. Wherever and whenever this contest has arisen they have invariably stood on the side of liberty of conscience, and, if need be, have sealed, with their blood, their undying devotion to this principle. The State must not maintain a religious establishment. The public schools are forbidden to teach religion. In them the Bible is practically ignored. The children who attend these schools represent parents of every shade of religious belief. Some are Gentiles, others are Jews. Some are Calvinists, others are Arminians. Some are Trinitarians, others are Unitarians. Some want God, Christ, and the Bible recognized, others want neither God, Christ nor the Bible mentioned. What is to be done? Education alone, makes men neither moral nor religious. The remedy is to be found in the family, and in the denominational school. Fathers and mothers, in the early years of childhood must do the work of religious instruction and training.
