LAST fall, Rev. N. R. Johnston, of Oakland, California, was appointed a member of a committee to organize local Sunday Unions in that State. In commenting upon this fact we incidentally remarked that it was certainly fit that he should be a member of the committee, since, though socially a very worthy man, his religious views were such that he could not see why if a theocracy was good for the Jews it would not be equally good for us; nor why if it was right anciently to put men to death for Sabbath breaking, it would not be the proper thing to do now. In short, we said that he was unable to distinguish between a divinely-established theocracy and a man-made counterfeit of a divine theocracy. Mr. Johnston felt grieved at this, and complained, both privately and publicly, that we had misrepresented him. Till now we have remained silent under the charge, having in our removal to this city mislaid the evidence of the truth of that which we said. However, a recent article in the *Christian Statesman,* from Mr. Johnston's pen, has furnished abundant evidence that we stated the case none too strongly; and in this, and the preceding number of THE SENTINEL, under the heading, "How Far They Propose to Carry It," this evidence is given. Mr. Johnston may not mean all that he says; in fact, we have often thought that he was better than his theory; but he should not find fault when people take him just as he says, especially when he expresses his sentiments in carefully written articles for publication.
