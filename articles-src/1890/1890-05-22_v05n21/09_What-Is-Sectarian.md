THE proper answer to the question whether the Bible is "a sectarian book," depends wholly upon what is meant by the question, and upon the relations in which it is asked.

The common English version of the Bible, being equally accepted and used among all Protestants, is not, as between them, in any sense sectarian. This same version, however, is such as between Protestants and Catholics, since it is not accepted and used by both. So, also, the Douay version of the Bible, though not sectarian as between Catholics, is such as between Protestants and Catholics, since it is not accepted and used by both. To introduce into the public school either of these versions, and make the reading of either a part of school exercise, whether for the purpose of worship or that of religious instruction, is plainly to place in the public school a sectarian book as between Protestants and Catholics.

Protestants would not be satisfied if the Douay version were thus established in the public school under the authority and regulation of law, and would justly claim that this is using the public school as the instrument of Catholic propagandism. The objection is just as legitimate when urged by the Catholic against a like use of the common English version in the public school. The matter of fact is that the common English version and the Douay version of the Bible, are so dissimilar that, as between Catholics and Protestants, they are both sectarian books. The Catholics accept one, and the Protestants the other, and neither accept both.

The just conclusion, in view of these facts, is, that in a public-school system supported by general taxation and regulated by State authority, the introduction of the Bible in either of these versions or in any version, had better be omitted altogether, and the instruction and exercises confined exclusively to the *secular* sphere of knowledge. This which is far from being a new opinion with us, as it seems to us, is abundantly sufficient for the public school, especially in a community taxed in common for its support, with diverse religious beliefs and preferences. We see no other ground that is absolutely equitable and just toward all classes, and free from all partiality toward any class.

We dissent alike from those Protestants and those Catholics, who would use the public school for religious propagandism in any form. The simple truth is that the State as such, has properly nothing to do with such propagandism, and should omit it altogether, leaving the work to other and more fitting agencies.—*Independent.*
