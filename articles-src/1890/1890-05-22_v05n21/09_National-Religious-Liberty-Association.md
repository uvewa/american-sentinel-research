# National Religious Liberty Association.

## Declaration Of Principles.

> We believe in the religion taught by Jesus Christ.

> We believe in temperance, and regard the liquor traffic as a curse to society.
> We believe in supporting the civil government, and submitting to its authority.
> We deny the right of any civil government to legislate on religious questions.
> We believe it is the right, and should be the privilege, of every man to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience.
> We also believe it to be our duty to use every lawful and honorable means to prevent religious legislation by the civil government; that we and our fellow-citizens may enjoy the inestimable blessings of both religious and civil liberty.
C. ELDREDGE,*President.*

W. H. MCKEE,*Secretary.*

IN the Senate, April 23 and 24, petitions were presented in favor of the Sunday-rest Bill, by Senators Quay of Pennsylvania, Spooner of Wisconsin, Frye of Maine, Reagan of Texas, Ransom of North Carolina, Butler of South Carolina, Dawes of Massachusetts, Harris of Tennessee, Blair of New Hampshire, Teller of Colorado, Sherman of Ohio, Pierce of North Dakota, Dixon of Rhode Island. Cockrell of Missouri, Turpie of Indiana, Pasco of Florida, Farwell of Illinois, Evarts of New York, Wilson of Maryland, and Payne of Ohio.

In the *Record,* these petitions are variously characterized, as follows: “A petition of citizens of Pennsylvania;” “A petition of 287 citizens of Wisconsin;” A petition containing the signatures of 40 citizens of New Mexico;” “What purports to be a petition praying for the passage of a Sunday-rest Bill. It is stated that it was indorsed by 184 people in a mass-meeting of citizens of Dallas, Texas, and indorsed by 190 people in a massmeeting of citizens of Gainesville, Texas. Somebody signs it, saying that it was indorsed, but it is without the names of the petitioners;” “A petition of 33 citizens of South Carolina;” “A petition of 99 citizens of Massachusetts;” “The petition of the Superintendent of the Cumberland Presbyterian Sunday schools at Lebanon, Tennessee, *representing* 75 citizens;” “Petition of Lambert S. Wood, of Missoula, Montana, representing labor organizations in that State;” “Petition of 75 members of the Second Congregational Church of Denver, Colorado;” “A petition with 1157 *representative* indorsements of the citizens of Ohio;” “A petition of 60 members of the Methodist Episcopal church of Rhode Island:” “Petitions collected by the National Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, . . . containing 96 signatures from Missouri;” “A petition of 202 citizens of Indiana, collected by the National Woman’s Christian Temperance Union;” “A petition of 234 citizens of Kansas;” “A petition of “members of the First Baptist church of Pensacola, Florida;” “A petition of 376 citizens of Indiana;” “A petition of over 400 citizens of New York;” “A petition of 135 members of the Hampden Presbyterian Church of Baltimore, Maryland; “A petition of citizens of North Dakota;” and “A petition of 550 citizens of Ohio.”

The above testimony of the *Congressional Record* for only two days, bears witness to the persistency of those who favor the passage of the religious bills now before Congress, in urging these measures upon the attention of Congressmen.

HON. WILLIAM C. OATES, of Alabama, said, in the House of Representatives, on April 16, while speaking upon the bill “to define and regulate the jurisdiction of the Courts of the United States: ”—

> There is one alarming feature in the tendency of the times, in the tendency of Congress, and in the tendency of our Federal judiciary, and that is, towards the centralization of Federal power.

> Why, Mr. Speaker, let any man look at the number of bills that are brought before Congress at every session, that are properly within the jurisdiction which Congress has assumed, and see how utterly impossible it is for Congress, even if it sat from year’s end to year’s end, to give consideration to even one third of them, and let him in all candor say whither we are tending. How are you going to administer the affairs of your Government in its present form, if this tendency to the enlargement of its jurisdiction is to go on? It behooves every lover of this country to cut down Federal jurisdiction instead of enlarging it, if he would preserve and perpetuate our Government and its blessings for the benefit of posterity.
And yet it is proposed by Senator Blair, in his Educational Bill, that, in consideration of $77,000,000 in hand paid, the States should surrender their public-school systems to the virtual censorship of the general Government, and constitute the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Education, a governmental educational Bureau for the oversight of school interests of the United States. Then, in the educational amendment to the Constitution, offered by the same Senator, it is expressly indicated what shall be the character of the public schools which each State shall establish, and what shall be taught therein, with a provision that Congress may enforce its requirements by legislation, when necessary. More than this, in the Sunday-rest Bill, Congress has been asked to take paternal charge of the “Sunday observance” of all persons under its exclusive jurisdiction, m its mail and military service, in inter- State commerce, on the high seas, and throughout the world.

DISTRICT SECRETARY C. Mc REYNOLDS, of Kansas, writes a very encouraging letter from Winfield, in his State. National Reform and Sabbath Union workers have been very active there the past few weeks, but their efforts have developed able and intelligent opposition, in some very unexpected quarters. [159-160]

SUNDAY, April 20, in Salt Lake City, what seems to have been a sort of massmeeting was held to consider “The obligation of the civil authorities to protect the American Sabbath.” The meeting was addressed by Rev. Doctors Vincent, Iliff, Thrall and Mc Neice. The Sunday movement is more than holding its own as a question of national influence.

SUNDAY night, May 4, the Rev. A. B. Kendig, D. D., pastor of the Hanson Place Methodist Episcopal Church, Brooklyn, New York, spoke on the “National Importance of the Sabbath.” One of his statements in regard to those who oppose Sunday laws was this: “We must say to them, ‘If you put your finger upon the Sabbath, you die from among your fellows.’” The gospel of the Sunday-law preachers is altogether a gospel of force.

IT is stated that the late persecution of the Jews in Vienna became so dangerous to all shopkeepers that the city recently appeared covered with such signs as “I am a Christian Tradesman;” “Christian Brandy Shop;” “Christian Cheesemonger;” “Christian Old Clothes Shop.” And that is just what we would see in this country should the hopes of the National Reformers be realized. Every thing would be metaphorically labelled, “Christian.” Every corrupt politician and political “boss” in the country would be a “Christian;” we might reasonably expect the “conversion” of Tammany *en **masse*, and boodle and boodlers would rule the “Church” just as they now manipulate the wards.

THE New York *World* lately secured a unique kind of an interview with United States Senator Ingalls, by which it secured the Senator’s views on a goodly number of interesting questions. The Senator’s statement on one point touches a matter to which we have called attention in these columns considerably of late; that is, the drift toward paternalism in Government. He said:—

> It begins to appear as if individuals had no rights or no private business which the Government was bound to respect. The injustice of society and the inequality of conditions have given an enormous impulse to the idea of nationalism, the control of all economic agencies by the direct interposition of the Government, This is the logical reaction from individualism, on which our system was fonded. The hope that political equality would result in the destruction of poverty and in social fraternity lias not been realized; There are larger private fortunés, there is greater political power in fewer hands; in other words, there is more tyrany in the Republic than in a monarchy. The strongest succeeds more rapidly and more readily here because liberty being common to all, there are no restraints and limitations to overcome. The demand now is, therefore, not that all shall be free, but that all shall be restrained from the full exercise of their faculties and from the enjoyment of their acquisitions.

THE Society of Working Girls held a convention in this city several days ago, and in the convention it was stated that in Philadelphia a girls’ class in stained glass had been stopped by the Glass Workers’ Union, upon which the *Independent *justly remarks:—

“This is an extraordinary statement. We can hardly imagine how it could be done except by terrorizing the teacher who may have been a member of the Glass Workers’ Union. The Union which attempts to prevent children from learning trades, which fights against its own sons and daughters is cowardly and silly as well. The hope of the country rests in the education of its youth into intelligent bread-winning activities.”

ANOTHER important statement made by Senator Ingalls in the *World* interview is the following; it is strictly true and is worthy of careful consideration by those who now are making so much of what they choose to call “Christianity” in politics:—

> The purification of politics is an iridescent dream. Government is force. Politics is a battle for supremacy. Parties are the armies. The decalogue and the golden rule have no place in a political campaign. The object is success. To defeat the antagonist and expel the party in power is the purpose. The Republicans and Democrats are as irreconcilably opposed to each other as were Grant and Lee in the Wilderness. They use ballots instead of guns, but the struggle is as unrelenting and desperate and the result sought for the same. In war it is lawful to deceive the adversary, to hire Hessians, to purchase mercenaries, to mutilate, to kill, to destroy. The commander who lost a battle through the activity of his moral nature would be the derision and jest of history.

SOME time ago the SENTINEL expressed its gratification that the Young Men’s Christian Association had kept itself clear of all the religio-political movements that have arisen. We are now compelled to retract that statement, at least so far as the Young Men’s Christian Association of California is concerned. It seems that the leader of the State Sunday-Law Association there, is a member of the Young Men’s Christian Association, and in his work he assumes to wield the political power of that Association in favor of candidates for the Legislature who will pledge themselves in favor of a Sunday law.

From the *Republican* of Fresno City, California, April 22, 1890, we clip the following editorial note which explains the situation, and which is important upon more than this particular point of the Sunday-law issue:—

> When Dr. Edward Thompson outlined the policy of the Young Men’s Christian Association in politics, on Sunday evening in his lecture on the “Necessity of a Sunday Law,” he gave the Association a responsibility which will cause it considerable trouble, accepting the lecturer’s statement as correct. In regard to the coming political contest in this State the speaker said that while the Association was not a political one in any sense, still they proposed to make their influence felt, by waiting until after legislative candidates were nominated, then they would go to the dominant party and ask its candidate to pledge himself to vote for a Sunday law. In case he would do so they would vote for him, but should he refuse, the energies of voting members of the Young Men’s Christian Association would be United to encompass his defeat. The public at large would like to know if the speaker was authorized to reflect the sentiment of the Fresno branch of the Association.

THE Philadelphia Sabbath Association held its Fiftieth Anniversary, Sunday and Monday, April 27 and 28. Rev. Dr. J. A. Hoyt, pastor of the Chambers Presbyterian Church, delivered the speech of welcome, in which he said:—

> How strange that an institution born with the creation, adorned with moral law and brightened with the light of the resurrection, should need support! Yet it is so, like that other sacred institution of the past, marriage. Man has trampled upon both, and it is necessary to make an effort to force men to realize the great gift of God.

This is just what we have been telling the people for years. We have known all the time that the Sunday-law movement was only an effort to force men to recognize God and the religious obligations of Sunday. Just how much force will be required to cause men fully and properly to realize the great gift of God, Mr. Hoyt did not attempt to tell. That doubtless is left for consideration when the law, and the power to use such force, shall have been obtained. Then how much force shall be used can readily be decided by the ecclesiastical managers.

ALMOST every speech that is made by those who are prominent in the Sundaylaw movement, more fully illustrates the truth that those professed ministers of the gospel have forgotten what the gospel is.

IN proportion as the ecclesiastics become co-legislators, heresies become civil crimes, and liable to civil punishments.—*Dean Milman.*[161]
