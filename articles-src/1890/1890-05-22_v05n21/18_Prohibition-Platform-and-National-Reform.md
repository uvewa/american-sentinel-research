Now that prohibition has become indeed a national question let it be made strictly a political, and not a religious nor yet a religio-political, issue. Let the National Prohibition platform be stripped of its religious, National Reform features, and let it declare for prohibition straight, for prohibition only. Then it ought to win, and THE AMERICAN SENTINEL will do all it can to help it win. But so long as that platform retains its National Reform head, its religious body, and its Sunday tail, THE AMERICAN SENTINEL will be uncompromisingly opposed to it "teeth and toe nail."
