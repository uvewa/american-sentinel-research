THE twenty-fifth anniversary of the National Temperance Society was held in Broadway Tabernacle, this city, Tuesday May 13. The exercises were well attended, especially in the evening when the great building was crowded. The exercises throughout were more like those of a genuine temperance association than any which we have seen for many a day. In fact a genuine temperance organization is just what this Society is. The strong pleas that were made for the restoration of the real, good old temperance meetings and work, in which the effort should be to save men and build up strong individual characters, were in marked and refreshing contrast with the political harangues, the self-glorification, and the mutual admiration speeches of organizations labeled "Christian Temperance." THE AMERICAN SENTINEL heartily wishes the National Temperance Society the most unbounded success.
