THE *Mail and Express* takes Doctor Talmage severely to task for allowing himself to be interviewed, for publication in a Sunday newspaper. But the *Mail and Express* recommends its own Saturday evening's issue for reading on Sunday; and it is certain that in the Talmage interview there was nothing as dull and vapid as the matter of the *Mail and Express *habitually is; and it is likewise certain that there is not a Sunday paper in New York City which does not furnish much better reading than does the Saturday issue, or any other issue, of the *Mail and Express.*
