THE *Dial*, of Oakland, California, is striking some heavy blows against Sunday laws, and all religious legislation. We admire its talent but we cannot fully indorse all that it says, for the reason that it does not properly distinguish between Christianity and much of that which claims to be Christianity. Sunday laws are anti-Christian, and those who advocate them are, though it may be unwittingly, the enemies of the truth as it is in Jesus Christ. The *Dial* should recognize the fact that it is not Christianity but the lack of it which leads the Church to seek the aid of the civil power to support her institutions. Christianity is able, not only to stand alone, but to flourish under persecution. Indeed so true is this that it has been said that "the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church." [169]
