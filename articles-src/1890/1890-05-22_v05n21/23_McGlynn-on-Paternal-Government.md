IN a recent speech at Cooper Union, Dr. Mc Glynn said:—

> We have long since got past the idea of paternal government. We do not believe in a Government that is to feed people till old age with a spoon. We believe in self-government, especially in political matters, and I am free to say that I believe in a great deal of self-government in the Church as well as in the State. The average American must feel his blood boil with indignation at this notion of nursing and coddling the working men and women, being kind to the beggars, taking interest in their moral and spiritual as well as their material welfare.

The Doctor is quite right except in the statement that we have "got past the idea of paternal government." That idea is the bed-rock principle of Romanism, of Mormonism, of Nationalism, and of National Reformism, and as a Nation we are badly afflicted with all of these isms. Indeed paternalism seems to be in the very air. It has been well said, however, that a paternal government is an infernal government for the reason that it must of necessity trench upon the most sacred rights of the individual. The paternal idea of government is that the State decides what is best for the individual, and then undertakes to see that he gets it, whether he wants it or not.
