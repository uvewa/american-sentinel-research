SOME people of Toronto, Canada, sent an address to the Emperor of Germany exhorting him to break loose from all connection with the Pope, and expressing the hope that he has been "chosen of God to strike Romanism its fatal blow." They tell him if he will do this and "march at the head of the advance thought of the hour," that he "shall be more than the Emperor of Germany." He shall, in short, "be one of the leaders of the embattled hosts of God on earth."

We should like to know where these Toronto folks get their authority to appoint leaders of the hosts of God on earth. But from the letter which the Emperor lately wrote to the Pope, we rather think that this exhortation of the people of Toronto will not be given that weight by the Emperor that they would like to have it; even though it be at the risk of the splendid possibilities portrayed in the promise which they make to him.
