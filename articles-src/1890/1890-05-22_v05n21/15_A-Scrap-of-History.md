IN the Convention of the Sunday Union, held in Washington last winter, Mr. Crafts said that in the event of the passage of the Breckinridge Sunday Bill for the District of Columbia, a "law-and-order league" would undoubtedly be established to aid in its enforcement. Dyer and Obion Counties, in Tennessee, where Sunday prosecutions are now going on, had forestalled the Sunday Union, in this particular, as will be seen, by the following extract from the cross-examination of a witness for the prosecution, in the case of *The State of Tennessee v. R. M. King*, lately tried before Judge Swiggart:—

> *Question.*—You say this plowing of his, on that day, created a determination with some, that it would be prosecuted?

> *Answer*—Yes, sir,—ought to be.
> *Question*—Who formed that determination?
> *Answer*—Well, sir, there were several parties; previous
> *Question—*Name them.
> *Answer*—I want to tell you how I got the names, if you will let me.
> *Question—*Just give the names.
> *Answer*—Mr. Dobbins, Mr. Will Wright, and perhaps Mr. Frank Pardue (I am not certain), and Mr. W. R. King, and some others that I don't know that I could name just now.
> *Question*—Of what church are you a member?
> *Answer*—Methodist Church.
> *Question*—Have you named all the. parties that you remember?
> *Answer—*Yes, sir, that is all,—all I could name just now.
> *Question—*At or before this time, had there been a combination, or a written agreement entered into, between you and the parties that you have named, that you would prosecute all violations of Sunday laws?
> *Answer*—Yes, sir, there had.
> *Question*—Have you ever had anybody else indicted or arrested, or charged, except Seventh-day Adventists?
Objected to.

> *Colonel Richardson*—I am asking this, with a view to show the *animus* of these witnesses, and their feelings against this particular man. I expect to show why Mr. Cole (as he said they had) entered into a compact to prosecute all the parties who violated the Sunday laws. I expect to prove by Mr. Cole, that divers parties (and, if not by him, by others) who are not Seventh-day Adventists, cut wheat and did all sorts of work on the Sabbath, desecrating it generally, and that nobody has been prosecuted or interfered with, except this remnant of Israel. (Hisses.)

> *Court*—Ask him if he has any feeling against this defendant, if you want to. I sustain the objection. (Defendant excepts. )
