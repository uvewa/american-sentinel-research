A DISPATCH gives the information that the Governor of California has "pardoned an innocent man." That is a most singular proceeding, though it is not the first time that it has been attempted by executives in the States. Pardon necessarily implies guilt. If the man was innocent, of what then could he have possibly been pardoned? It will be said that the man had been convicted and sentenced by the State, though innocent, and in order to release him it was necessary to pardon him. Not at all. There is no place for pardon in the case. When the State convicted a man who was innocent, then the State did wrong. And when the State discovered that it had done the wrong, even though it were mistakenly and unintentionally, the only proper thing to do was to issue a public apology, and a proclamation fully exonerating the innocent man who had suffered such grievous injury. To offer a pardon in such a case is only to add insult to injury. To offer a pardon in such a case is both to charge and to convict of the crime of which it is proposed to pardon the man. And for a man to accept pardon in such a case is to confess guilt. It would be well for governors at such times to bear in mind what justice is, and to be just before they undertake to be generous. It is impossible to pardon an innocent man.
