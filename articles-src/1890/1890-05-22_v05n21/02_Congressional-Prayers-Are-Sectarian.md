THE *Christian Statesman* mentions the "explicit Christian tone" of the prayers in Congress, and then says:—

> They are the official and formal acknowledgment of the Christian religion by the Legislature of the Nation. If the decision of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, that the Bible is a sectarian book, is good American doctrine, then these prayers are also sectarian.

Precisely. That is just what they are; and to take the public money with which to pay for such prayers is to appropriate public funds to sectarian uses. Congress has no more right to spend the public money for this purpose than it has to build a Christian meeting-house, or to pay for the preaching of Christian sermons.
