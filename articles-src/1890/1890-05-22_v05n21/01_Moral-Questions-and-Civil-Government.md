"MORAL questions," says the National Reform Declaration of Principles, "cannot be determined by majorities; otherwise morals might be reversed at every election." This is true and it is just the reason why civil Government has no business to meddle with morals. We marvel that all cannot see this. Government can and should require all men to practice civility, but morality is beyond the jurisdiction of earthly governments and earthly courts.
