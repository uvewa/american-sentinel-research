A PACKAGE of petitions from Michigan, has been received in Washington, by the secretary of the National Religious Liberty Association, with a note attached which reads as follows:—

> I circulated this petition in my school district. All signed it.

Such thorough work as this, is encouraging, especially when it is remembered that all these are enabled, by the leaflet, "My reasons for signing the petition against religious legislation," which they receive, to understand more fully and defend the position which they have taken.
