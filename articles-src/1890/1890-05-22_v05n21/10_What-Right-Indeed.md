WHAT right have our State and city governments for their exempting church properties from the regular law of taxation? Not only is such exemption against the spirit of our Constitution, but also against the letter of the New Testament. "My kingdom is not of this world," said Christ, "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God, the things that are God's." Were the churches to render unto Caesar what belongs to Caesar, were they to pay to the Government the taxes that belong to the Government, that injustice would be wiped out of our statute books which exempts from taxation a vast amount of the very finest property in our land, that aggregates a value of hundreds upon hundreds of millions of dollars, and that is, almost without an exception, owned by rich corporations, while the poor washerwoman has her hovel sold over her head by the sheriff, if she cannot pay the paltry sum levied on it for taxes. "In the city of New York, Trinity Episcopal Church owns a block of land one-fourth of a mile wide by three-fourths of a mile long, valued at $25,000,000. Taxed equally with other property it would contribute $750,000 per annum to support the State—but being exempt, this amount goes to the church coffers; and the people of New York who are taxed the extra amount in order to make good this deficiency, positively pay $2,000 a year for the religious instruction of each attendant at Trinity Church." And the injustice appears still more flagrant when we consider that most of this property is not used at all for religious purposes, but is rented out for offices, stores, warehouses, and, if report be true, for some very illegitimate business. And this is only one church corporation within one denomination. Now consider the value of the church property owned by all the Episcopalians, by the Catholics, Methodists, Baptists, and all the other denominations, and you may have some conception of the amount of church tax exemption in a country where Church and State are totally separated.

If this is a Government in which Church and State are totally separated, what right has it to employ chaplains to offer up sectarian prayers in behalf of people to whom such supplications are objectionable, prayers that are, as a rule, never listened to, never heeded, except they partake of the nature of a stump-speech, or when the chaplains introduce some spicy sensationalism, or when they proceed to give to God, or to his Son, some practical suggestions as to what course He should pursue in connection with the commonwealth? This farce that is going on every day, is not only against the spirit of the organic law of this country, but also a positive blasphemy, and to keep it agoing our National, and our State Governments expend more than $50,000 annually of the people's money.

If this is a Government in which Church and State are totally separated, what right has the President to assume the role of high priest of the Nation, and issue a proclamation, asking the people to assemble in their respective places of worship for a Thanksgiving-service unto God? Fancy Col. Robert G. Ingersoll, the agnostic, Prof. Felix Adler, the ethical culturist, Senator John J. Ingalls the unbeliever, (if report be true) elected President of the United States, fancy one of 'these assuming the role of high priest, bidding the people to do that which he has fought and ridiculed for years, and you may realize the absurdity of a thanksgiving or a fast-day proclamation by the chief Executive in a Nation, in which every native-born citizen, no matter what his belief, is eligible to the Presidential office, and in a Nation that is amply provided with religious organizations, and each amply supplied with provisions for thanksgiving and fast-day service.

What right has a State government, if this is a country in which Church and State are totally separated, to consecrate Good Friday as a legal holiday? or to interfere with its citizens spending their weekly day of rest and recreation in the manner most agreeable to themselves, as long as they remain within the limits of the law? What right has it to make unjust discriminations between its citizens, legislating only in favor of orthodox church people, and cruelly disregarding the rights of those who are just as loyal as the church people, even though they do not share their peculiar, gloomy Puritanic Sabbath doctrines?—*Our Pulpit.*
