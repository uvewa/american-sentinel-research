IN an article on this subject in last week's SENTINEL, it was shown by quotations from an article in the *Christian Statesman*, by Rev. N. R. Johnston, that under the proposed National Reform Government "the whole moral law as summed up in the ten commandments, and the whole moral Mosaic penal code, would be the rule of action in Congress, in State Legislatures, and in the courts of justice." It was also shown by the same authority, that these so-called reformers expect by this means to "keep out of office all ungodly and wicked men," that is all who make no profession of Christianity, and that they propose that idol worship, profanity, blasphemy, Sabbath breaking, disobedience to parents, intemperance, polygamy, adultery, prostitution, gambling, etc., shall "be punished as the divine law requires." It is the purpose of the present article to examine this matter a little and see what, according to their own showing, would be the nature of the punishments which National Reformers would in the event of securing the much-coveted power, inflict upon those whom they should adjudge guilty of violation of the divine law.

Blasphemy is one of the sins which Mr. Johnston Says would, under the National Reform *regime*, be punished "as the divine law requires." But first what is blasphemy? Blasphemy is defined by Webster as:—

> An indignity offered to God by words or writing; reproachful, contemptuous, or irreverent words uttered impiously against God.

Profanity, Webster defines thus:—

> The quality or character of being profane; profaneness; irreverence; especially the use of profane language; blasphemy.

It appears, therefore, that in the common acceptation of the word, blasphemy is synonymous with profanity; yet Mr. Johnston enumerates profanity as though it were another and different sin. It follows that he must have purposed by the use of the word blasphemy, which in his list of sins to be punished by the State occurs after the word profanity, to convey an additional meaning not contained in the word profanity. Let us then inquire what that meaning is. After giving his own definition of blasphemy, Webster quotes the following from Bouvier:—

> Blasphemy is to attribute to God that which is contrary to his nature, and does not belong to him, and to deny what does.

In this sense every man who has a different conception of God from that which his neighbor has, blasphemes, in the estimation of that neighbor, if he gives expression to that conception. Thus, in the eyes of the Trinitarian, the Unitarian blasphemes when he denies the divinity of Christ and the personality of the Holy Spirit. Likewise, the literalist blasphemes, according to the generally accepted idea of God, when he teaches that God is a literal being having body, parts, and passions. The atheist also blasphemes when he denies the existence of an intelligence commonly known as God, no matter how chaste the words in which that denial may be expressed. Thus, in the sense contained in Bouvier's definition, blasphemy is the assertion of some conception of the Deity which conflicts with the generally accepted conception of the divine Being, or the denial of the prevailing, or legal, conception of that Being. This must be what Mr. Johnston means by the use of the word since it is all that is contained in it more than is contained in the word profanity, which he had previously used in the same enumeration of sins.

Let us then inquire how, under the proposed National Reform system of government, this crime of differing from the majority or from the powers that be as to the being and attributes of Deity would be punished. Mr. Johnston says, "As required by the divine law." Turning then to that law we read (Lev. 24:16):—

> And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put to death.

Death by stoning is then the penalty which National Reform would inflict for blasphemy, an offense which consists only in thoughts and words either written or spoken. And yet Mr. Johnston and his friends have been very much grieved in the past, because they have been accused of desiring a union of Church and State, and because it has been asserted that in the event of their movement being successful persecution for conscience' sake must result.

Profanity, by which we presume is meant profane swearing, or cursing, is also punishable by death by stoning, as will appear by reference to Leviticus 24:10, 14. Death was also the penalty for Sabbath breaking (Num. 15:32-36), for adultery (Lev. 20:10), for disobedience to parents (Deut. 21:19-21), and for idolatry (Deut. 11:6-10). According to Mr. Johnston all these would, therefore, under the proposed National Reform Government, be punished by stoning to death.

But some of the sins which Mr. Johnston says would "be punished as the divine law requires," were permitted under the theocracy, and no punishment is specified for them in the Old Testament: Polygamy, for instance, was quite common in Old Testament times, and it is only in the light of the New Testament that it clearly appears as sin. It follows that if our Reform friends punish polygamy "as the divine law requires" they must punish it according to that which shows it to be sin. Let us see how this would be.

According to the New Testament polygamy is adultery, and by referring to Matthew, 5:27-30, and comparing it with Mark 9:43-48 it will be seen that according to the teaching of Christ adultery is punishable by casting into hell fire. The original word used here is *gehenna.* This is supposed by many to refer to a place of eternal torment, but primarily it referred, as stated by Greenfield, to "the valley of Hinnom, South of Jerusalem, once celebrated for the horrid worship of Moloch, and afterwards polluted with every species of filth, as well as the carcasses of animals and dead bodies of malefactors; to consume which, in order to avert the pestilence which such a mass of corruption would occasion, constant fires were kept burning." This makes it clear that that form, at least, of adultery which is clearly shown only by the New Testament to be adultery, must be punished by burning, if it is to be punished "as the divine law requires." And since the fires in the Valley of Hinnom are long since extinct, and men have not access to the lake of fire supposed to be typified by those fires, it follows that they who would attempt to punish sins as the divine law of the New Testament requires, must kindle their own fires just as they were kindled in the sixteenth century at Smithfield to punish violations of the divine law as expounded by the Papal Church and administered by Bloody Mary. [164]

It is no wonder that Mr. Johnston thinks that this "would tend powerfully to the suppression of existing evil." Powerful remedies are expected to exert a powerful influence; but in this case it is more than doubtful if the influence would be that which the National Reformers imagine that it would be. Nothing but the grace of God will keep men from sin no matter what the consequences may be, and that grace is not imparted by legislative enactment, nor by fear of the stake. It is the goodness of God that leads men to repentance, and nowhere has he commissioned either his ministers or the State to drive men to repentance by burning or stoning, or even by fines and imprisonment. The great trouble with these men is that they fail to distinguish between moral government and civil government, between the government of God and human governments, between a divinely established and divinely administered theocracy, and a man-made and humanly administered counterfeit theocracy. In a true theocracy God himself is the ruler; in a man-made theocracy men rule in the name of God, but not by his authority, just as popes and kings ruled in the Dark Ages till "drunken with the blood of saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus."

National Reformers have denied that persecution would result from the success of their movement, but in the light of such statements as those published from time to time in the *Christian Statesman*, and of which Mr. Johnston's utterances are only a fair sample, such denials amount to nothing, and the fact remains that the logic of their scheme stops nothing short of the fagot and the stake. Of course they would not call it persecution; the Catholics never persecuted; they only adjudged people to be guilty of violation of the civil law and then turned them over to the civil authorities to be punished for the good of the State, and as a warning, to evil doers. And this is just what the National Reformers propose. They would not persecute; no, not they; they would only have the civil authorities put people to death for not agreeing with the majority in matters of religion.

Nor is this, bad as it is, the worst feature of this proposed Reform government. The divine law, they say, is to be made the rule of action in the courts of justice. That is, the meaning and the scope of the divine law are to be determined by civil tribunals; and not only so but they must decide what constitutes violations of the divine law. And as that law takes cognizance not only of outward acts but of the thoughts and intents of the heart (Heb. 4:12; Matt. 5:21-28); it follows, therefore, that under the proposed National Reform *regime* men are to be constituted judges, not only of human actions and words, but of human thoughts as well, with power to punish, even to the death, thoughts which they may judge to be contrary to the divine law. It was this same principle followed to its logical conclusion that gave rise to the Inquisition; and it must result in bitter persecution wherever followed, for human nature has not changed. It matters not that men are honest, that they really think that they are doing God service. The Saviour said to his followers, "The time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service." That was literally true in the Dark Ages and it may be even so again. No man can be assured that he will not become a persecutor unless he steadily refuses all power over the consciences of his fellow-men, and sternly represses within his own heart the first risings of desires to coerce others in matters of duty toward God. The National Reformers are demanding authority which belongs alone to God. Should they ever attain it, they would exercise it just as such power has always been exercised by those who usurped it. The spirit of compulsion is always and everywhere opposed to the Spirit of Christ, and so far as the National Reformers cherish it they are anti-Christian.C. P. B.
