# Why?

WHY should *anything* based upon the word of God ask for support other than that word? It cannot. It is only when we realize weakness in ourselves that we look elsewhere for support. When the Church asks the civil power to compel people to yield obedience to her ordinances, then those ordinances have become *forms,* and forms only, lacking in power to affect the heart, and inspire the life.

This is no less true of one ordinance than of another. Shall civil power compel people to be baptized and join the Church? No! Then, shall it compel people to keep the Sabbath? If the Church has lost her power to convert the heart, so that it shall yield *willing* obedience to her Lord; if she must ask civil power to compel service to her forms; then how sadly yet truly are the words of Paul being fulfilled, “Having a* form* of godliness but denying the *power* thereof.” MRS. M. J. BAHLER.

IN speaking of the last days of the Roman Republic, Tacitus remarks that “laws were not made for the public only; but for particular men,”—the idea being that the public good was not the first thought, but that political advantage took precedence, and that those who had the making of the laws would play into the hands of particular men, or classes of men, in order to secure their support: and that, on the other hand, particular men or classes looked only to their own interests, to their own advantage, and not to the public good.

To any one who has watched the course of legislation in the United States for the last few years, it will not be difficult to detect the growth of a condition of things which is becoming more and more precisely parallel with that to which Tacitus refers. It is becoming more and more a serious fact that in our Legislatures, laws are not made for the public only, but for particular men.
