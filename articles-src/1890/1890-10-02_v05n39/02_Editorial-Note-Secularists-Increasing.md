AFTER speaking of the adherence of Seventh-day Adventists to the secular theory of government, the *Christian Statesman* says:—

> Many other Christian people, including many ministers of religion, are intelligent and thoroughgoing secularists in their political beliefs.

Certainly they are; and their numbers are rapidly increasing. Nor is this strange, since the attention of thousands is now being called to this question who never before gave it a serious thought.
