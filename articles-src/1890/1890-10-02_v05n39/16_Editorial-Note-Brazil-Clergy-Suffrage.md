THE *Truth Seeker* thinks that clergymen should not be disfranchised as they are under the new *regime* in Brazil. It says:—

> It is not right, though it may be expedient considering the character of the clergy and their proneness to maneuver for the aggrandizement of the Church. Ministers should be treated the same as other men. . . . Give them freedom and suffrage, treat them as though they were not dependents, and they will come out all right in time.

Government should be purely secular, and should give itself not the least concern about the religion or religious calling of its subjects.
