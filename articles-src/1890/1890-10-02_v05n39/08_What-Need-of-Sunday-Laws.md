# What Need of Sunday Laws?

HON. H. SCOTT HOWELL, in the June *Evangel of Rest*, says:—

> The Divine, with infinite wisdom, requires us to “Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy;” and every citizen, however humble he may be, whether rich or poor, whether black or white, who in obedience to this divine law, engages in acts of devotion and worship, in his own home or in the public assembly, may do so in this free country “with none to molest or make him afraid.”

Referring to Mr. Howell’s words, a Des Moines, Iowa, paper asks the following pertinent questions:—

> If the above is true, what force is there in the pathetic appeals of the American Sabbath Union to Congress for laws to give the poor laboring man a chance to rest, and go to church? And if all, rich or poor, black or white, *may, if they will*, obey the divine law of the Sabbath, “with none to molest or make them afraid,” what is the object of all this clamor for Sabbath legislation?

WHATEVER may be true of Protestants in other lands, the Protestants of the United States are unqualifiedly opposed to any union of Church and State, even such a union as is involved when the State undertakes to give the simplest instruction in religion. But it becomes evident that, if the State is going to undertake to give complete education to all its citizens, one of two things must follow: either there must be no religious instruction and we must rear generations of agnostics and atheists, or else it must teach doctrines against which a considerable portion of the citizens protest. Neither of these things ought to be. It is the business of the Christian people of this land, and of any land, to see to it that the atmosphere breathed by their children, while acquiring the education which is to fit them for the present life, be such as shall conduce to their religious as well as to their mental growth, that heart and mind be cultivated at the same time.—*Journal and Messenger (Baptist),* *Cincinnati.*

THE Rev. Frank Dixon, pastor of the Tenth Avenue Baptist Church, Oakland, in a recent sermon on “The Sabbath,” touched the heart of the greater part of the fancied devotion to Sunday, in the following words:—

> Was our religion so inseparable from the Sunday of our fathers that it vanished with the desecration of that day? Going down to the bottom of the matter, have we been worshiping a day or Jesus Christ? Then, too, we cannot help asking ourselves if a large part of the reverence with which we have viewed Sunday has not been rendered to our fathers who bequeathed us the day, rather than to any sanctity which we discovered in the day.

It is ancestor-worship instead of devotion to the day for its own sake, in a large degree. Mr. Dixon does not believe that Sunday is any more sacred than any other day, but that all days are alike; but yet he finds ground for State Sunday laws. Great is consistency, but greater yet is custom.—*Signs of the Times.*
