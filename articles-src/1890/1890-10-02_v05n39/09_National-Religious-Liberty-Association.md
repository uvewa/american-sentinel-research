# National Religious Liberty Association.

## Declaration Of Principles.

> We believe in the religion taught by Jesus Christ.

> We believe in temperance, and. regard the liquor traffic as a curse to society.
> We believe in supporting the civil government, and submitting to its authority.
> We deny the right of any civil government to legislate on religious questions.
> We believe it is the right, and should be the privilege, of every man to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience.
> We also believe it to be our duty to use every lawful and honorable means to prevent religious legislation by the civil government; that we and our fellow-citizens may enjoy the inestimable blessings of both religious and civil liberty.
C. ELDREDGE,*President.*

W. H. MCKEE,*Secretary.*

A LONDON despatch says that Cardinal Manning has written a letter to the Social Science Congress, in session at Liege, Belgium, urging among other things, that the observance of Sunday be enforced. At every public gathering, both in this country and Europe, where it is possible to present and advocate the claims of Sunday for legal acknowledgment and enforced observance, ministers and prelates of ability and eminence, in church circles, are found ready to press the subject with all their power and subtilty. It cannot be long before the result of this will become so evident that even the wayfaring men, who are absorbed in running the world’s race, will be able to read the signs of the times.

AN Iowa paper, favorable to the objects of the National Religious Liberty Association, has the following note:—

> Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts gave three lectures in Des Moines, Sunday, and one, Monday evening. His coming was a surprise, his announcements not being made till within a few hours before he delivered his first address. Our readers understand the object of such a course, but they may be assured that Rev. Crafts’s hearers will be bountifully supplied with National Religious Liberty reading-matter, even if the distribution has to *follow* the lectures.

It is hard for Mr. Crafts to kick against the pricks, but he may as well make up his mind that he cannot have a monopoly of teaching upon the Sunday-law question. If he believes his cause just, he should not fear full and free discussion.

AT a regular meeting of the Board of Managers of the National Temperance Society, held recently in New York, the following resolution was passed, and the Secretary directed To transmit a copy to the Commissioners of the World’s Fair, at Chicago:—

> *Resolved,* That the Board of Managers of the National Temperance Society, in behalf of its membership throughout the Nation, earnestly protests against the opening of the World’s Fair on the Sabbath day.

Is the National Temperance Society about to swing into line with the National Reform Party? The Sunday Union, the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, the King’s Daughters, the Young People’s Society of Christian Endeavor, are already bound in the political compact. If the National Temperance Society joins the great conspiracy against religious freedom and Christianity undefiled, the only organizations still remaining neutral will be the Young Men’s Christian Association, the Salvation Army, the Labor Unions, and the secret societies.

It may be said that this resolution is intended to be in the interest of temperance. It is not so worded. But if so, it is time the National Temperance Society learned that it cannot associate itself with the movement to enforce religious formality by civil measures, and establish, in any degree, an enforced political religion, and at the same time expect to serve acceptably, either God or the cause of temperance.

MR. B. L. DIFFENBACHER, 1201 Market Street, Sioux City, Iowa, wishes Religious Liberty reading matter for free distribution during the Corn Palace Carnival, in that city, September 25, to October 11. Unsoiled copies of the AMERICAN SENTINEL or numbers of the “Sentinel Library,” will be thankfully received, and judiciously used. Send by mail or express, prepaid, to the above address.

“CURIOUS proposition that,” says the *World,* “to make Texas fever non-contagious and non-infectious, by a Congressional vote. Some people think Congress is like Parliament, able to do anything but make a man a woman.” But curious as is such a proposition, it is neither more curious nor more absurd than is the National Reform proposition to make this a Christian nation, by inserting in the Constitution a complimentary mention of God.

THE result of the recent election in one of the Southern States, is thus announced by the *Sun:—*

> The Hon. James P. Eagle, Democrat and Baptist, was elected Governor of Arkansas, yesterday, defeating the Hon. Napoleon Bonaparte Fizer, Union Labor, Republican, and Methodist.

We may as well get used to this sort of thing, for should the hopes of the National Reformers be realized, the religion professed by the various candidates will become a matter of more than passing curiosity.

THE *Sun*, of this city, notes the fact that there were two meetings in Chicago, on a recent Sunday, to protest against opening the World’s Fair on Sundays, and remarks upon it that “this seems somewhat premature and immature. It is far from certain as yet, that the World’s Fair will be open on week days. The Chicago Sabbatarians are tugging at Time’s forelock most unnecessarily.” It would appear that the self-instituted Sabbath Observance Department, of the World’s Columbian Exposition, is trying to prove the truth of the old adage, “It is better to be ready and not go; than to go and not be ready.”

THE Cleveland correspondent of the *Christian Advocate*, of this city, writes to that paper, as follows:—

> The Epworth League continues the effort to secure a Christian Sabbath for Cleveland. The enemies are strongly intrenched, and it is being realized that resolutions and spasms are not very effective. It is now proposed to secure the co-operation of all the young people’s societies in all the churches in the city, not excepting the Roman Catholic, and to direct the effort so far as possible to secure the election of men to official places who will enforce the law. It was of the Acts of the Apostles that Luke wrote, and we shall be glad to report further acts of this aggressive League.

This paragraph is interesting as showing the progress that the Sunday cause is making, and the efforts that are being put forward in its behalf. Just what force there is in the reference to the fact that Luke wrote the Acts of the Apostles we confess that we do not see.

THOSE who are being seduced into the support of Sunday laws by the “civil Sabbath” plea, should make a note of these words from the *Christian Advocate, *of this city:—

> To open the fair on the Sabbath would be to offer an open indignity to all the Christian people of America. They all consider the Sabbath a holy day set apart for religious purposes. They consider themselves bound to keep it holy.

There is not much “civil Sabbath” about that. The “civil Sabbath” which Mr. Crafts has been proclaiming all over the land is simply “a good enough Morgan” till the desired legislation is secured. Then the mask will be thrown aside, and it will be seen that we have laws compelling people who are not religious to act, in some things at least, as though they were.

WE are asked if we wish our readers to understand that we think that all drinking of intoxicating beverages should be abolished? and if we would carry prohibition so far as to forbid the use of intoxicating wine in the holy communion? We will simply say that we are opposed to the liquor traffic, and believe that there are ample civil reasons why the State should abolish the saloon; but just how* far* prohibition should be carried, we are not prepared to say; that is, our study of the matter does not qualify us to speak *excathedra* upon so difficult a question. It seems to us, however, that to prohibit the traffic in alcoholic beverages, and their manufacture for the purpose of traffic, is about all the State could justly do. It would seem that to carry prohibition to the length intimated by our correspondent, would be an unwarranted invasion not only of religious rights, but of proper personal, civil rights.

“THE new Citizens’ Movement in the city of New York, for ousting Tammany Hall from the control of city affairs, fell into a serious error,” says the *Christian Advocate,* “in using Archbishop Corrigan’s name. Not only did they place his name in the list of clergymen who support the movement, but put him at the head of a committee of clergymen, one of whose members is a Catholic priest who is in a contentious attitude toward his church. The committee has been ordered to withdraw it at once. It now appears his name was used in the first place without securing his consent, but simply on the theory that he was favorable to the movement. Such use of any man’s name is an imposition. Never without express consent given after full opportunity of reading the document, should any person’s name be signed to it.” There is a good deal too much of that sort of thing done, and nowhere is it more common than among those who attempt to engineer political matters from a religious standpoint. Such unwarranted use of names is very common with the National Reformers. It is not at all reassuring to know that the Citizens’ Movement has been guilty of it in the very outset of the cause of reform. Moral reformers should be scrupulously honest.

ONE of the neatest and best books which we have seen in a long time, is “Jottings from the Pacific. Fiji and Samoa.” By Emma H. Adams, author of “To and Fro in Southern California,” and “Up and Down in Oregon and Washington.” This book, which is handsomely illustrated, is printed in large clear type, on excellent paper, and is substantially bound in cloth, beautifully embossed in jet and gold. It contains 160 pages of not only absolutely unobjectionable, but highly interesting and profitable matter, descriptive of Fiji and Samoa, and giving glimpses of native life in those interesting islands. No parent can do better than to place such books in the hands of his children, and thus cultivate in them a taste for good reading.

This book is the initial number of the “Young People’s Library,” and judging from this number and from the promises of the publishers, we feel confident that this library will greatly assist thousands of anxious parents to answer with satisfaction to themselves, and profit to their children, the vexed question, “What shall our children read?”

The “Young People’s Library” will be issued monthly, each volume containing 160 pages of uniform size, in two styles of binding, namely, paper, and cloth embossed in jet and gold. The subscription price is $2.75 per year, for the paper, and $5.50 for the cloth binding. Single copies are twenty-five and fifty cents, respectively. Pacific Press, Oakland, Cal., New York, N. Y., and London, England. [297]
