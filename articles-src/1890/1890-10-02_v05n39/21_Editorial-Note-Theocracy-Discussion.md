THE *Christian Statesman* has an editorial note, which says:—

> We have never seen the Hebrew theocracy fully and correctly discussed. Foolish and incorrect ideas on the subject pervade our literature, and are heard continually on the platform, and even in the pulpit.

This is quite an acknowledgment. We have long known that National Reform literature was pervaded by foolish and incorrect ideas of a theocracy, but we had scarcely looked for such a frank acknowledgment of this fact from the *Christian Statesman.* What is said of the platform and pulpit is no doubt equally true; we are well aware that National Reform speakers are very prone to "foolish and incorrect ideas," and not only so, but they have a fondness for parading them before the public.
