FELIX R. BRUNOT, President of the National Reform Association, has issued a call for a conference on "the Christian principles of civil government," "to be held in Nashville, Tennessee, on, or about, the 15th of February next." The conference should also consider the Christian principles of the Golden Rule. A conscientious study of that matchless Rule, in Nashville, might lead to a repeal of the wicked and oppressive Sunday law which now disgraces the State of Tennessee.
