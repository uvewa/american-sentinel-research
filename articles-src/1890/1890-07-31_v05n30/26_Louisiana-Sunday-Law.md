THE Louisiana Legislature has had before it a substitute for the State Sunday law, in the form of a bill giving to police juries and municipal corporations throughout the State the power to regulate all Sunday trade, etc. The measure is really local option applied to the Sunday question. The bill passed the Legislature, but was vetoed by the Governor.

The *Pearl of Days* noticing the bill, says, "It is a measure that no friend of the Sabbath ought to approve." Certainly no National Reformer would approve it; the aim of that party is to centralize the control of all the moral questions in which they interest themselves, into one infallible, papal head, and no such approach to individual freedom of choice, as local option even, could be permitted in their politics.
