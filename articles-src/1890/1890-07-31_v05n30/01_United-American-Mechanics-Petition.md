THE Order of United American Mechanics is petitioning Congress largely, for "an amendment to the Constitution, which shall prevent the States from enacting laws for the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." This is an evidence that the practical people of the United States are waking up to the dangers and exigencies of the times.
