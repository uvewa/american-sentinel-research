THE *Voice* says that "although Francis Murphy is dead set against prohibition a resolution was unanimously passed at one of his South Omaha meetings, last week, calling upon Mayor Sloan to enforce the prohibition laws on Sunday." Yes; love for Sunday, and laws for its enforcement, take precedence of all opposition to the liquor traffic, in the minds of thousands of people both in and out of the Prohibition Party.
