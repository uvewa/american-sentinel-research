THE St. Paul *Dispatch* supports the decision of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, in the Edgerton Bible case, and says: "In view of the severity with which the founders of our constitutional systems plainly regarded all possibility of interference with individual religious belief or individual right of conscience, it is safe to say, that the proper and the more advisable course in the discharge of the duty of the State, to afford secular instruction to its citizens, is to wholly eliminate all form of religious instruction, and leave the discharge of that duty where- it rightfully belongs, with the parents of the several children."
