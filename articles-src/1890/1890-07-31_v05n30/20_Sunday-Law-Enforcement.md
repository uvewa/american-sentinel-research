THE *Advocate*, a prohibition journal of Watertown, this State, is calling for the more vigorous enforcement of existing Sunday laws. Speaking of the growing disregard of Sunday, the *Advocate* says: "If allowed to go on unchecked, a Continental Sabbath, or a Sabbath without regard to a law compelling a suspension of business, will be substituted in this country instead of the Sabbath of our fathers. Against such an innovation we strongly protest."
