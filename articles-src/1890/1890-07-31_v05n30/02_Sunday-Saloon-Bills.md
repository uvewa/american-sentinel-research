THERE are at present, four bills before Congress, having in view the closing of saloons on Sunday in the District of Columbia. One has passed the Senate and gone to the House, two have been introduced in the House, and still another has just been introduced in the Senate. The entire Sunday movement seems, at this time, to be concentrated upon the closing of the saloon on Sunday, totally regardless of the mantle of legal charity which it thus throws over the liquor traffic for the remaining six days of the week.
