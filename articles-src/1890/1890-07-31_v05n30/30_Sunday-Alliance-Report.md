THE Sunday Alliance, of Scotland, communicates to the Sunday Union, of the United States, a report of the progress of the work of the Alliance for the past year in Scotland; a paragraph is devoted to the commendation of the American Sunday Union, and the *Mail and Express.* Thus steadily are these forces for the promotion of political religion joining hands round the world.
