# No Need of Sunday Legislation.

THE *Examiner* (Baptist) of this city, had an article some time since on “The Need of Sunday Legislation,” in which some ideas worthy of notice were advocated. The article is a review of a paragraph or two from an article in a secular paper expressing the sentiment that no laws should be made in regard to Sunday, and that consequently everybody should do as they please about observing it. This, the *Examiner* thinks, would be utterly destructive of all Sunday observance. That paper admits, however, that “no laws should be made enforcing the religious observance of Sunday.”

Just what those who say they are in favor of Sunday laws, but not in favor of enforcing the “religious observance” of the day, mean, we do not know. Sunday is purely a religious institution. It is observed because it is a religious institution, and how any observance of it whatever can be enforced without enforcing a religious observance, is more than we can understand. It is true that no law can compel anyone to have a real regard for Sunday, and possibly the advocates of Sunday laws would regard nothing short of that as religious observance; but any law that prohibits secular occupations on Sunday, compels people to act as though they had a sacred regard for the day, and what is that but religious observance as far as it goes?

The *Examiner* argues that Sunday laws are necessary in order to afford those an opportunity to rest who desire to do so. To prove this, it cites the case of the Saturday half-holiday in this city, of which it says:—

> For several years, by a concerted action, some few large firms in the same lines of business adopted a system of early closing during the summer, but the practice was by no means general, and it had no sure basis until a statute made Saturday afternoon a legal holiday. When all banks and public offices closed at noon on Saturday, it was found not only practicable to close private offices and shops, but of little use to keep them open, and so the half-holiday became assured as a summer institution, and is more and more generally observed with every year.

But instead of proving the necessity of Sunday laws, this proves conclusively that no such laws are required further than to make Sunday a legal holiday. There is no law forbidding work upon Saturday afternoon; the law simply makes [220] Saturday afternoon a legal holiday, and banks, courts, etc., must of necessity suspend business, because business done at that time would not be legal. But to make Sunday *dies non* would not satisfy Sunday-law advocates. This is exactly the case with Sunday in California. It is a legal holiday, no public business is done and would not be legal if it were done, and yet, Sunday advocates say that California has no Sunday law, and they are demanding that a Sunday law be enacted in that State. The truth is, that that which they want is a statutory recognition of Sunday as a sacred day. And that, they say, would not be religious legislation!C. P. B.
