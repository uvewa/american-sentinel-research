THE Pittsburgh *Christian Advocate* is not pleased with the present administration. It says:—

> We confess to very great disappointment in the religious features of President Harrison's administration. He is a Christian man, an officer, and for years a Sabbath-school teacher in the Presbyterian Church. Much was expected of him in the way of proper example in his high office, and of respect for the Christian principles and sentiment of the country. But in some respects we have not seen them. Intoxicating liquors have been served on his table on State occasions, and lately a "german," one of the most offensive and disgusting of all the public dances, was given in the White House. It was a full dress (rather undress) affair, such as but few thoughtful mothers would suffer their daughters to attend. Chaplain Milburn says there has not been any such public exhibition in the presidential mansion since the marriage of President Tyler. Pretty soon the people will wonder what the difference is between a Christian president and one who is not a Christian.

This illustrates the evil of calling any man a "Christian president." People *will *wonder what difference there is between a "Christian president" and one who is not "Christian;" and the conclusion arrived at is likely to be, that a "Christian president" is one who makes a profession of religion, and is governed by the policy of his party and the customs of Washington society, while a non-Christian president is one who makes no profession and is governed in just the same way.
