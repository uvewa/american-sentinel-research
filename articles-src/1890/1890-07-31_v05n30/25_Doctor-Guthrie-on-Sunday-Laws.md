DOCTOR GUTHRIE, the eminent Presbyterian divine, is credited with this statement:—

> I counted in Paris thirty-three theaters and places of amusement, open on the Sabbath day, but in one hour I saw in Edinburg, with all her schools, churches, and piety, more drunkenness than I saw in Paris in five months.

This shows that Sunday laws are practically worthless as a temperance measure; if people are in the habit of drinking, and have opportunity to get liquor six days in the week it is useless to attempt to keep it from them on Sunday.
