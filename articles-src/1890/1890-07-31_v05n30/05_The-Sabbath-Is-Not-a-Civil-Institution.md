# The Sabbath Is Not a Civil Institution.

I NOTICED recently an article in defense of Sabbath laws by Hon. E. L. Pan- cher, LL. D., entitled, “The Sabbath as a Civil Institution,” which set me to thinking. The drift of the argument seems to be that as the “Christian Sabbath is observed and well established in the United States,” and is “regulated by laws passed to secure the good order of society,” that it is therefore a “civil institution,” and “is a *right* of the citizen that it should be observed as a day of cessation from labor, and of quiet and order.”

Now I cannot possibly see any logic in these statements. The mere fact that it is observed and well established, and protected by laws does not prove that it is either the Sabbath or [221] a civil institution. When we come to examine the Sabbath as a religious institution, we want better authority than its being “observed and well established” in any nation. If that argument be true, the Sabbath of the Mohammedan is just as much the Sabbath or a civil institution, as the Sabbath of the Christian, Mr. Pancher to the contrary notwithstanding, for that day *is* “observed and well established” among that people. But it is not my purpose to examine in regard to whether Sunday is the Sabbath or not; I desire to examine “the Sabbath as a civil institution.” Is it? I repeat that the mere fact that the law requires cessation from labor, etc., upon Sunday, or any other day, does not make it a civil institution. Its observance may have been required from time immemorial by nations, but that fact does not make it a *civil* institution. The definition of the word “civil” is as follows:—

> Civil: Pertaining to a city or State, or to a citizen in his relations to his fellow-citizens, or to the State.

As fellow-citizens, we all recognize the fact that we sustain to the State and to each other, a certain relationship. The functions of the Government pertain to this relationship. They cannot possibly extend beyond it. In the requirement of the Government, and the obligation of the citizen, there should be harmony and justice. For this very purpose “governments are instituted among men.” Let us test the institution of the Sabbath upon this principle.

Suppose the Government requires the observance of a day as “a day of cessation from labor, and of quiet and order.” They claim that it is a *right* of the citizen that it should thus be observed,—a *civil *requirement. Now if this be true, the violation of this institution will be an *uncivil act,* and that relationship that the violator sustained to the State or fellowcitizen, will be broken. He will be accounted as subverting that right guaranteed to the citizen by the Government. Let us see what acts constitute a breach of this institution. Mr. Pancher cites as precedents the action of the English Government that passed statutes “regulating the keeping of the people from any sports and pastimes whatsoever, worldly labor, the opening of a house or room for public entertainment or amusement, the sale of beer, wine, spirits, etc., and other like acts on that day.” He says there were other acts designed to compel attendance at church, etc., which would be prohibited now (?), “but the acts referred to do not relate to religious profession or worship, but to the *civil* obligations and duties of the subject and citizen,” etc.

I have now defined some of those duties, at least, that the citizen owes the State, the violation of which will be a breach of the civil law. Let us examine this a little.

“Keeping the people from any sports or pastimes whatsoever.” There are many things that would come under this head, such as hunting, fishing, ball-playing, driving, walking, etc., etc. Suppose that on a Sunday (or any other day that the Government may set apart), neighbor A takes his fishing tackle to some stream, for pleasure; neighbor B and his wife drive to their country residence; neighbor C and family visit the park, or some other place for recreation. The law forbids any “sports or pastimes whatsoever,” and these parties have violated the laws and are field as criminals. They have violated a *civil* (?) institution. But let us see what these people did. Neighbor A was fishing; neighbor B was driving to the country; neighbor C and family were enjoying nature and the pure air of heaven. Is fishing an uncivil act? Has B broken his relationship to the State or to his fellow-citizen by driving? Has C and family infringed upon the rights of any as they were recreating? It is so held; because for committing these acts they were found guilty—so we would be led to the conclusion, logically, that the *acts* were uncivil. But let us see. On any other day, the observance of which is not required, others can fish all day, drive as much as they please, recreate all they desire. I look, but they are not apprehended. Why? They have committed the very same acts, but the law does not say they are criminals. Why? “Oh,” says one, “these acts were not done on the day set apart.” But if they were *uncivil* acts on a *set day* and infringed upon the right of the State or citizen, why would they not be *uncivil upon another day?* So it will be said of “worldly labor.” That will be forbidden on the day set apart for the Nation, and the man who will presume to till the soil, reap his grain, or do any other work coming under this head will be apprehended and punished. But on any day not so set apart, men can engage in these duties and will not be interfered with. We are led to the just and logical conclusion, that it is not the *act*, but the *day* upon which it is performed that constitutes the offense. So the matter reverts to the *observance* of the day and not the nature of the *acts* performed upon it.

Is the observance of a day a civil requirement? Let us see. Is the Sabbath an institution of the State, or of God?—Of God most assuredly. It antedates earthly governments. The observance of the day being required, is it a civil or a moral obligation?—A moral obligation in the strictest sense. None but God can truly know that we do observe it as we should. In all his requirements, he takes cognizance of the thoughts and desires of the heart, and to be acceptable, our service must be a willing and delightsome one. Neither can we find in its non-observance a breach of that relationship we owe to the State or to our fellow-citizen. To whom do we owe civility? Answer, to the State. To whom do we owe morality? Answer, to God. The Sabbath being a moral institution, and not a civil, to whom do we owe its observance?—To God, most as suredly.

“But” says one, “would you not prohibit the sale of intoxicants and many other things that you have not mentioned, upon that day?” There are a great many things that should be prohibited, but not because they are performed upon that day, but because they are uncivil, and for that reason they should be prohibited every day. Let us first decide whether the act is an uncivil act, and infringes upon the right guaranteed to the citizen, and then let the Government not only prohibit it upon *one* day, but *every* day. Therefore we claim that as the Sabbath day is an institution of God, and not of the State, and as its observance or non-observance does not interfere with that relationship with which governments only have to do, that the Sabbath is not a civil institution. R. D. HOTTEL.
