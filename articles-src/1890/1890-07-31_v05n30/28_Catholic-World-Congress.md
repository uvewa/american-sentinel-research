AT the Catholic Congress held at Baltimore, last year, a committee was appointed to arrange for another one to be held in connection with the World's Fair in 1892. The *Catholic Review* of June 29, urges upon the committee prompt and steady action in preparing for the Congress. It says that "the Congress will be an American Congress, but the celebration must# be continental, and delegates from every diocese in North and South America, representatives from every race on the continent should find recognition on this occasion." We wait now to see what steps the National Reform Association, and the American Sabbath Union will take to secure the recognition of representatives in that Congress.
