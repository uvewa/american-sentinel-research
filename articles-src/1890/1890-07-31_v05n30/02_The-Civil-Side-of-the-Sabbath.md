# The Civil Side of the Sabbath.

IN Eccl. 7:29 we read: “Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.” The above title, quoted from a National Reformer so-called, displays one of the many inventions of those who are clamoring for civil law to compel all to observe an institution wholly religious. They call it the “Christian Sabbath,’’and claim for it divine sanction and religious obligation. If this claim is just, civil law has no more to do for its enforcement, than it has for the enforcement of the Christian ordinances of baptism and the Lord’s supper. It is a matter entirely at the option of each individual. God leaves men free to serve him or not as they choose, retaining the right to call them to judgment in his own time. And our unequaled Constitution forbids the making of any law prohibiting the free exercise of choice in all religious matters. This is as it should be; it is in harmony with the Golden Rule. All have the right to keep Sabbath, if they choose, and when they choose.

But National Reformers wish to compel all to keep Sabbath when they do; and to evade the truth that they wish to enforce a religious institution by civil law, they tax to the uttermost their inventive powers to find a way to make it appear that they do not ask for religious legislation. Hence their Sabbath has many sides; as the sanitary side, the merciful side, the protection side, and the civil side. All this, and I know not how much more, to persuade the good people that legislation in favor of a religious observance is not religious legislation, or the establishing a form of religion by law, the very thing which our peerless Constitution prohibits.

All have the privilege of resting one day in seven, if they think it for their health; but if they do not rest on a particular day, it is not a contagious disease, like the small-pox or yellow fever, that will endanger the lives of those who do rest. Workingmen have the privilege of resting on Sunday, without compelling everybody else to rest on that day. And in regard to protection, our laws justly protect all in religious worship on every day in the whole year. And there is nothing uncivil—nothing which infringes upon the rights of others—in quietly attending to one’s own business on any day. But it would be quite uncivil to compel any man to lose the reward of honest labor on any day on which he chooses to work. The civil side of religious legislation has been sufficiently exemplified in past ages of the world. To repeat the experiment is worse than folly. R. F. COTTRELL.
