THE *Loyal American* found something in THE AMERICAN SENTINEL which it thought was awry, and asked for an explanation. We have given it; now it is our turn. In its issue of July 2, it sets forth among its principles this:—

> We want all wills to be signed thirty days before death, or failing that, the State shall divide the estate among the heirs.

Now we should like the *Loyal American *to explain just how every man is to know when he is within thirty days of his death so that he can make his will, and escape the penalty here proposed? We pause for a reply.
