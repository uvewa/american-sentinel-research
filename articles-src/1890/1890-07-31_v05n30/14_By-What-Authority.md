THE Colorado *Catholic* of June 21, gives editorial expression to a few points which are worthy of consideration by the Sunday Union, and National Reform Association. The *Catholic* says:—

> The ranting and raving of certain ministers of Denver anent Sunday observance is becoming simply disgusting. Last Sunday a certain minister went about from church to church airing himself on the question. What right had he to say to any man that he must deprive himself of any amusement on Sunday? Did Jesus Christ, in whom he professes to believe, appoint Sunday as a day of rest? No, he did not. Why then should these ministers assume to themselves the right to tell any man what he must do on Sunday? . . . Yes. the world concedes that man needs a day of rest. What right have you to say it shall be Sunday? . . . . Sunday is to be observed by religious worship and prayer, not because of any State law. but because God has commanded it. He has commanded it through his church, therefore it is to be observed in the manner indicated by that church. Now, the church which has appointed Sunday as a day of rest—the day Mr. Crafts follows—never demanded the puritanical and nonsensical observance required by him. . . . But we say to you, ministers of Denver, you have no right to demand any religious observance of Sunday unless you find it in your rule of faith—the Bible—which you may search till the day of doom for a single text to sustain your position. Do not resort to civil process for support, for our Constitution guarantees us religious liberty, and you have no right to say to any man that he must be sanctimonious and hypocritically pious instead of light hearted and merry, which the Catholic Church bids all her children to be.

There is nothing uncertain or indefinite about these statements. Do the Sundaylaw advocates acknowledge their truth or deny them? If they deny, upon what authority do they base their denial?
