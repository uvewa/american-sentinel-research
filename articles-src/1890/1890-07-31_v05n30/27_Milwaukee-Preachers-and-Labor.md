THE preachers of Milwaukee, not long since, discussed in their Monday meeting, the subject of "Capital and Labor." The following resolution was introduced:—

> *Resolved,* By this Preachers' Conference, that we are in full sympathy with the laboring people of this city, and stand ready at any and all times to manifest friendly, fraternal regard to each. Our churches are open to every one, and all shall be cordially welcomed when they desire to come.

The resolution was fully discussed, but was mostly objected to on the ground that it seemed to imply that the laboring classes had not before been welcomed to the churches, and the following resolution was substituted:—

> *Resolved,* That this Preachers' Conference is in full sympathy with all the people of this city, rich or poor, learned or unlearned, and stands ready at all times to welcome all to our churches and assist any to lead a better life.

This was unanimously adopted. But that the first resolution should have ever been introduced, or the second one either introduced or adopted, is, in itself, a grave reflection upon the influence of those churches. When professed Christian churches have to advertise that the people are welcome to attend them, and welcome to their assistance to lead a better life, in other words, when they have to advertise that they are Christians, they are in a sorry plight so far as Christianity is concerned. But there is entirely too much of that kind of Christianity in the United States, and that is why there is so much demand that the State shall take charge of religious instruction and religious observances.
