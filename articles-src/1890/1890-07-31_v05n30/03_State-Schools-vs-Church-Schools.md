THE *Loyal American* says that, "THE AMERICAN SENTINEL questions the right of the State to prescribe what language shall be taught in the State schools," and asks us to explain why. The *Loyal American* ought to read THE SENTINEL more carefully. THE SENTINEL never did, and never will, question the right of the State to prescribe what language shall be taught in the State school. All that THE SENTINEL has done in this line is to question the right of the State to prescribe what language or any thing else shall be taught in church schools. For any church to undertake to prescribe what should be taught in State schools, everybody knows would be a union of Church and State; and for any State to undertake to prescribe what shall be taught in any church school is a union of State and Church. And the difference between the evils of a union of State and Church and a union of Church and State is too slight to be defined. Therefore, THE AMERICAN SENTINEL protests just as much against a union of State and Church as anybody else does against a union of Church and State, and we wish the *Loyal American *would do so too.
