# What We May Expect.

THE Washington Baseball Club has been prevented from filling an engagement for a Sunday game at Atlantic Park, Washington, by the Commissioners of the District of Columbia.

District Commissioner Douglass thus states the law and the gospel of the case, as reported in the Washington *Evening Star:—*

“Commissioner Douglass in an interview with a *Star* reporter upon the subject said: ‘I thought it would shock the country to learn that such a thing as Sunday baseball was permitted at the national capital. If we had been unsuccessful in finding a law I should have done my utmost to manufacture one.’”

“You found a law then?” queried the *Star* man. “Yes, we did, the old common law of England held that the Christian religion was part of the common law, and when the first settlers came to this country they brought the common law with them. You know that it’s against the Christian religion to play ball on Sunday, for on the face of it, it’s a violation of the fourth commandment. That is the law we operated upon in this case.”

So the time has already come when the Commissioners, having in charge the administration of the local government of the national capital, search the statute books for an authority, however obscure, to uphold them in enforcing a religious requirement; and openly assert their readiness to manufacture a law to suit if none shall be found.

So far as its applicability is concerned, that is just what they have done,—manufactured a law. Blackstone says, in Book IV, page 58 (Cooley’s Blackstone): “These are offenses punishable at common law by fine and imprisonment, or other infamous corporal punishment; *for Christianity is part of the laws of England.”* Commissioner Douglass is no more endowed with authority to decide what is a “violation of the fourth commandment,” or with power to enforce such a decision, than is the chief executive of this Nation endowed with political perfection, because Blackstone says, in Book I. page 245 (Cooley’s Blackstone), “The law also ascribes to the king, in his political capacity, absolute *perfection.* The king can do no wrong. . . The king, moreover, is not only incapable of *doing* wrong, but even of *thinking* wrong; he can never mean to do an improper thing: in him is no folly or weakness.” One of these political dogmas is just as sound as the other, and if one may be applied as binding now and here, the other may be also, for the same reason.

The Christian religion is a part of the law of the land; the President (and Commissioner Douglass) “can do no wrong, neither think any wrong, in him is no folly or weakness.” This is the perfection which the Commissioner has arrogated to himself in assuming to decide that to play ball on Sunday is a violation of the fourth commandment, and then, as he says, “to operate upon that law.”

The Commissioner decides that when Jehovah wrote, on Sinai, “the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, in it thou shalt not do any work,” etc., he intended to have written, “the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, is the rest day of a Christian nation, in it thou shalt not play baseball,” etc.; and having so determined, the Commissioner by virtue of divine right of authority as the representative of the chief executive, who can do no wrong, constitutes himself the vicegerent of God to enforce his law. This is the common law precedent upon which the Commissioner has seen fit to take summary action as a public official of the capital city of the United States.

It is well to look through that chapter of Blackstone on “Offenses against God and Religion,” from which the Commissioner obtains his “law,” that we may know what to expect in the future. (See Cooley’s Blackstone, Book IV, pp. 41-64.) In this chapter Blackstone enters into the consideration of those offenses “which are more immediately injurious to God and his holy religion.”

> I. Of this species (of offenses) the first is that of *apostasy, *or a total renunciation of Christianity, by embracing either a false religion, or no religion at all. This offense can only take place in such as have once professed the true religion. . . .

> II. A second offense is that of *heresy,* which consists, not in a total denial of Christianity, but of some of its essential doctrines, publicly and obstinately avowed.
> III. Another species of offenses against religion are those which affect the *established church.* And these are either positive or negative: positive, by reviling its ordinances; or negative, by non-conformity to its worship.
> IV. The fourth species of offenses, therefore, more immediately against God and religion, is that of *blasphemy* against the Almighty, by denying his being or providence; or by contumelious reproaches of our Saviour Christ. Whither also may be referred all profane scoffing at the holy Scriptures, or exposing it to contempt and ridicule. These are offenses punishable at common law by fine and imprisonment, or other infamous corporal punishment; for Christianity is part of the laws of England. . . .
> VI. A sixth species of offense against God and religion of which our ancient books are full, is a crime of which one knows not well what account to give. I mean the offense of *witchcraft, conjuration, enchantment, or sorcery. . . .*
> VII. A seventh species of offenders in this class are all *religious impostors;* such as falsely pretend an extraordinary commission from heaven; or terrify and abuse the people with false denunciations of judgments. These, as tending to subvert all religion, by bringing it into ridicule and contempt, are punishable by the temporal courts with fine, imprisonment, and infamous corporal punishment. . . .
> IX. Profanation of the Lord’s day, vulgarly (but improperly) called *Sabbath-breaking,* is a ninth offense against God and religion, punished by the municipal law of England. . . . And therefore the laws of King Athelstan forbade all merchandizing on the Lord’s day, under very severe penalties. And by the statute 27 Henry VI., chap. 5, no fair or market shall be held on the principal festivals, Good Friday, or any Sunday (except the four Sundays in harvest), on pain of forfeiting the goods exposed to sale. And since, by the statute 1 Car. I„ chap 1, no person shall assemble out of their own parishes for any sport whatsoever upon this day; nor in their parishes, shall use any bull or bear-bating, interludes, plays, or other *unlawful* exercise, or pastimes; on pain that every offender shall pay 3s. 4d. to the poor.
These are some of the provisions of Chapter IV. Book IV., Blackstone’s Commentaries, from which the Commissioners of the District of Columbia obtain their law for the ordering of the civil affairs of the capital of this free and enlightened country, just entering upon the last decade of the nineteenth century, and after more than a hundred years of supposed separation of Church and State. W. H. M. [223-224]

THE *Catholic Review* remarks that “the theory that not a dollar should be spent by Government for the spread of religion is a very good theory, but it does not work, never did, and never will.” It is not strange that Roman Catholics should take such a view of this matter, but it is surprising that so many Protestants should agree with them.

JUNE 17, the Sheriff of Rock County served a writ of *mandamus* on the School Board of the city of Edgerton, Wisconsin, commanding it to compel teachers not to read the Bible in the public schools. This is the district from which the famous Bible case came, which was decided by the Supreme Court against allowing the Bible in the public schools. Teachers have thus far ignored the decision.

“I NOTICED a queer thing recently in Philadelphia,” said a New York man the other day. “It was Sunday, and all the street cars ran as usual except that there were no bells on the horses. They told me that was the law there. They have to wear bells week-days, so that people will notice them coming and get out of the way, but Sundays, apparently, it doesn’t make any difference whether folks are run over or not. The proprieties are observed you see, but business isn’t interfered with.”

THE *Union Signal* has grown enthusiastic over Senator Blair, and finds vent in the following piece of sentimental sweetness:—

> Senator Blair is one of the wisest statesmen in Congress; the white-ribbon army, the home-folk, the wage-earners, the militant Christians, are proud of his leadership. Though a recreant Senate voted down his Educational Bill by six majority, his plan of national aid against illiteracy is sure to win. More than any other senator of this generation he represents the hopes of the classes that need a champion. He has dared to take up the gauntlet for them; dared to devote himself to their interests, and we humbly trust they may not only dare but have the power to do, that he may yet be President of the United States. Two pillars must be set up between which the processions of the future shall march into America’s temple of prosperity and peace. They are National Education and National Prohibition. When put in place these pillars of our moral Hercules will bear the name of Henry W. Blair.

We know that the United States Senate is not composed of the highest model of statesmenship, but as for Senator Blair, we know that he is not a statesman at all, in any true sense of the word, where American principles are concerned. The legislation which he has originated, and the speeches which he has made in support of that legislation, show that he does not understand the first principles of the United States Government. It is true that he is the champion of the classes who need that kind of a champion, and it is true that to people who need that kind of a champion, he is the very kind of a champion that they would like; but there are two things about it that are too bad. First, it is too bad that there should be anybody to need such a champion. Secondly, even though there be such, it is too bad that they can find anybody in the United States to be their champion.

THE *Loyal American* plaintively asks: “Shall we permit priests to deprive native born Americans of a birthright, the right to know the language of their native land?” Certainly not; neither shall we suffer them to be deprived of the privilege of learning the language of their fathers if they wish to learn it. The fact is, however, that no priests wish to deprive “native born Americans,” or anybody else, of learning the language of their native land; indeed they are anxious for them to learn it, and to learn every thing else that will enable them to become legislators, etc., and so rule the country. The *Loyal American* need not fear that any considerable number of “native born Americans” will grow up in ignorance of the language and customs of the country.

IN the article on the Bennett Law in THE SENTINEL of June 5, we said:—

> The Lutherans maintain the perfect right of the public school to exist, and willingly pay their proportion of the public-school taxes.

We have received letters from Nebraska and Wisconsin, stating that this is not true in the localities from which these letters come. One of the letters coming from the County Judge of Jefferson County, Nebraska, says that to his knowledge the Lutherans pay the public school taxes unwillingly and only because they must do so. Another comes from a trustworthy citizen of Liberty Bluffs, Wisconsin, in which he says the same thing and gives the following facts:—

> When I settled in this part of Wisconsin, the German Lutherans were not in the majority, and we had eight or nine months school in the year, and fairly good teachers; but just as soon as they got a majority of votes in our district, the time was cut down to five months in the year, all in the winter, no summer term; and teachers wages cut down as low as thirteen dollars to sixteen dollars per month. They voted down all propositions to repair school house, purchase maps, dictionary, etc. Finally when this did not break up the school altogether, they voted to have no school at all, and actually *had no school for over a year;* and if the State Superintendent had not interfered, this state of things might have continued. Many other districts that I know of have this same difficulty, more or less where the German Lutheran element predominates, especially in rural districts.

We made our statements upon the authority of the statements of the synods of the West. The official statements of the Lutheran body must be taken as the principles of the body; and although these facts no doubt exist in the localities named, it is clearly in violation of the principles announced by the body as such in the United States. We are glad to know these facts. We do not indorse the action in the slightest degree, yet from the official statements of the Lutheran body, in our position we cannot hold that body responsible for the action of the Lutherans in these localities. These facts only show that the Lutherans in those localities have gone contrary to their principles; and whether in that place or any other, such action has ever been taken, we earnestly hope that they may reform, and conform to the principles set forth as the principles of the Lutheran body.

We have no sympathy with any antagonism to the public-school system. But, the practice of the Lutherans in the localities named, even though it were more general, will not justify, to the least extent, the State in invading private rights, and taking charge of the private school, and putting itself in the place of the parent, as the Bennett Law does. Clearly the Lutherans named by these correspondents were, and are, in the wrong; and the State of Wisconsin, in the Bennett Law, is also clearly in the wrong; and the wrong course of the Lutherans does not make right the wrong course of the State.

REFERRING to the King case, the details of which are familiar to our readers, the Denison, Texas, *Gazette* says:—

> The case has been taken to the Supreme Court of the United States by the National Religious Liberty Association, a society that admits no person to membership who does not believe in Christianity, but holds that the functions of Church and State are entirely distinct. If the United States Supreme Court does not teach the Tennessee witch-burners a lesson, a majority of the American people will be disappointed. We have had entirely too much of the Sabbath invasion of other men’s homes. It feeds prejudice, embitters enmity, fractures friendship, wrongs individuals, and does no manner of good whatever.

It is certain that this case is bound to attract a great deal of attention. It is being very extensively noticed by the press of the country. [225]
