# Not True as Stated.

THE following extracts from the Congressional Record, of February 19, are suggestive of the methods employed in accumulating signatures to petitions for a national Sunday-rest law:—

> *Mr. Sherman:* I present a petition of citizens of Ohio, collected by the National Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, praying for the passage of a National Sunday-rest law. I notice the printed indorsement on the back of the petition states that it contains 701 individual signatures. This is evidently not true; but I suppose the statement ought to be that it contains the signatures of clergymen or otherwise representing 701 individual persons. It seems to me that the person who made the indorsement, ought not to state it in the way it is, for it is not true, as stated.

> *Mr. Spooner:* I find on my desk, doubtless intended to be presented to the Senate, a petition said to contain 2,000 individual signatures from Wiscon sin, praying for the passage of a Sunday-rest law. In the envelope I find, and I present to the Senate, three printed slips with a printed form of petition, and the following indorsement:—
> Indorsed by Madison Convention of Congregational churches, representing churches of five counties, with membership of 1,400.
> Attest, JAMES M. CAMPBELL, President.
> *Sun Prairie, Wis., June* 10, 1889.
> Which accounts, as I understand it, for the 1,400 individual signatures stated on the envelope.
> Here is another indorsed by a meeting of citizens of Milwaukee, June 9, 1889, number of petitioners, 450; and still a third, indorsed by a mass meeting of citizens in Milwaukee, June 9, 1889, number of petitioners, 150.
When it is understood, that what was said in these individual cases, is just as applicable to millions of ostensible signatures, counted and presented in favor of this movement, then it can be understood how unanswerable an argument against the passage of this bill, is bound up in these same petitions.W. H. M.

HERE is a petition which all are asked really to sign, so that when it is presented in Congress it *will be* “true as stated”:—

> We, the undersigned, adult residents of the United States, twenty-one years of age or more, hereby respectfully but earnestly petition your honorable body not to pass any bill in regard to the observance of the Sabbath or Lord’s Day, or any other religious or ecclesiastical institution or rite; nor to favor in any way the adoption of any resolution for the amendment of the national Constitution that would in any way give preference to the principles of any one religion above another, or that will in any way sanction legislation upon the subject of religion, but that the total separation between religion and the State, assured by our national Constitution as it now is, may forever remain as our fathers established it. [87-88]

OUR thanks are due to Hon. H. W. Baker, Superintendent of the State Documents, Albany. N. Y., for official documents furnished.

Now that the United States Senators begin to say on the floor of the Senate Chamber, that the Sunday-law petitions are “not true as stated,” perhaps those who are running the Sunday-law business will discover that it would be better to be honest and state the truth as it is. See page 86 of this paper.

MARCH 5, there was presented to the Senate of the United States a petition carrying 308,377 names in opposition to the Blair Sunday bill and the Blair resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution respecting establishments of religion and free public schools. This makes more than 658,000 *bona fide* signatures that have been presented to the Senate in opposition to these measures. Let the good work go on.

THE Young People’s Christian Endeavor societies of Poughkeepsie, N. Y., have started a boycott on Sunday trade. They are endeavoring to get people to sign an agreement not to patronize any stores that do not close on Sundays, only excepting drug stores. These societies would do better to spend their efforts in an honest endeavor to be Christians, than to lay themselves out in such “Christian endeavor” as this amounts to.

A GENTLEMAN who holds a proper estimate of human nature has stated to us that, though we are so strongly opposed to the work and aims of those who are seeking to secure religious legislation, we ourselves would be just as bad as they are if we had the power which they are asking for. Of course we would. And for the very good reason that we would have to be as bad as they are before we could ask for that power; and being as bad as they in asking for it we certainly would be as bad as they in the use of the power when obtained. Our constant purpose is, that by the grace of God we may be kept so good, that we will *never ask for any such power.*

WE are indebted to Prof. W. H. McKee Secretary of the National Religious Liberty Association, for a copy of the Brief submitted by him to the Congressional Committee on the proposed District Sunday law. We shall print it next week. Professor McKee is a graduate of Michigan University Law School, and a practical lawyer besides—having been regularly admitted to the bar in three different States—and we can assure our readers that in this Brief there is a treat in store for them.

OUR esteemed Republican contemporary, the *Tribune,* reports that the experiment in State socialism which the State of New York entered upon when it determined to pay the laborers it employs higher wages than the market rate, is to be continued, and that the Legislature will have to appropriate $600,000 to bear the expense of keeping it up during 1890.

It. is a bad experiment. State socialism ought not to be encouraged or tolerated in this country. The State should pay the same wages as are paid by other employers of labor, and no more.—*New York Sun.*

IN the *North American Review,* for March, there is a fine discussion of “The Limitations of the Speakership,” by Speaker Reed and Ex-Speaker Carlisle. The editor of the *Review* graciously informs the public that “of all *others”* these two gentlemen could discuss this question “with adequacy in point of practical experience and contrasted principles.” “Others” indeed! We had supposed that of all men in the country these two gentlemen were *themselves.* And if Mr. Bryce had only been in the gallery of the House of Representatives, January 29 last, we believe that he would be inclined to think so too. Assuredly, Mr. Editor, these two gentlemen are *themselves,* not “others.”

THE organ of the French Evangelical Publishing Society, *Semeur* (Springfield Mass.), the publication of which was suspended last fall, has again made its appearance under a new name. It is now known as *Le Citoyen Franco-American, *which means “The Franco-American Citizen.” It is printed principally in French but has an English department, and has a thoroughly Protestant ring which is decidedly refreshing. The object of the paper is the promulgation of Protestantism among French-speaking people in America, and while its publishers do not wish their countrymen to forget that they are French, they do desire that they shall become thoroughly loyal American citizens, owing allegiance, not to the Pope of Rome but to the Government under which they live, and to the God who gives them their being. We trust that *Le Citoyen Franco-American* will be always and in every part thoroughly and consistently Protestant.

REFERRING to the Blair bills, a Nebraska paper (the *Bertrand Herald)* says:—

> It is lucky for the country that Senator Blair does not possess the power to formulate a national bill of fare for every American citizen. It is fortunate for both Church and State that he has not the power to direct just what shall be taught in our public schools and just how each individual shall regard Sunday, whether he be Christian, infidel, agnostic or Jew, If Senator Blair could secure the position of chief dictator to this nation, the American people would soon find themselves shorn of every individual right. Religious liberty and freedom of conscience would be destroyed, and Church and State would be as firmly united as in the days of the rack and the Inquisition.

THE temperance crusades of the women are changing color as the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union have more to do with politics. When they first began, through the power of prayer to God and persuasion to men, saloons were closed, men were converted, and whisky was poured into the gutter. But in Lathrop, Missouri, lately, the women entered on another kind of crusade. They did not pray or weep, but became indignant, smashed the doors of two law-breaking saloonists, poured whisky and brandy into the gutter and set it on fire. Something like $1,000 worth was destroyed. The change illustrates the changing spirit of the age. We believe, however, that the praying crusade was the better one.—*Signs of the Times.*

THE Archbishop of Canterbury has taken out a license to sell beer and wine for the entertainment of the clergy of his diocese. An English bishop said in a public address not long ago that one of his ambitions was to keep a public house. His Grace of Canterbury will now have an opportunity to show his talents as the keeper of a “pub.,” and doubtless his stock of refreshments will be pure.—*New York Sun. *[89]
