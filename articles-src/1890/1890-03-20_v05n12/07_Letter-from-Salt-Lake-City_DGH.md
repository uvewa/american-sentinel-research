EDITORS AMERICAN SENTINEL: There is such a general interest in the recent "Liberal" or "Gentile" victory in this city, that it may not be out of place to address a few words to your valuable paper on that subject. The writer had the privilege of seeing the entire campaign and attending the ward meetings, grand rallies, and parades of both parties, and he faithfully improved the opportunity.

In this campaign, so long and fiercely contested, all old party lines were laid aside and the two factions assumed the names of the "People's Party." and the "Liberals." The former embraced the *faithful* of the Mormon Church, irrespective of race, education, or previous political persuasion. The latter embraced *all dissenting* classes. The wealthy merchant and the poor boot- black trudged side by side through the mud and rain; the Democrat and the Republican helped to bear the "Liberal" banner; the native-born but apostate soil of Utah, and the adventurer, had but one emblem—the carpet-bag. The East, the West, the North, the South, all aided in the fight and rejoiced in the victory. The naturalized citizens seemed to be moved by the same spirit, and as the vast procession passed one would often see the German carrying a torch, and the Scandinavian bearing the motto.

The political speakers were characteristic of the two parties. The "People's Party" meetings were addressed by the "apostles," "prophets," and "elders," only they were always introduced as *Mr. *These meeting were not *religious;* they were *civil* and *political,* but it was often hard to see the distinction between "Apostle" A's sermon in the Tabernacle on Sunday, and "Mr." A's political speech on Monday. Yet, like the National Reform Sunday, you must *call* it civil because that is its name. The "Liberal" speakers, on the other hand, were from all classes except the "Saints." To say that they were *all* good men and actuated by noble motives is to affirm more than could be expected.

The tickets presented by the parties will bear the closest study. While the "Liberal" ticket, like the party, was of all classes, good, bad, and indifferent, irrespective of race, nativity, or religious belief, the "People's" ticket contained only the names of those who were members of the "Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints." True, the tickets were formed in open convention by delegates from the various precincts. Yet the careful observer noted the fact that although no one pretended to know who would be nominated by the "Liberals," a daily paper published the "People's" ticket *twenty-four hours before the caucus convened.* It was no mere guess-work. Every man was named for his respective office, and when the delegates assembled to form the tickets the nominations were tendered to the very men named. One gentleman, however, declined and another name was put in his place.

It is not just to say that these delegates intentionally betrayed their sacred trust. The fault is in the *system.* These men, many of them of unquestioned integrity, believed, with the National Reformers, that "the kingdom of Christ must enter the realm of law through the gate-way of politics," and they embraced the opportunity of carrying their belief into practice. The result is, they have a theocracy with an infallible (?) man at its head, and the Church dictates every political move even while she denies any connection with the State. [92]

The "Liberal" victory means a Government of the people, by the people, for the people. In many respects the Mormon rule was good. It is safe to say that the officials were as honest as the average politician; yet their administration can never be called republican government. The Church ruled the State, and her favorites and interests received the first attention.

There were loud cries of fraud on both sides, but the election passed off very quietly and every candid man must admit that the victory was honestly won. Undoubtedly there were unscrupulous men in both parties and on both tickets, but there were also men whom even their political enemies acknowledge as worthy of the highest trust and confidence. It is very probable that this defeat of the Mormon hierarchy will be lasting. The effort was not to overthrow the religion but to break the union of Church and State which was enslaving minds and blighting the Government. Let us not censure the men who have been educated to believe they are doing God service in following the dictates of an ambitious and unscrupulous priesthood. Let us pity their condition; condemn their religio-political system, and try to avoid repeating their mistakes.D. G. HENRY
