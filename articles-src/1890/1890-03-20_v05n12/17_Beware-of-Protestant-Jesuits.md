THE friends of liberty must not for one moment forget that the advocates of National Sunday legislation are working night and day to secure the enactment of the Blair Sunday-rest bill. This bill is really in the interest of the Church and of the Church only, but the crafty schemers engineering it have done all they could to deceive the people into the belief that its object is "to secure to the people the privileges of rest and of religious worship" on Sunday, "free from disturbance by others," just as though existing laws did not guarantee this freedom from disturbance on all days of the week! Beware of the Protestant Jesuits!—*Fair Play. *[95-96]
