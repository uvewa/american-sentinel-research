WHILE the Blair Sunday-observance bill now before Congress is drawing the attention of church people that way, the Legislature of South Dakota is kicking up a rumpus with the prohibition bill it is considering. The objectionable feature of the latter bill is that it prohibits the use of fermented wine for sacramental purposes. The writer is one of a large class that believes that the Bible does not require that fermented wine be used at the communion table. We understand, however, that the rules of the Catholic Church require fermented wine, and the clergymen of the Episcopal Church are divided on the subject. This being the case, it seems as though the bill if passed, would be declared unconstitutional, on the ground that it interfered "with the religious rights and privileges of the Church and individual." These words were taken from an interview of Bishop M. N. Gilbert, of the Episcopal Church, a pronounced temperance man. It seems to us that the Dakota prohibitionists are carrying things too far. Every temperance man, with the exception of extremists, is satisfied to confine his opposition to the liquor business to the *abuse* of liquor, and does not care to interfere with its *legitimate use.* So long as the use of fermented wine for sacramental purposes is at least an open question, it does not seem like quite the proper thing to decide with such positiveness. When the abuses of liquor are among the things of the past, it will be time enough to so regulate its use.— *Litchfield, Minnesota, Review.*
