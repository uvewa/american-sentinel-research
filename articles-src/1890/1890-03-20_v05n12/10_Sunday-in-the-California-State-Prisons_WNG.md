THERE is considerable discussion in California on the question of Sunday work in the State prisons, especially of the running of the jute mills at San Quentin. There is, indeed, opposition to operating these mills at all, as they enter into strong competition with private enterprises of the same nature. But the fact that they are worked seven days in the week, while their competitors work but six, is an additional cause of complaint. It is not my purpose to discuss the merits of the question as to the propriety of the State working its prisoners in competition with its law-abiding citizens; but the assumed religious phase of the subject having been mooted, it comes legitimately within the SENTINEL'S purview.

I have never known anyone, speaker or writer, who undertook to sustain the theory of the State's duty to support Sunday, who did not stultify his argument before he got through. And there was no exception to the rule when, on Sunday evening, March 2; Rev. Dr. Horton, of this city, undertook to condemn the State's jute mill policy from a religious standpoint. Here is one specimen extract from the "prelude:"—

> Punishment is intended to make better men and women of the convicts. Now in order to reform a man two things are necessary. He must first be inspired with a sense of manliness. He must then be encouraged to cultivate a good conscience. But how can men be inspired with manliness when we treat them like whipped slaves, and drive them to toil upon seven days in each week? How can we develop conscience in these men when the great majority of them believe with the vast majority of the general public, and believe rightly, that the enforcement of work on the Sabbath-day is an open defiance of the God of conscience, as well as of all humanitarian and physiological teachings?

This is one of the Doctor's characteristic extravaganzas. It is entirely aside from the real issue between the State's jute mill and those of private enterprise. It is on a par with his utterance in 1885, when preaching on the Sunday question, that "the workingmen of California are in a State of worse slavery than ever existed in the Southern States." Mark, it is not the character of the work, or the fact that they have to. work, or the competition with other institutions, that is drawn into the odious comparison; but it is the seven days' work, that is, the Sunday work, that makes their labor like that of "whipped slaves."

But the alleged general belief in the Sunday institution, not only of the prisoners but of the public, is indeed astonishing. Such exaggeration sounds strangely odd coming from the pulpit. That a majority of these prisoners were averse to work on *any day,* before they got into prision, and are so yet, is probably true; but that their opposition to labor on Sunday arises from a belief that it is an "open defiance of the God of conscience," is too absurd for utterance before intelligent people. And as to the majority of the general public believing that work on Sunday is "open defiance of the God of conscience," every one knows that nothing like a majority have any conscience in the matter at all.

The last question quoted above implies an impossibility of developing conscience in men who believe that Sunday work is open defiance of the God of conscience. This is a pretty hard thrust at the Doctor's co-believers, but it is one of the characteristic muddles in which Sunday-law preachers invariably become entangled. As he perhaps unwittingly assumes that obtuse condition for himself and them, he must not call other folks hard names if they concede the proposition.

Another extract contains a like piece of logic:—

> In order to reform a man you must get him off one side alone, and give him time to think. In order to get such collected thought, men's hands should rest, the ordinary course of activity should be interrupted. This is the very heart of God's ordinance for us all, and this, in the form of solitary confinement one day out of seven, broken only by attendance upon the chaplain, and by meals, is the most hopeful part of prison discipline. Many a man had rather take his chances in a tiger's cage than be left alone for a whole day with himself.

Here is a wonderful idea of improvement in the poor prisoner's condition. It is an awful thing to make him do ordinary work on Sunday,—it is "treating him like a whipped slave." But alas! the terrible alternative, "solitary confinement," to "give him a chance to think." And this, "the most hopeful part of the prison discipline," is acknowledged to be worse to many of them than being placed in a "tiger's cage." This is prison reformation with a vengeance! If that would not "inspire a man with a sense of manliness," his case must indeed be hopeless. And this is not the worst of it. If this Sunday proposition only affected the State prison convicts, those outside might rest comparatively easy. But, says the Doctor, "this is the very heart of God's ordinance of the Sabbath *for us all."*

It seems to me that I have before read somewhere of persons in past centuries who were placed in solitary confinement, shut off from every one but the chaplain; and it was said to be for the purpose of "encouraging them to cultivate a good conscience" toward certain church dogmas. And there is no doubt that many of them would rather have taken their chances in a tiger's cage.

The preacher made a slight reference to "another side of this question,"—to the "outrage on free labor that convicts should be employed in the San Quentin jute mill any day of the week;" but his main lament was in behalf of Sunday. That was the beginning and the end of the prelude. Here is another piece:—

> When shall we cease standing out against the wisdom, piety, and experience of the entire sisterhood of States and enact suitable Sabbath laws, giving every man emancipation from toil one day [94] in seven, making him a free man one-seventh of his time, as much his own master as is the millionaire upon that day. He may wisely choose to go to church thereon, or he may prefer to go to the groves, or to the sea, or into some quiet nook for reading and meditation; he is a free agent and may do as he chooses with his time, always knowing that having chosen his way, he must meet its outcome at the end.

This mild admission that every man ' ' is a free agent and may do as he chooses with his time," does not accord very well with the general appeals for Sunday laws, which nearly all advocates, including the Doctor himself, base upon the custom of men doing as they please on Sunday. That is just what Sunday laws are designed to prevent,—in fact it is their prime object. But there are times in the discussion of the question when it is expedient to put a mild phase on this ideal reform. It will not do to keep the "solitary confinement" idea too exclusively in view. W.
