WE here present to our readers the matter contained in the Brief upon the subject of the District of Columbia Sunday Bill, submitted by Prof. W. H. McKee, secretary of the National Religious Liberty Association, Washington, D. C., to the Congressional Committee at a hearing February 19, 1890. It is worthy of careful study; and it will bear the most critical scrutiny.

> *To the Honorable Committee on the District of Columbia:—*

> GENTLEMEN: In submitting to you this Brief, as a statement of some of the considerations why you are asked to report unfavorably upon House Bill 3854, entitled, "A bill to prevent persons from being forced to labor on Sunday," your attention is called to these propositions:—
> 1. The legislation asked, is unconstitutional, and contrary to the spirit of American institutions.
> 2. Waiving the question of unconstitutionality, Sunday laws already exist in force and enforceable, in the District of Columbia, and the measure is one of cumulative legislation.
> Article First, of the amendments to the Constitution, declares that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion."
House Bill 3854 embodies a measure which Congress is asked to adopt, as a law governing the District of Columbia, over which Congress has sole jurisdiction. Therefore, if this measure has in view the establishment of the observance of a religious dogma, or the enforcement of religious reverence for a particular day, because of the supposed divine origin of the observance required, or because a larger or smaller proportion of citizens observe the day religiously, it is a religious measure, outside the pale of civil legislation, and Congress is incompetent to entertain it.

Three points of internal evidence prove the bill to be religious in its inception, and in its intent.

First, the word "secular," in the phrase "to perform any secular labor or business," betrays the reverential spirit in which the bill is framed. The incongruity of the word, in such a connection, in a purely civil statute, will be perfectly patent, if applied to a supposed measure "to prevent persons from being forced to labor on the 4th of July," or "to prevent persons from being forced to labor on the 22d of February." The various antonyms—regular, religious, monastic, spiritual, clerical—of the word "secular," show the character which this term gives to the bill, and unavoidably. No stronger circumstantial evidence could possibly be required than the unconscious testimony of this expression.

Second: The words "except works of necessity or mercy," are subject, in a lesser degree, to the same construction. The character of phrases, as well as of human beings, may be determined by the company they keep, and this phrase is one which carries the mind immediately to the consideration of religious and Biblical exceptions, made to the strict application of the divine law for the Sabbath. That is the source of the expression, and its course may be followed through all the religious laws for "Sabbath observance," and the judicial interpretation of them, which have been had. The effect of this phrase, in connection with the preceding word "secular," is cumulative.

Third: The exemption clause contains the language, "Who conscientiously believe in and observe any other day." What has a purely civil statute to do with the conscience of man, as regards his conscientious belief in, and observance of, a day of rest? The moment the domain of conscience is touched, as such, from that instant the measure is no longer civil. And if, as this exemption shows, there be a class to whose conscience this bill would work a hardship, and to whose religious convictions it would stand opposed, then *per contra,* there is another class, the consciences of whom the measure is intended to favor. It is, therefore, not only legislation on matters of conscience, but class-legislation as well.

More than this: What does an exemption clause presuppose? Is it not a civil or legal incapacity to meet the requirements of the law? If the incapacity arise within the domain of conscience, it is without the civil sphere, and the necessary conclusion is, that the legislation is outside the jurisdiction of human law.

These three points might be elaborated further, but this statement of them is sufficient to show that the bill bears within itself conclusive evidence of its religious character, and, if religious, it is not within the purview of Congressional legislation, as contemplated by the Constitution.

In measures, as in men, there is an ancestral spirit by which we may know them. What is the heredity of this bill?— Its progenitor in the Senate, is the Blair Sunday-rest bill, which, on its first introduction in the Senate of the Fiftieth Congress, was plainly entitled, "A bill to secure to the people the enjoyment of the first day of the week, commonly known as *the Lord's day,* as a day of rest, and to *promote its observance as a day of religious worship;"* and in the Fifty-first Congress, it is called, "A bill to secure to the people *the privileges* of rest and of *religious worship,* free from disturbance by others, on the first day of the week." The body of the two bills is the same, except that the incongruous nomenclature in the first has been harmonized in the second, and "First day," "Lord's day," and "Sabbath," made to read, "First day" and "Sunday." Although in the last section of the former bill, the expression "religious observance of the Sabbath day" is omitted, in the second, a neutrality clause, for it is nothing else, is inserted which declares, that "this act shall not be construed to prohibit or sanction labor on Sunday, by individuals who *conscientiously* believe in and keep any other day, as *the* Sabbath," etc. It is the same bill resurrected, and attempts the mingling of incongruous elements, which cannot be assimilated—the Sabbath which is Divine, and the Sunday which is human; Sabbath of the moral law, Sunday of the civil law; Sabbath of the Lord thy God, Sunday a religious day by the enactment of Constantine, and a *dies non,* in the statutory nomenclature of the civil law.

The very next branch of this family tree is entitled, "An act to punish blasphemers, swearers, drunkards and Sabbath-breakers," which is openly a religious law. See laws of the District of Columbia, 1868, pp. 136-7-8. The family likeness of these three measures, the old Maryland law, adopted into the statutes of the District, the Blair Sunday-rest bill, and the Breckinridge local Sunday bill, is unmistakable, and, if the original from which the latter two are derived, is a religious law, the two descendants certainly must be.

But, in the bill before this committee, there has been an attempt to separate the civil from the religious, and the claim is made that this measure is consistently for a "civil Sunday." In making good this claim, [93] what is it necessary to show?—It is necessary to show that the legislative and public mind has been entirely divested of the popular idea that Sunday is a day to which a due religious observance is to be paid. Both those who make the law, and those who are subject to it, must be shown to have placed themselves exactly in the mental position of the civilian whose mind has never harbored the thought of the sacredness of one day above another. Then, no other legislative restrictions would be attempted to be placed upon Sunday, than could be enacted for Monday or Tuesday, or any succeeding day of the week. But, read this bill, 3854, and insert for the word Sunday the name of a different day of the week, and consider how quickly the sense of the people would reject it. Its propriety as a civil measure, would be instantly denied. What should give it a different complexion when it contains the word Sunday? What is the magic "presto change" in that name?—It is the religious association; the fact that the consciences of many men for many generations have been trained to reverence Sunday as the holy day of God.

Sunday was first a holiday, dedicated as such to the sun and its worship. So that, in its inception, it was a day, the observance of which was based upon a religious idea; in the accommodation of the forms and observances of the pagan and Christian churches which, for the sake of temporal power and success, was brought about in the reign of Constantine, the Church found it politic, from the point of view which then prevailed, to adopt the pagan holiday and did so, consecrating it anew, with all the sacredness of the religious forms and beliefs of the Church, transferring to it the awful sanctity involved in the commandment of God, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy," and adding to that all the holy sentiment which can be invoked for a day commemorative of the resurrection of our Saviour.

Thus cumulatively religious is the history of this day. The religious idea has never been separated from it. No enforcement of its observance, distinctively from other days, can be divorced from that inbred religious idea, any more than the physical and moral characteristics of the father and mother can be eliminated from the child. This child of the Church and a religious holiday ("the Venerable Day of the Sun") is, by birth, by inheritance, and by unbroken habit throughout its existence, a religious day,—nothing else.
