# The Nation has no Creed.

THE argument still made, occasionally, is; that this is a Christian country and as a Christian country, whose Christianity is founded on the Bible, it is right and proper to read the Bible in the public schools.

I deny the validity of that argument. As individuals the vast majority of us may be theologically Christian, but as a nation we are not Christian; we are nothing theologically. The nation has no creed. It distinctly professes that it has none. It agrees to protect all creeds. It is just as much bound to protect the Mohammedan as the Christian, the atheist as the Methodist. It can only protect all by insisting upon the silence of all through every department of its work.

There are cases in which the majority have no right to rule. Your State or your city, because the majority happens to be Protestant and Evangelical, has, therefore, no right to force Bible reading into the public school, if there be one single Jew, one single atheist, one single Catholic who objects to it.

The Bible is not in the curriculum; it is not studied as history or literature; it is read as religious authority, and its reading is made a religious exercise. If the parent of one single child in all the State objects, then your Bible reading in the public school, becomes a tyranny.

Theology should be absolutely debarred. If a Catholic deems the Bible a Protestant book, if any Unitarian deems it an orthodox book, if any materialist deems it a superstitious book, he has the right to demand that his religious or anti-religious rights shall not be infringed upon. The Jew, who accepts the Old Testament as divine writing, but rejects the New, has a right to demand that his children shall not be compelled to listen to the reading of the New Testament as scripture. The atheist has the same right to demand that his child shall not be submitted in the public schools to a style of teaching which at home is denied.

Suppose it came to pass that the great majority in this city or State were atheists or materialists; what would we call it if they forced into the public school the daily reading of a book which distinctly taught atheism and materialism? Would not Baptists and Presbyterians cry out against the awful tyranny?

It is not in the slightest degree a question of who is right and who is wrong in this matter. Under our form of government a man has the same liberty to believe an error that he has to believe a truth. The Government dare not become censor or pronounce judgment upon any form of theological belief or disbelief. It has no right to allow the public school to become the vehicle of any religious or anti-religious doctrine.

I say, therefore, that if there be one single objector, it is tyranny to keep the Bible in the public school. You say it is read without comment. It is read, and it carries its essential doctrines without the need of comment. Would you allow the Koran to be read as a religious exercise without comment?

The time has come when, if we are true Americans, we must not only allow religious liberty to all sects, we must *demand* religious liberty for all sects. We have passed the limit of simple tolerance. We must secure to the least and poorest his equality and fraternity.

The people of this nation may be overwhelmingly Protestant. Of course I can only rejoice, as an individual, in that fact; but the Nation is not Protestant, the State is not Protestant, the city or town is not Protestant. Every form of our Government must be absolutely noncommittal, without favor or prejudice in this matter.—*Rev. Dr. Crowe, Jersey City.*

SENATOR BLAIR has since the present session of Congress opened, re-introduced his famous Sunday-rest bill. He has changed the title and made other modifications in the bill to disarm opposition. One of the most important is a sop thrown to the Seventh-day Adventists in a proviso exempting them from the operations of the bill. Notwithstanding these disguises and concessions the spirit of the bill remains the same. The principle is wholly radically and fundamentally wrong, and it matters little how the act is doctored and tinkered to satisfy this or that element of opposition. We hope Congress will sit squarely down on it. It matters not what pleas are urged in favor of the bill—that it is the interest of the laboring man to secure to him a day of rest, etc. There may be some truth in this, but the fact still remains that the real object of the bill is coercion of those who differ from the prevailing religious observance of this nation.— *Litchfield Minnesota, Independent.*
