W. C. WALSTON, of Vermont, writes, in the *Review and Herald: *"My work consists in circulating the petition, circulating subscriptions for the AMERICAN SENTINEL, selling Civil Government and Religion, and the National Sunday Law, and circulating other literature in opposition to religious legislation. I have a variety of experiences, as I meet persons of different minds and views; but it is most astonishing how few there are, who are informed in regard to the Blair bills. * * *

"The first field I canvassed was my old home town. I took nearly every leading person's subscription for the SENTINEL, and sold several copies of Civil Government and Religion. I have sold this pamphlet to every clergyman I have visited, with one exception, and to nearly every lawyer. I first visited a man of large influence, who said his attention had not been called particularly to the Blair bills, and he should want to consider the matter fully, before making any move. I left him Civil Government and Religion, and the National Sunday Law to read, and again visited him. He received me cordially, and stated that he had read them with interest and profit. He said he was himself opposed to all forms of State religion, and should be strongly opposed to the Blair bills. He also said he corresponded with one of our State Senators, and would write him his views in regard to the bills in full.

"I realize that this is an important work, and it needs much wisdom and the help of God, to conduct it aright."

Such an expression of their experience, and the result of their work, as this, is desired by the Secretary of the Association, from the workers throughout the field generally.
