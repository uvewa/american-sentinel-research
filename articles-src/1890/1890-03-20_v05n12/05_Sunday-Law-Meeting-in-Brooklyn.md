# Sunday-Law Meeting in Brooklyn.

SUNDAY evening, March 2, there was a meeting held in the Washington Avenue Baptist Church, Brooklyn, N. Y., in the interest of the Kings County Sunday Association. After the opening exercises, which were conducted by the pastor—Rev. Dr. Braislin—Col. A. S. Bacon, vice-president of the association, took the chair and presided throughout the meeting. The chief speaker of the occasion was Rev. Dr. T. A. Fernly, corresponding secretary of the Philadelphia Sabbath Association.

After a chant by the choir the pastor read the second chapter of Colossians, putting special emphasis on the sixteenth and seventeenth verses, which I was at a loss to understand at the time; subsequently, however, it was plain enough; for in the course of the meeting it transpired that while the Doctor is in favor of Sunday keeping, and of Sunday laws too, for that matter, he is much more liberal in his views than Dr. Fernly; and this scripture was evidently designed to fortify his people against some of the views to be presented by the representative of the Philadelphia Sabbath Association. But just how this was will appear in its proper place.

In stating the object of the meeting the chairman dwelt long and ably, and indeed almost entirely, upon the so-called “civil Sabbath;” and it was evidently his wish, if not his expectation, that in his remarks which were to follow, Dr. Fernly would confine himself for the most part to the “civil” phase of the question. But the gentleman from the city of brotherly love proved to be too much of a National Reformer to take the course so gently suggested for him to follow, and dwelt almost entirely upon the religious side of the [85] question. He based the movement squarely upon the binding obligation of the fourth commandment which he maintains has never been repealed. Though what that fact has to do with the Sunday institution or with civil law he did not so much as attempt to show.

The Doctor likened “the American Sunday” to the dykes of Holland, and said that there were leaks which must be stopped or the country would be ruined. One of these leaks is the foreign element which is coming into the country so rapidly. He said if they come and conform to our laws and our religion they are welcome, but if they reject our faith we must do just as any citizen would do should a stranger come to his house and refuse to conform to the rules of the house. Such an one would, he said, be told to go; and if he refused to do so would be put out by physical forcer He thought that in such a case a little “muscular Christianity” would not be out of place. In this respect at least the Doctor’s idea of Christianity differs materially from that of the great Founder of Christianity, and is substantially the National Reform doctrine that infidels should be disfranchised or else banished to some wild desolate land, there for the sake of the devil, and in the name of the devil to set up a Government of their own.

After Dr. Fernly had concluded his speech the chairman called upon the pastor of the church for some remarks, which were made very briefly, but right to the point, though not the point desired by the corresponding secretary of the Philadelphia Sabbath Association unless his looks belied his feelings in the matter.

Dr. Braislin said that he would like to have some definition of what was meant by “Sabbath observance.” He thought that before asking very much of others, Christians should themselves be agreed as to what constituted proper Sunday observance. He utterly repudiated the idea that the keeping of Sunday is enjoined by the fourth commandment, because, said he, “we do not keep the seventh day, but the first.” Nobody, he thought, who rides in his own carriage on Sunday, should object to the running of street cars on that day; and the rich should not be allowed to enjoy privileges on Sunday which the law denies to the poor.

It was very evident that though the Doctor favored some Sunday regulation he was not prepared to go to the lengths advocated by the principal speaker of the evening, and we doubt if the brother from Philadelphia was much comforted by the remark made by the Brooklyn pastor that he would not prolong the meeting, as he was sure of most of the audience at another time. All things considered, the meeting was not what an ardent National Reformer and Sunday-law advocate would be likely to regard as a brilliant success. C. P. BOLLMAN.
