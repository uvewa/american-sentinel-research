# The Blair Legislation.

*To the Editor of the Courant:*—Perhaps. I had better state at the outset, that although my business interests are largely centered in Connecticut, my place of residence is in New Hampshire and I am now a member of the Legislature of that State. As the Hon. Senator, Mr. Blair, of New Hampshire, seems to be doing all in his power in national legislation to pull down the bulwark of religious liberty in this country, I cannot refrain from calling the attention of the citizens of the State of “steady habits” to some of the more salient facts in the case. Mr. Blair’s Sunday-rest-day bill and also his Educational Amendment, are both of a religious nature, making necessary a resolution to amend and eliminate from the national Constitution, the first amendment, which reads:—

> Congress shall make no laws respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.

For more than a hundred years our Constitution has been sufficient, and it has made us a free, in fact the only free Government that has ever graced the pages of history. It is the pure metal whose clear ring has sounded the note of freedom and religious liberty to the oppressed of all nations. It is the heritage of a noble ancestry of good and tried men, themselves fresh from the fires of religious persecution. Let it remain. If we have the illiterate to educate let it be done within the Constitution.

I have personally consulted hundreds of all classes of our people and have yet to find one intelligent citizen willing to sacrifice the clause referred to. The nature of these bills seems to be little understood by the masses. They are so subtle and hidden in their purposes, changing the fundamental principle of our institutions, that it seems like treason. The Constitution stands to-day against the union of Church and State, and Congress cannot legislate in regard to our religious belief.

Our duty to God is not at the behest of Government. Let the following, introduced by Mr. Blair, “Congress shall establish a system of free public schools to teach the non-sectarian principles of Christianity,” become a law, and we have a new sect whose wisdom shall decide what these principles must be. The Government would then become a religious machine, wholly in the power of the ignorant [83] and illiterate voter. Do the people of Connecticut want their public schools under such control?

I am aware of the fact that many good citizens have, at the solicitation of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union and in the interest of temperance, signed memorials to Congress, praying for the advancement of Mr. Blair’s pet measure. I would not impute dishonest motives to the women of America, who, at great sacrifice and heroism, have attacked the most gigantic evil of our times; but must protest against their noble impulses being put to so base a purpose as that of robbing a nation of its right of conscience and religious liberty. It is evidently not the intention of the good women of this country to bring about so deplorable a result. The latter scheme must have originated in the fertile brain of some demagogic political wire puller.—*D. M. S., in Hartford, Connecticut, Courant.*
