> THE observance of Sunday should be a question of conscience and not of law. There is one thing the American citizen feels especial pride in, and that is the religious freedom vouchsafed to us in the Constitution. Let us keep this intact and not entrust our representatives of State or Nation with questions concerning our spiritual welfare, but leave that matter to ourselves and our God.—*Colorado Graphic. *[91]
