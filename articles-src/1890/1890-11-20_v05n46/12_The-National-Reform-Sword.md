# The National Reform Sword.

THE Washington *Star,* of October 20, contains a “special” from Baltimore, dated Sunday the 19th, which says:—

> A great crowd of the best German citizens are tonight excited and very indignant over the action of the police in stopping the lecture which was to have been given at Germania Mannerchor Hall, by Arthur Koebner, of New York. For some reason an old law was resurrected yesterday, and to-night the authorities stated that no entertainment of any sort for which an admission was demanded could take place in Baltimore on Sunday if any one objected thereto. The crowd denounced the decision and the authorities. The statute has been practically dead so long that even the District Attorney knew not of its existence until yesterday.

In a late utterance, Wilbur F. Crafts, speaking in reference to Sunday closing of the Exposition at Chicago, warned those who are opposing religious legislation not to say, that “law is useless because unused. The sword is there ready whenever Chicago’s citizens reach out the hand to wield it.”

Mr. Crafts is right, the sword of religious law, rusty and stained with the blood of over fifty millions of Christian martyrs, is lying sheathed in the statutory crypts of almost every code of laws in the United States. The sword awaits ‘ ‘ the hand to wield it.” What can be more evident than the purpose of the National Reform party, and the American Sabbath Union, to find hands willing to wield this unused sword.

In the same connection it is also said that to open the coming Exposition on Sunday would be to break “the common law of the whole country.” This is an echo of the utterance of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia, that, as Blackstone declares “Christianity to be part of the laws of England,” therefore, it is a part of the laws of the United States, and to be enforced as such.

If we are to accept this as a truth, we must define the scope of the common law on this subject by Blackstone’s words, “Such crimes and misdemeanors as more immediately offend Almighty God, by openly transgressing the precepts of religion either natural or revealed.” Under this, apostasy, renunciation of Christianity, or perversion to Judaism, paganism, or other false religion, is punishable with three year’s imprisonment, and deprivation of the right to bring any action as guardian, executor, legatee, or purchaser of lands.

The offense of heresy at common law consists of a public denial of some of the essential doctrines of Christianity, and although just what heresy definitely is seems always to have been more or less uncertain, nevertheless we have by the statutes 9 and 10, Wm. II. c. 32., the same penalty as for apostasy pronounced upon those who, educated in or professing the Christian religion, shall “deny any one of the persons in the Holy Trinity to be God or maintain that there are more gods than one.”

Blasphemy or profanity, “denying the existence of God or scoffing at the Scriptures . . . are offenses punishable at common law by fine and imprisonment or other infamous corporal punishment.”

Witchcraft, and the telling of fortunes, “is still deservedly punished with a year’s imprisonment and standing four times in the pillory.”

“Profanation of the Lord’s day, vulgarly (but improperly), called Sabbath breaking,” is a finable offense by the statutes 27 Hen. VI. c. 5., and 29 Car. II. c. 7.

All religious impostors, also, who claim a “commission from heaven or terrify and abuse the people with false denunciations of judgments,” may be subjected in the civil courts to fine and imprisonment.

The authority of these ancient English laws was invoked to stop a Sunday game of baseball in the District of Columbia. In Pennsylvania, a forgotten statute of 1794 has been used to close barber shops on Sunday, and now in Baltimore, a law of the existence of which even the prosecuting attorney was in ignorance, so antiquated was it, has been resurrected to prevent a Sunday evening lecture.

It is true, the sword of the Sabbath Union is hidden in every pile of law books.W. H. M. [351-352]

THE *Spokane Falls Review,* in speaking of W. F. Crafts and his lecture, says, “The best way to answer such sophists is to let them alone. Notoriety is what such men court.”

THE Seattle Secularists have sent a remonstrance to the mayor against a proposed ordinance fining barbers for Sunday work. Such a law, they hold, would “relegate honest work to the realm of crime.” And that is just what all Sunday laws do; they make to be a crime on one day that which is commendable upon all other days.

WE publish this week the sermon of Rev. Mr. Utter, of Chicago, on “The Sunday-Sabbath and the World’s Fair.” This we do, more to show the division which exists among Sunday observers upon this question, than because we fully agree with the scheme which he proposes. We see no reason why the Fair should be made a monster exhibition of the religions of the world. Indeed, it is not clear to us that Mr. Utter’s plan does not embody features quite as objectionable as those involved in Sunday-closing.

OF the paternal tendency of the times the *Colorado Graphic* says:—

> Now enforce the eight-hour law in all industries—for none can be omitted, to reach final results—at ten-hour wages; close all places of business at 6 o’clock P. M., and close gateways, doors, and shutters to every business and every amusement and recreation on Sunday except walking, or riding in one’s private carriage, and you will establish an aristocracy with an emphatic stop which would startle the most stupid into a realization of the fact that the middle of the street is the best side of the highway when fanaticism is abroad.

And there never was a time in the history of this country when fanaticism was so general and pronounced as now.

THE *Christian Advocate*, of this city, objects to political meetings on Sunday. It says:—

> Political meetings in churches, with bands, stirring music and applause “that makes the old church ring,” are not good meetings for Sabbaths, no matter what the cause is. The great foes of the American Sabbath in settled communities are excursions, Sunday newspapers, Sunday camp-meetings with open gates, political meetings, comic lectures under the guise of sermons, and concerts profanely called sacred.

This indicates very clearly the drift of the Sunday-law movement. Where they have no Sunday law such laws are demanded, professedly, in order to give the workingman a day of rest. Where such laws already exist the demand is that they be so amended as to forbid everything on Sunday not recognized by the churches as religious.

THE Baptist Ministers’ Conference closed at Lockport, New York, on the 29th ult., with a direct blow at the effort of certain misguided religionists to create a public sentiment in favor of introducing religious instruction into the public schools of the State, by refusing to co-operate in this attempt, and holding that it would tend to the establishment of schools at State expense, in which would be taught the principles of many creeds. If the State may direct religion in schools, the Conference holds, it can in churches.

MR. CRAFTS says: “In other countries, where Church and State are mixed, and in our own country in other days, the ground of Sunday laws has been not always clearly perceived; but in recent years legislation on this subject has been based, not on God’s will, but on the general welfare.” It is true that within the last few years an effort has been made to keep in the background the real reason for demanding Sunday laws, but that the effort has not been eminently successful is shown by every discourse which Mr. Crafts gives. His declaration, “Take the religion out and you take the rest out,” upsets all his fine spun theories about the civil basis of Sunday legislation.

AT the Indian Conference at Lake Mo- honk, N. Y., October 10, Dr. James M. King, of New York, Secretary of the National League for the Protection of American Liberties, spoke earnestly against the granting of appropriations to religious denominations for public educational work. General Armstrong argued that there is no better way than to give aid to the contract schools. Bishop Whipple said that the influence of the contract schools had been to uplift the whole character of the Government schools. The position of Bishop Whipple was sustained by General Howard, of Chicago, Rev. Mr. Mitchell, of the Presbyterian Board of Missions, and others. A speedy separation of Church and State in the matter of Indian education was advocated by Rev. Dr. Foster, of Boston, and very strongly by Dr. Lyman Abbott.

THE ministers of Omaha have declared themselves opposed to funerals on Sunday. Upon this fact the *Investigator,* Atlantic, Iowa, remarks as follows:—

> These ministers doubtless think if a man is so heedless as to die upon Friday or Saturday, he must wait until Monday for interment “with the benefit of clergy.” What right has a man to depart this life at such time that his burial must take place on the day of rest? Why shall he not go on Monday or Tuesday, and thus save all danger of offending the pulpit by his being entombed on the Sabbath? He who would thus break in upon the rest of the preachers and deacons, deserves not to die at all. If he may do this with impunity, this day will soon be “secularized,” and turned into one of wholesale interment. It behooves the friends of the Sabbath to rise up as one man in opposition to the reprehensible custom among people, of dying when they are ready. But, seriously, cannot the Omaha gentlemen of the cloth find evils more deserving of their attention than this one?

Well, “seriously,” it seems not; for the mint, anise and cummin are receiving the lion’s share of attention, while the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith, are neglected. And this is true in more places than Omaha.

A DECISION has been rendered lately by the Supreme Court of the State of Indiana, which holds that the carrying of passengers to and from a picnic on Sunday is unlawful.

As, by this decision, the highest judicial authority of the State has declared, in effect, all labor, other than works of necessity and mercy, to be illegal on Sunday, therefore, according to the National Reform doctrine, the Hoosier State has become a Christian commonwealth and has instituted a local millennium. The eyes of the world will now be turned upon this favored State. Henry George will hasten to become a citizen where every man will sit under his own vine and fig tree with no tariff bill to molest or make him afraid; and Edward Bellamy will pack up his fountain pen and case of pencils, and immediately betake himself to the land where religious nationalism is ushering in the age so aptly termed, “Looking Backward.”

“SIBERIA and the Nihilists,” consisting of an able lecture by Hon. William Jackson Armstrong, late Inspector General of United States Consulates, and some exceedingly interesting correspondence between Mr. Armstrong and George Kennan, is one of the most intensely interesting books which has ever found its way to our table. Everybody should read this book because no one can be intelligent upon the subject of which it treats without a familiarity with its contents.
