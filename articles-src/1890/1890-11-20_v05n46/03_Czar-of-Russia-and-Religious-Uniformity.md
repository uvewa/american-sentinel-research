THE Czar of Russia, in the exercise of his paternal sovereignty, has ordered the Protestant missionaries to leave Russia, to cease proselyting. He has also ordered all Jews to leave his dominions, and the order is being carried out with great severity. In the Baltic provinces he is crushing out Lutheranism and the German language. It is evident that the paternal ruler has taken his cue from the dethroned Pope, who secured uniformity of religion and language by the same tyrannical, oppressive means. By the way, the Czar is head of the Greek Church. This is another fact that illustrates the folly, or, more properly, the crime of uniting Church and State. Politics and religion, when mixed in a ruler, bring misery and poverty to the people. *—Loyal American.*
