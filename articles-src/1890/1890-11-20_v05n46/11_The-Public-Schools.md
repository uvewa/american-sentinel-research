IT is not the business of the public schools to give a complete education, or even an approximation thereto. The principles upon which they are founded is simply to go so far as within reasonable limitations, may be deemed necessary for the protection and safety of the State. Beyond this we have no business to go. Religion is an individual want or realization, which pertains to the individual alone, or, distinct from his rights and duties, as represented in the State—a part of which he is, and in all of which he bears a responsible share, over and above any allegiance which he owes to his own spiritual nature or the religious powers which represent this element in the ecclesiastical organism which gives form and force to the outward acts of man.

If there are any deficiencies they should be supplied in some other way. If religion could be taught, it should be taught by the church, where each can be represented in its own way, and where each can be cared for without interference from the other. The public school is the creature of the State, and the State, in this country, is inherently and distinctively republican. So that if you want to set aside or modify the school, in this respect, to suit the special religious views of any [365] sect or church, the first thing will be to break down the principle upon which they rest. That is, republican government. If that is legitimate and right they must stand intact, and perform their duties in perfect harmony therewith. And, in this respect, there can be no distinction. All are equal and all are entitled to receive whatever education may be legitimate with this end in view.

Therefore, it must be common, in which all agree, as far as it goes. And hence all who agree in republican- government must be supplied with an education that simply conforms therewith. And so the schools being creatures of the State, which is itself secular, must be of a secular character; and their secular character must not be tampered with or encroached upon by any religious body, Catholic or Protestant.

The public schools are for all creeds, or no creed—Catholic, Protestant, or Agnostic; for all nationalities, native-born and foreign—for the American, the Irishman, the German or Italian. This makes them impartial, secular and comprehensive. No other system can exist in this country so long as it is republican in manner and form.—*The National View.*
