# A Republic Indeed!

THE following is from an article by Rev. R. C. Wylie, in the *Christian Statesman.* It was, so far as we are able to judge, written in all seriousness, and evidently with the expectation that some, at least, would receive it as true. Mr. Wylie says:—

> The Hebrews had neither rulers nor laws until they themselves elected the first and enacted the second. The people by a popular vote ratified the Constitution and laws given to Moses at Sinai. The people also elected their rulers, and these too by divine command. It is somewhat amusing to find a certain class of people in modern times denying that Israel was at first a republic. The only rational method of accounting for this denial is on the supposition that the people are the special agents of the prince of the power of the air to antagonize the National Reform movement, and so zealous are they in the service of their Satanic master that they do not hesitate to deny anything that we may assert. No scholar, and in fact no person who has read twenty chapters of the book of Exodus, would ever think of denying that Israel was a republic, if he had any regard for the truth.

How to fitly characterize such statements we know not. Nothing but the blindness of bigotry and superstition could ever cause any sane man to write such stuff with the expectation that it would meet with any credence whatever. The theory that Israel was ever a republic, or anything akin to a republic, is a new theory coined and given to the world solely for the purpose of concealing the native iniquity of the so-called National Reform movement. “No scholar, and in fact no person who has read twenty chapters of the book of Exodus,” would ever think of asserting that Israel was a republic, “if he had any regard for the truth.” It is not the commonly accepted view, nor is it the view held by anybody except National Reformers who are driven to take that position by the necessities of the case. Several papers, whose editors have shown more zeal than discretion or knowledge of the Scriptures, have been attempting to strengthen the claims of women to seats in the Methodist Episcopal General Conference by the following arguments *a la *National Reform:—

> Miriam was in the General Conference of God’s church, for it is said: “He led forth the people by Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.”

In annihilating this so-called argument, the *Christian Advocate,* of this city, incidentally deals Mr. Wylie’s claim a heavy blow, as follows:—

> There is no such passage of Scripture. If there were it would mean nothing, for *in Miriam’s, time there was no representation, no law-making by human beings, but laws came direct from God. *Miriam had great ability, and was a stronger character than Aaron, but her last public appearance was in the capacity of claiming more authority than God gave her; for that she was made leprous.

We have italicized the sentence bearing directly upon this question. The *Advocate* has stated the truth; in the time of Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, there was no representation, no law-making by human beings. The Hebrews neither elected their own rulers, nor enacted their own laws. Even Moses, so often called, “the lawgiver of Israel,” was not such in fact, for he never made a single law; but only enforced those that he received directly from God. The seventy elders of Israel were not elected. They represented Israel only because they were heads of families. As one writer on this subject remarks: “The patriarchal system existed to the time of the exodus. ‘Elders’ were aged men, heads of families or tribes. The father of the family was priest and ruler, no matter how old his sons might be, nor how numerous their families. And his prerogative descended to the first-born. This order continued until the Lord chose one family to serve as priests for the nation. At first, elders were such in this sense only.”

These, and similar facts are known to everybody except National Reformers, and they too might know them if they would only study the Scriptures instead of the perversions of Scripture which drizzle from the pens of their District Secretaries, and acquire some claim to consideration by reason of being printed in a paper bearing the name “Christian.”C.
