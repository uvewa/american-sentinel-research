A CORRESPONDENT sends us a long defense of Sunday laws, from which we take the following extract:—

> The question involves nothing more nor less than the conscience of the individual in conflict with the will of the State, and the decision heretofore by eminent jurists, has been, that "the State must not waver." Why? Because "the State is supreme." If the will of the State is to be bandied about "by every wind of doctrine," then it will be plain to every reasoning mind, the State can never proceed upon any well-regulated system of law, and "without system there can be no rule of action," which will not do for a State. Well, but, you will now say, the State has nothing to do with conscience. Indeed! I have just shown that where the will of the State is opposed by the conscience of the individual "the State must not waver."

Certainly "the question is nothing more nor less than the conscience of the individual in conflict with the will of the State;" it does not follow, however, that "the State must not waver." In its legitimate sphere "the State is supreme and must not waver;" but the domain of conscience is a domain that the State has no right to invade. By "conscience," we mean, as defined by Webster, "the faculty, power, or principle which decides on the lawfulness or unlawfulness of our actions [the divine law being the standard], and approves or condemns them."

This domain, we say, the State has no right to invade; and it needs no extended argument to prove this proposition. It has been truly said of civil government, that "the domain which it invades it dominates; the jurisdiction which it takes it keeps." This fact alone should forever exclude it from the sacred precincts of the soul, for no man can ever surrender his conscience to the keeping of another and maintain his own self-respect, to say nothing of his loyalty to his God.

Governments have in past ages assumed to dominate the realm of conscience; the sequel is the history of the Inquisition. The thumbscrew, the rack, and the fagot are inseparable from the theory advocated by our correspondent. He may affirm that he would not carry it so far as that, but it is impossible for him to stop short of it without abandoning his theory. It is for this reason that we oppose all Sunday laws; they are the beginnings of intolerance; they necessarily trench upon the most sacred right of man, namely, the right to worship (which carries with it the right not to worship) just as seemeth him good.

Sunday is, and always was, a religious festival. It was originally sacred to the worship of the sun god, and is now very generally regarded as commemorating the resurrection of Christ, and is by many held to be the Sabbath. If it were not regarded as sacred there would be no demand for laws enforcing its observance. It is therefore a matter that the State has no right to touch.

It is true that the friends of Sunday legislation have learned wisdom by past experience, and endeavor as much as possible to keep in the background the fact that their motive is religious, but they can never get away from the facts. They demand a "civil Sabbath;" but what they mean is a religious Sabbath enforced by civil law. Mr. Crafts himself says: "Take the religion out and you take the rest out;" and right in harmony with this utterance is the following "plank" from the platform of the Pennsylvania Prohibitionists:—

> The Sabbath must be preserved by the due enforcement of existing laws and the speedy enactment of such additional legislation as may be necessary to insure its due observance.

The words "Sabbath" and "due observance" are not civil, or secular, but religious terms, and the thought back of them was a religious thought. It is not physical rest but spiritual worship that is the object of Sunday laws. The plea that "all must rest or none can," is negatived by the fact that thousands do rest upon days when the majority are at work. All told, our country contains probably fifty thousand seventh-day Christians, who conscientiously and habitually rest upon the seventh day, the busiest day of all the week, and they find no difficulty in doing so, and desire no law compelling others to rest at the same time.

Again, this is a question with which majorities and minorities have nothing to do. The rights of a single individual are just as sacred, and should be just as carefully guarded as the rights of a multitude. The State properly protects from interruption religious meetings upon every day; and it very properly does the same for other meetings. Such laws are right, they apply to all people and to all days, but laws setting apart certain days for religious purposes and stopping on those days all the ordinary avocations of life, are opposed to the spirit of our institutions, and to the spirit of true Christianity; and should be opposed alike by the patriot and by the Christian.

This is the principle upon which we stand; we could not, with our understanding of the word of God, do otherwise and maintain our Christian integrity.
