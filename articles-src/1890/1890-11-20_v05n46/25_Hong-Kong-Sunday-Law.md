WE learn from the *China Mail* that a law forbidding Sunday labor in the harbor of Hong-Kong is among the probabilities of the near future. At a recent meeting of the Mercantile Marine Officers' Association held at Marine Hotel on Saturday evening, Captain S. Ashton, the President, addressed the members on the Sunday labor question. After alluding to "the good work" done by Rev. A. G. Goldsmith, with a view to bringing about a cessation of Sunday labor in the harbor, President Ashton said that he was a firm believer in the fourth commandment, and he thought those who obeyed it would "be healthier, wealthier, and wiser in the end." As in this country, the great plea for this Sunday law is that the laboring man may have opportunity to rest, and, as here, it appears that the real motive of the prime movers is their religious regard for the day. Were Sunday not religious the plea for a rest day for the "poor working man" would never be made.
