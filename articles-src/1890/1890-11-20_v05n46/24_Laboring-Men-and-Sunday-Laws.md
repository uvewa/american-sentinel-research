"ISN'T it strange," says a Western paper, "that the laboring men, who are represented by the Sunday-law lecturers as consuming with desire for a Sunday law, are in mortal dread of saying anything about it, lest they should lose their places, and yet they will strike for an advance of twenty-five cents a day in wages, or even when they have no personal grievance, if a fellow-workman is discharged?" Well, yes, it would be strange if the representations of the Sunday-law advocates were all true; but inasmuch as they are not true the only strange thing about it is that men professing godliness will resort to duplicity to accomplish what they imagine to be a great moral reform. The J esuits should be awarded a monopoly of "doing evil that good may come."
