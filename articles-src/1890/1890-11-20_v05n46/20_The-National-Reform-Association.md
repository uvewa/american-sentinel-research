THERE is no doubt that there is a class of people in America whose aim is to subvert our American institutions. This class are now working in Idaho for the purpose of establishing a theocracy. The green-eyed monster has fastened its covetous eyes upon our infantile commonwealth, and as an entering wedge it proposes to introduce a Sunday bill into our Legislature.

We have just been divorced from one church that demands of its adherents implicit obedience in matters both temporal and spiritual, and thank God and our worthy politicians, that we are free. Let not our Legislature be deceived. The National Reform Association is a foe to our form of Government. Article II of their Constitution reads as follows:—

> The object of this society shall be to maintain existing Christian features in the American Government; to promote needed reforms in the action of the Government touching the Sabbath, the institution of the family, the religious element in education, the oath, and public morality as affected by the liquor traffic and other kindred evils; and to secure such an amendment to the Constitution of the United States as will declare the Nation's allegiance to Jesus Christ and its acceptance of the moral laws of the Christian religion, and so indicate that this is a Christian Nation, and place all the Christian laws, institutions and usages on an undeniably legal basis in the fundamental law of the land.

Let these principles prevail and our Government becomes a theocracy. There is in reality no such thing as a union of Church and State; both claim to be supreme, and they both should be supreme, but in their own realm. Let the Church dictate in secular matters and the bloody scenes of the Dark Ages will be re-enacted. Men and women would be imprisoned for conscience' sake. The history of Church rule is a history of bloodshed, a history of persecution. Men and women were burned at the stake for their belief. It was the Church that burned John Rogers at the stake, cut out Quaker's tongues, drowned witches, burned Servetus, condemned Joan of Arc, delivered her to the British soldiers to suffer death, then washed its hypocritical hands in innocency. If the Church would follow Christ, let it attend to its spiritual affairs and let the State manage the temporal matters.—*Idaho World. *[367-368]
