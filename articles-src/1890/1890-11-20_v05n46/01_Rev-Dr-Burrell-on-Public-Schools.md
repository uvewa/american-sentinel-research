OUR public schools are secular, and must ever remain so if religious freedom is to abide. Let the churches look to the matter of religious education; we Presbyterians will do our part to it, and we ask no subsidy. Let the fathers and mothers do their part; ounce of mother is worth a pound of priest." And let the State attend to its own business in the non-sectarian education of the children of the land.—*Rev. Dr. Burrell.*
