THE Sunday question seems to be just as perplexing in Hong-Kong as in America. The advocates there of enforced Sunday rest get just as badly tangled in its intricacies as they do here, and in a very similar manner, as is witnessed by the following extracts from an article in the *China Mail* in advocacy of a Sunday law for the harbor of Hong-Kong:—

> I do not think there is one man in the Colony who would support compulsory Sunday observance throughout the Colony. Even if it were possible to enforce such a law, it would be a curse instead of a blessing.

Thus readeth extract No. 1. Number 2 is as follows:—

> It would no doubt be well if this rest could be secured by voluntary co-operation, but that I fear is impracticable. Compulsory measures—always objectionable in themselves—have been sanctioned at home, and will I fear have to be resorted to in Hong-Kong.

Just so! It has been so; therefore, it must be so. This is the logic of Sunday laws the world over.
