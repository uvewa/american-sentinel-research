IN matters of political economy the church is not authorized to expound God's will. Every time she has tried it she has done no end of mischief, and never any good. Our Lord refused to be a judge in the distribution of property, and he never gave to his church an authority he would not assume for himself. What Jesus did was to forbid oppression, but what oppression was in a particular case he did not decide. Solomon might have done that, Caiaphas might do that, but it was not for Him to do it. He asserted principles of love, unselfishness, order, but particular cases under those principles he never decided. He cried out for justice, mercy, and truth, but which brother had the right on his side was for the civil courts to determine. Who made me a judge over you? What right have I to decide these questions?

There is the guiding light for the Church in all ages. It lays down great principles, but it throws upon men the responsibility of deciding what is best and right under those principles. In the old slavery days in this country it was the duty of the Church to speak about the iniquity of human bondage, to speak of the sacredness of man, but it left men to decide how that iniquity was to be abrogated. It had no right to say that its members should go to the polls and vote with one political party as against the other. It is its duty to talk about the evils of intemperance, to urge men to sobriety in every possible way, but it has no right to say because a certain governor is commonly believed to be in league with the saloons that no man can be a Christian and vote for him, nor has it any right to bind all its members to vote for prohibition or high license. The Lutherans of Illinois, according to recent papers, are making a political issue, fighting out at the polls a certain matter which they think nearly concerns them, and in my view it is a great mistake.—*Rev. John K. Allen*,* in Christian at Work.*
