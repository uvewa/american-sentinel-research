ACCORDING to the *Morning Journal, *Colonel Ingersoll says that "if we should finally invent some means of traveling by which we could go a thousand miles a day, a man could escape Sunday all his life by traveling west. He could start Monday, and stay in Monday all the time." The Colonel will have to invent some better argument than that against Sunday laws or they will, we fear, remain on the statute books of the several States. We don't wonder that Ingersoll said this, but we are surprised that any paper would think it worth printing. To escape Sunday all his life one would have to travel about twenty-five thousand miles a day.
