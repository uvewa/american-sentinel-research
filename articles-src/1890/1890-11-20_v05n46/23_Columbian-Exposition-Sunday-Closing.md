THE standard argument used to win the masses to Sunday closing for the Columbian Exposition, is "that Sunday opening is *not* a boon to the working people, for it means unremittent toil for thousands of them—seven day's work for six day's pay." These words are from the *Union Signal, *but the *Observer* of this city, comes nearer the truth when it says: "Sunday opening is opposed solely in the interests of the Christian Sabbath, of rest from toil, and of holy occupation." And that is just what we have said all the time, namely, that were it not for their religious regard for the day not one of the champions of so-called civil Sunday laws would lift his voice, or wield his pen, in advocacy of a day of rest for the working man. "Take the religion out and you take the rest out," says Mr. Crafts, and it is equally true that take the religion out and you take out all the interest that the ministers and churches have in the matter. The Sunday movement is not a movement for the amelioration of labor, but for the bolstering up of emasculated Christianity by civil law.
