# Above All Human Law.

THE religion of the Bible needs no legal enactments in its support, its charms are unmatched, its morals inimitable, and its power over those in whose hearts it dwells unequaled by anything in this world; and those who ask for laws to enforce compliance with it give evidence that they are devoid of its principles, and have little idea of its practical effects. To ask for civil laws to support any religion is a tacit admission of the weakness of that religion. It is saying that the religion is no stronger than the laws which support it. But the Christian religion is high above all human law, hence needs none in its support. And he who says it does, degrades Christianity and puts its Author to “an open shame.”—*Southern Sentinel.*

LET religion be taught in the churches and Sabbath schools, and not in the public schools.—*Leadville Argus*.
