# Sunday Legislation in Canada.

THE following extract taken from a letter published in the *Review and Herald*, and written by R. S. Owen, of Canada, shows in a very clear light the attitude of the rank and file of the Catholic priesthood toward Sunday legislation and religious laws:—

“We called on several priests to interview them in regard to their attitude toward Sunday legislation in the Dominion Parliament. There seems to be a general feeling of hostility among them toward the Sunday bill introduced in the last session of Parliament. They are not opposed because of love for religious liberty, but because it is too strict, and would prohibit games and amusements, as well as work, on Sunday. ‘A little hunting, a little fishing, and playing cards, is not wrong,’ say they, ‘after the devotional exercises of the Sunday are over.’ But the ordinary work, the ‘ grand hunting and grand fishing,’ they would have prohibited. We inquired: ‘Do you regard Sunday as standing on the same basis as the other holy days of the church?’ ‘Yes,’ was the reply, ‘they are all alike.’ ‘Then would you have the observance of all those days enforced by law? ’ ‘Yes,’ said one priest, ‘that is just what we want.’

“They want the Government to interfere with religious matters, only when requested to do so by the Catholic Church. ‘When the church requests the aid of the Government, then it should stand ready to come to its assistance.’ It is evident that when Rome gets the civil powers to do her bidding, she will not stop with Sunday laws. When Protestants succeed in securing religious legislation, they will have opened a door for Catholics to enter, which, they may find to their sorrow, will be hard to close again.”
