"A REST day is justified," says Dr. McDonald, a prominent Sunday-law advocate, "upon the principle that the privilege of rest for each citizen depends upon the observance of one day of rest in seven, by everybody." But the assumption is false. Mr. Crafts himself says that "the Jew is left absolutely free to observe the seventh day." True enough; and so is every one else left absolutely free to keep the first day.
