THE *News-Banner,* of Troy, Tennessee, in its issue of November 6, publishes the following item:—

> Robert M. King, the Seventh-day Adventist, who was tried in the circuit court, and sentenced to pay a seventy-five dollar fine for working on Sunday, and who appealed to the State Supreme Court, and had the decision affirmed, is in trouble.

> Lawyer Richardson, of Dyersburg, is going to appeal the case to the Supreme Court of the United States, and has telegraphed to get Don. M. Dickinson, Post-master General under the Cleveland administration, to take charge of the case.
> The time has come when King must pay the seventy-five dollar fine or go to jail. He says that it is religious persecution, and that he will go to jail before he will pay one cent. King is now in charge of Sheriff Jackson, awaiting the result of Colonel Richardson's efforts towards securing an appeal.
Mr. King writes a very interesting personal letter from the Obion County Jail, at Troy, narrating his experiences in confinement, his opportunities for conversation on Biblical truth, etc. He says of those who have him in charge, "I am treated just as kindly by the jailer as possibly could be expected," and mentions unexpected courtesies shown him by others.

While in jail he has been "interviewed" by a representative of the county paper, and this is his crisp account of the conversation:—

> The editor of the *News-Banner* came down yesterday, and I had quite a talk with him. He asked me if the Judge would turn me out would I go home and quit work on Sunday? I told him that I could not promise that. I told him that I thought that I had a God-given right to work six days if I chose to do so. He also asked me if I would leave the State if the Governor would pardon me? I told him, No, sir!

In the United States of America, during the last decade of the nineteenth century, a man, without known fault as a Christian and a citizen, is fined and imprisoned because in his devout simplicity, he reads in his Bible the commandment of God, "Six days shall thou labor and do all thy work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, in it thou shalt do no work," etc., and acts accordingly. Is it possible to imagine a more ludicrous travesty on justice, true religion, and common sense?
