SOME alarm has been felt in some parts of the West lest through the influence of parochial schools the rising generation should be kept in ignorance of the English language. We regard this fear as utterly groundless. How German Lutherans themselves look at the question will be seen from the following article from the *Vindicator,* a Lutheran paper, published in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania:—

The opinion is freely expressed on all hands that the German language in this country will, sooner or later, die out. At the meeting of the Kansas District of the Missouri Synod, in Atchison, Kansas, last September, this opinion was expressed—not by young men and unthinking enthusiasts—but by aged men of wide and varied experience. Everybody seems to become gradually reconciled to the inevitable; so then all that remains to be done is to draw the legitimate conclusions and to act upon the hint.

Well, then, if that comes to pass what the wisest among us predict and concede to be inevitable, what is to become of our German Lutheran Church? Shall it die with the language? Perish the thought! No true Lutheran can bear even to think of such a thing! And yet this must inevitably be the fate of the church unless sufficient provision is made to preach our doctrines in the English language. Or are we waiting for thé precise moment when the climax shall have been reached, then all at once make German congregations English? We all know that such a thing is impossible. A change like the one in question must be accomplished gradually. There will be no discharge of artillery to warn us of the necessity of a change. No [366] angel will appear to tell us; "now is the time, up and change your tactics!" We are bidden to read the signs of the times. Some of the German churches being emptied of young people ought to be sign sufficient that the time has come. Therefore we believe that English Lutheran congregations should be established *wherever an opportunity offers.* If we will not do so now the opportunity may be past by the time we are ready to act. Difficulties? Certainly the work is difficult, but so is all work worthy the effort of an honest man and a Christian. We cannot say that it is impossible, for we have not yet made an earnest and vigorous effort. We ought not to complain of small success, because, being new in the work we naturally make many mistakes. But then the Lord has not promised us brilliant success, nor any certain degree of success; but has said that his word, if preached faithfully shall not remain without fruits, and that ought to be sufficient for us.

Some will fear the danger that English Lutheran congregations will swerve from the standard of true Lutheranism. If this hitherto has sometimes happened, it is not to be wondered at. For they were exposed more than the German congregations to the influence of the sects around them, while they had but few truly Lutheran books and papers. But this ought not to discourage us, but rather act as an incentive to vigorous exertions in order that we may make the writings of the fathers of our church accessible to English speaking people. And when that has once been accomplished, doubt not that there will be as good English Lutheranism as there ever was in any other language.

The work may not be exactly such as we would choose were a choice left open. But it is thrust upon us, and seeing that it is, as all admit, either an English Lutheran Church or no Lutheran Church at all in this country, shall we any longer rest content with weak, half-hearted, tentative efforts? Will we continue to allow ourselves to be pushed and forced by dire necessity and by the force of circumstances? In several cases the opportunity was just slipping away from us before we were aroused. Already, in several places we are too late—not too late to do any good, but too late for the greatest measure of good. When the most favorable opportunity had passed then we arrived upon the scene. Too late! May it never be the fate of the Lutheran Church, nor of any section of it, to say of the performance of her duties—too late!
