A CHURCH known to be the slave of the State would not have much influence with the mass of the people in restraining anarchy and making them good citizens, and politicians would ever be tempted to turn aside the Church from its proper spiritual work. The heresy, for it is a heresy, of making the Church subservient to the State, is called Erastianism because inculcated by Erastus, a learned physician in Heidelberg toward the end of the sixteenth century, who claimed for the civil magistrate the power of exercising discipline and of excommunication in the Church.—*James McCosh, D.D.*,* LL.D.*,* Princton*, *New Jersey.*
