A MEMBER of the Shaker Order, at Mount Lebanon, New York, writes to us saying:—

> I wish that you could see, as I do, that the God of Israel was only a created being—a tutelary deity.

Well we can't see it; and furthermore it has nothing to do with the question of governmental regulation of religion and religious observances. We are Christians and believe most sincerely that Jehovah, the God of the Jews, is a self-existent being, that he created all things by Jesus Christ, and that the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are his revealed will; but with Paine, the infidel, we would say to all who assume to dictate to their fellows in matters of religion: "Who art thou, vain dust and ashes! by whatsoever name thou art called, whether a king, a bishop, a Church, or a State, a parliament or anything else, that obtrudest thine insignificance between the soul of man and his Maker? Mind thine own concerns. If he believest not as thou believest, it is a proof that thou believest not as he believest, and there is no earthly power that can determine between you." Nevertheless we hold that it is the duty of all men to "fear God and keep his commandments;" "for God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil." Eccl. 12:13, 14.
