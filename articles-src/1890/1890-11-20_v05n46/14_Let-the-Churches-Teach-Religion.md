THE unsectarianism of our public school system is the secret of its whole power, so that to sectarianize it would be to utterly destroy it. It is an American axiom that the perpetuity of our civil and religious freedom depends on a complete severance of Church and State. No loyal American who is acquainted with the theory and history of our Government will question that postulate for a moment. The First Amendment to our national Constitution is in these words: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion." That settles the matter. Our public schools must be carried on consistently with that idea; there must be no sectarianism there; there must be no "establishment of religion" in connection with any of our national institutions; certainly not in the public schools, where children are being trained for citizenship at the public expense.

I believe in parochial-schools. We have hundreds of Presbyterian schools, and the Baptists have hundreds more, but these are not sustained at the public expense. We expect to go on teaching the Westminster Confession of Faith in our denominational schools, but we have not the brazen effrontery to ask the commonwealth to foot the bills. If we choose to have a Presbyterian dance we will pay the piper with Presbyterian money. And that, too, while loyally supporting the non-sectarian public schools. There is room for both. The public schools, however, must always and everywhere be of such a character that parents may send their children to them with a definite assurance that their rights of conscience shall not be violated by the propaganda of any sect. Only so can our religious freedom be protected and secured for coming days.—*Rev. Dr. Burrell.*
