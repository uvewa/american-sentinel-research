IN reply to our advice to "read the twelfth chapter of Paul's 4 Epistle to the Romans,' to learn what practical Bible Christianity is," the *Truth Seeker* devotes nearly a page to an attempt to discredit the Scriptures, and after quoting a number of texts which infidels generally regard as objectionable, says:—

> We trust that our religious contemporary will be kind enough to say whether it approves of the practical Bible Christianity outlined in the passages we have quoted; and if it does not to say why.

Space forbids any extended answer to the *Truth Seeker's* effort. It is not the mission of this paper to discuss Bible truth, further than it bears directly upon the proper relations of Church and State. Nevertheless, believing that a courteous question demands a candid reply, we will say that THE SENTINEL is a Christian paper, and that its editors heartily accept the Scriptures as the revealed will of God. We do not, however, accept the interpretation put by infidels upon the texts quoted by our Lafayette Place contemporary. For instance, the *Truth Seeker* says:—

> In chapter twelve of the 'Epistle to the Romans,' Paul recommends honesty (ver. 17); but in the third chapter he says:—

> For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory, why yet am I also judged as a sinner?
> Perhaps Paul was trying to make the truth of God abound when he recommended the providing of honest things, for he admits to the Corinthians that he caught them with guile (2 Cor. 12:16). That, we suppose, is "practical Bible Christianity," as the vote buying, slandering of opponents, and deception of the people nowadays by Christian statesmen is "practical politics."
We dislike to impute to anybody wrong motives, but in this case we can scarcely think that the editor of the *Truth Seeker *does not know that Paul was arguing against the very thing of which infidels accuse him, namely, of doing evil that good might come. The apostle says that this was "slanderously reported" of him then; and it seems that some are still circulating the same old slander.

Of guile, Webster says: "Craft; cunning; artifice; duplicity; deceit;—usually in a bad sense." But the apostle does not use it in a bad sense; indeed, he did not use the word "guile" at all, but a word meaning "artifice." The Diaglott renders it: "I did not burden you; but being cunning, I took you by artifice." Paul simply used good judgment in dealing with men; he combined the wisdom of the serpent with the harmlessness of the dove. This is well illustrated by his sermon on Mars Hill (Acts 17:22-31); instead of preaching to them from the Jewish Scriptures, he took for his text an inscription on one of their own altars and quoted to them their own poets; it was thus that Paul used guile.

The difficulties which the *Truth Seeker *finds in the other texts cited are only imaginary, as we have shown them to be in Rom. 3:7 and 2 Cor. 12:16, and we must still insist that it is unjust for that paper to charge upon Christianity all the faults of much of that which to-day is called Christianity. Men professing to be Christians are guilty of "vote buying, slandering of opponents, and deception of the people," but they are not Bible Christians, and we want the *Truth Seeker* to recognize the fact. The Bible standard of morals is infinitely higher than is the practice of many who call themselves Christians. The *Truth Seeker* may deny this, but fortunately its *ipse dixit* does not make true that which it asserts. The idea that Christianity is immoral is negatived not only by the facts, but by the admission of infidels themselves; and it is too late in the history of the world for unbelievers to oppose the religion of the Lord Jesus Christ because it is immoral. The world knows better; and we think that the *Truth Seeker* must certainly know better too.
