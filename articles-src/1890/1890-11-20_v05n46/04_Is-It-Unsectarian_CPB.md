PRESIDENT WESTBROOK'S call for the Congress of the American Secular Union, recently held at Portsmouth, Ohio, contained the following statement, which we wish to examine a little in the light of the Congress itself, and of the official utterances made there:—

> The American Secular Union is strictly unsectarian and non-partisan in both religion and politics. It is not, either publicly or privately, committed to the advancement of any system of religious belief or disbelief, but heartily welcomes all persons, of whatever faith, to its membership, on the basis of "no union of Church and State." The word "secular" is here used in the broadest sense, as applied to the State, and not to any system of religious philosophy.

The object of the Union is thus stated, by Mr. Westbrook, in the same call:—

> Its object is to secure the total separation of Church and State, in fact and in form, to the end that equal rights in religion, genuine morality in politics, and freedom, virtue, and brotherhood be established, protected, and perpetuated.

With this we have no fault to find. On the contrary we hold that this is a worthy object. We fear, however, that instead of being *the* object it is only *an* object, and possibly a secondary object at that. In giving an account of the opening of the Portsmouth Congress, the *Truth Seeker *says:—

> The hall was filled to hear J. L. Treuthart welcome his fellow-Freethinkers. The Portsmouth Union, he said, welcomed the Congress as a child receives a visit of a parent. There was also a large public sentiment favoring the objects of the Union. He also welcomed the Union on behalf of the school children who were entitled to know that facts never contradict truth. For two thousand years the astronomers had been making almanacs, and calculating eclipses and other movements of the heavenly bodies. What would become of astronomy, he asked, if some Joshua could take hold of the spokes of the wheel of time and stop the revolution of the earth?

Now we do not deny Mr. Treuthart's right to say just what he pleases about the story of Joshua; but why he should address a "strictly unsectarian" Congress in that manner does not seem clear. Nor do we understand what it has to do with the separation of Church and State. However, this was unofficial, and we will leave it for something from one of the officers of the Union. In her official address, the Corresponding Secretary, Miss Ida Craddock, said:—

> At this time the American Secular Union is confronted with two distinct lines of policy from which to choose. One is the policy which it has steadily maintained during the past year, of strict non-partisanship in religious matters, and open- handed hospitality to all who believe in total separation of Church and State, whether the applicant for membership be Deist or Atheist, Freethinker or Churchman.

> The other policy looks further than the mere separation of Church and State. It demands perpetual and unflinching hostility to the Christian religion, and an aggressive warfare whose aim is finally to cripple the Church, if not to kill it off entirely.
This states that there are two lines of policy, but is non-committal as to which one the Union has adopted; nor does it say which one Miss Craddock herself thinks the better one. The following from the same address, however, supplies the lack, and is a declaration of war on religion:—

> But my great concern is: How shall we reach the young? How shall we save them from falling into that religious superstition which puts the cross higher than their moral duty as good citizens, and which teaches them to consider what the Church sneeringly calls "mere morality" as of little account in the sight of the Deity whom they worship?.... How shall we fit them to take the vacant places in the Liberal ranks—places left vacant almost monthly by the death of our gray-haired veterans?

That is, "How shall we" (the Secular Union, of course) "make infidels of the [362] children?" And this in the face of the statement of the President that the Union is unsectarian and "not either publicly or privately committed to the advancement of any system of religious belief or *disbelief*."

Nor is this all; Miss Craddock's subject was "Organization," and she not only pointed out work to be done by the Union, but she proposed plans. The following is one of them:—

> Personally, I should like to see established throughout the country Freethought Sunday-schools, where children could be saved on Sunday from the allurements of the Church. We may be quite sure that, if we don't look out for our children on that day, the Church will draw them in.

Now we have no fault to find with this plan, nor with Miss Craddock for proposing it. The Secular Union has just the same right to teach infidelity that we have to teach Christianity; but they have no right to do it and at the same time insist that the Union is unsectarian, and that it "is not committed to the advancement of any system of belief or unbelief."

We are surprised at the attitude of the Secular Union, and especially are we surprised at the Corresponding Secretary, who at another stage of the meeting, said:—

> The policy of strict non-sectarianism in religion, which we have zealously striven to maintain during the past year, is already bearing good fruit, notwithstanding the gloomy prophecies of some few of our more radical friends throughout the country. By adopting a moderate and persuasive tone, we have succeeded in getting our principles advertised prominently in several of the leading Christian papers of the country, thus bringing our ideas before thousands of Church people who would not otherwise have known how very reasonable are the demands we make; and we have some more work of the same sort in hand now, of which we are not at liberty to speak.

So long as the Secular Union remained purely a secular affair, there was no reason why Christian journals should not advertise its principles, for "secularism" means, "The state or quality of being secular;" and "secular" means, "Pertaining to this present world, or to things not spiritual or holy." "Secularism" is not, therefore, a synonym for infidelity, and very many Christians and some Christian papers are secularists, that is, they believe in keeping Church and State entirely separate; and to this end they can co-operate with all who are laboring for the same object; but every Christian and every Christian paper must defend the Christian religion when it is attacked, or else cease to be Christian. It follows that when as an organization, the Secular Union proposes to strike down Christianity, it cuts off the co-operation of all Christians.

And not only so, but by assuming such an attitude as this, the Secular Union is strengthening the hands of the National Reformers, for they virtually say that did they believe in Christianity they too would be National Reformers. That is, opposing State recognition of religion *because they do not believe in religion* is only to say that did they believe in religion they would favor such recognition. They thus abandon the broad principle of religious liberty, the common ground upon which the purest Christians and the most pronounced infidels have in the past fought side by side for their God-given rights, and assent that the question instead of being one of inalienable human rights is one of fact. But to this we can never agree. We maintain that the truth or falsity of the Christian religion has nothing whatever to do with this question. This we believe to be the only consistent position, and to take any other is to abandon the principle of religious liberty and concede that the whole matter is only a question of majorities.

We hope to say more upon this subject next week; at which time we shall examine some of President Westbrook's reasons for opposing the reading of the Bible in schools supported by the State. We shall likewise have something to say about the proposed manual for the teaching of morality in the public schools. C. P. B.
