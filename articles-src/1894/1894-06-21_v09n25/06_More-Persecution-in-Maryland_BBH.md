THE STATE OF MARYLAND STILL continues the work of persecuting Seventh-day Adventists, finding no occasion against them except concerning the law of their God, which reads: "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, . . . for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the, sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it."

Several weeks ago two Adventists, one a minister, were arrested for working on Sunday, in Shady Side, Anne Arundel County. The latest arrest is reported from Church Hill, Queen Anne's County. The facts of the case are these: R. R. Whaley, treasurer of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, is a carpenter by trade, and is at present engaged in building a meeting-house for his society. On Sunday morning, June 3, he worked in his garden.

His neighbor became offended at the sight, though while Mr. Whaley was in the Methodist Episcopal Church he chopped wood, worked in his garden, etc., without protest. Mr. Whaley's real crime was in becoming an Adventist. This neighbor hunted around town for an officer to have Mr. Whaley arrested instantly. To the credit of one officer it is said he refused to have anything to do with the matter. Another officer, anxious to serve the cause of persecution, as well as himself in the way of fees (which the county will have to pay), was secured. After revolving the matter over in their minds, a warrant was issued for the arrest of the offending Adventist.

This officer, not content with being constable, has decreed himself a detective of the "holy Inquisition" type, and is now engaged in hunting up prey.

The Sunday law in Maryland is only pressed against Adventists, it seems, and is being resorted to by bigoted and unreasonable church members, to crush out, as they hope, Adventism. It would be a good thing for Maryland law officers as well as those who may be "drunk with the wine of Babylon," to note carefully the words recorded in Acts 5:33-42.

The Sunday law is a wicked law, and is being used for wicked purposes. Persecution has always been the rule when the State has enacted religious laws. And people who have appealed to law to force the consciences of men holding contrary views in religious matters, have not served God as they sometimes may have thought. Force is of Satan, and those who appeal to force serve this arch-enemy of God and man.
