WE print elsewhere in this paper an article, "In the Stocks for Conscience' Sake," from a Melbourne, Australia, paper, which shows that religious persecution by so-called Protestants is not confined to the United States. We have never imagined that it would be, "for all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him [the papacy], whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world;" and this they will do by receiving his mark, the badge of papal authority, the Sunday institution to which the Roman Catholic Church appeals as showing her authority to appoint fasts and holy days and to command men under sin.

Concerning this case the Bible Echo says:—

A letter from one of our brethren who attended the trial of Brethren Harry and William Firth at Parramatta, informs us that the proceedings were truly autocratic. They were not permitted to explain matters, nor to state their God-given rights in justification of their course. "Guilty or not guilty," was the demand of the magistrate, and the moment they admitted having worked on Sunday, the sentence was pronounced. They refused absolutely to pay the fines. We await with much interest the final outcome of this high-handed proceeding.

This is the same spirit that is manifested elsewhere, namely, the spirit of Satan; and why not? for it is he who instigates all persecution.
