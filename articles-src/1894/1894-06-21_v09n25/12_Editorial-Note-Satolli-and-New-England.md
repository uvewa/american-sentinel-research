MONSIGNOR SATOLLI has been so pleased, it is said, with his reception in New England, that he has said he will always stand up for New Englanders when they are accused of religious intolerance. Upon this the Christian at Work remarks: "There will be little occasion to 'stand up' for New England toleration now, though there was need for some one to do this in 1693. The status of the Roman Catholic Church in this country shows that at least the fault of religious intolerance is not chargeable upon any section." The Christian at Work is mistaken; as long as a single religious institution is enforced by law just so long religious intolerance reigns to just that extent. Sabbath-keepers in prison in several of our "free" American States are a living testimony to the survival of religious intolerance.
