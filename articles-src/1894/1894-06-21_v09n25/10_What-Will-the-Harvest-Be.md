A WESTERN paper of recent date publishes the following, which is significant:

### Anarchism by Christ.

Rev. C. B. Wilson of Greely, spoke last Sunday at Denver in Unity Church on "Anarchism." He depreciated the ignorance, prejudice, and hatred displayed or affected by people generally at the word "anarchy." Above the tramp of Coxey's Army and the sound of the great coal strike could be heard the message of anarchy. It was simply the Christian socialism taught by Christ and Paul, the first anarchists. They came into a nation bound hand and foot with rigid ecclesiastical law. They taught men to break the law and free their minds and souls. Men are born into the world to-day with no place to lay their head without asking permission of some other man. The anarchist says this should not be. He does not blame the Astors and Vanderbilts because they have thousands under tribute to them. He blames the laws of a State which allows such a system. What if silver is coined free? In a few years Wall and Lombard Streets will have it all as they now have the gold. The speaker advocated the study and inculcation of anarchy in the home, since in their application lay the solution of present social conditions.

"Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap." Such men are now sowing the wind; they shall presently reap the whirlwind. It matters not that injustice and corruption do abound; anarchy, even if it be dubbed "Christian," is not the remedy. The Lord says, "Be patient, therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord."
