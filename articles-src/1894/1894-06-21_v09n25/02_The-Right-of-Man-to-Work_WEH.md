THERE is a great deal of talk nowadays about "labor legislation," "labor organization," "labor strikes," etc. At the present time there is a great turmoil among the "laboring" classes. The trouble is, however, not caused wholly by those who work, but by some who refuse to work, and who undertake to restrain others from doing the work which they themselves will not do at the wages offered.

While there is just cause for complaint against those that "oppress the hireling in his wages," yet the methods often employed by those who are oppressed, are wrong. On this point the Chicago Herald, of May 29, says:—

Out of the events which mark each strike period some new and valuable lessons of wisdom must be learned. The most valuable lesson is to the effect that it is as cruel and criminal a wrong to prevent a man from working who wants to work, and to whom work is furnished, as it is to compel him to work when he is unable, or, from good causes, is unwilling to work.

The New York Observer, of June 7, expresses a similar sentiment, thus:—

In this country freedom of labor is an article of faith, and while the public wishes workmen well if they want to strike, it takes quite a different attitude when they attempt to force other workmen to be idle. It regards the right of every man to work at such work as he can get and at such wages as he will accept as inviolable, and when that right is interfered with, it is ready to oppose force to maintain it.

The Herald and the Observer are exactly right. And this is just what the SENTINEL has always claimed; "that it is as cruel and criminal a wrong to prevent a man from working [on Sunday or on any day] who wants to work, as it is to compel him to work [on Saturday or on any day] when, from good causes, he is unwilling to work." This correct principle, logically followed out, would blot every Sunday law in the world from the statute books, and from "common law," too.

Again: "One laborer, or a class of laborers, has no right to say that another laborer, or class, shall not work." Yet, in violation of this true principle, repeatedly in Arkansas, Tennessee, Maryland, and other States, "one laborer"—sometimes a farmer, sometimes a civil officer, and sometimes, be it said with shame, a minister of the gospel(?)—has, through the Sunday law of his state, which is nothing else than a "labor" law, for it "prevents labor" on the part of those who desire to labor,—deprived his neighbor of the privilege of laboring on the first day of the week, or even on all days of the week, by putting him under lock and key. Likewise by the formation of "vigilance committees" and the organization of "leagues" under various names—usually a misnomer—thus constituting a "class of laborers," as they have the same object in view, the same ends have been accomplished.

Furthermore, they not only said that other laborers simply should not work when they chose, but almost invariably directed their efforts against a certain "class of laborers"—those keeping the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath. The Herald says, "Any coercion by moral or physical force to compel a man to quit work is slavery." And yet only a few days ago (May 30) the nation spent a whole day in honor of those, a large part of whose work was to abolish slavery from the land.

Again, these "labor strikers"—in principle if not in name—not being satisfied with preventing their "non-unionist" fellow-men from labor, delved into the musty archives of their State and resurrected some obsolete decisions by which they concluded that the county jail was the county workhouse, and succeeded in compelling the very men they had had imprisoned for laboring, to go out in the chain-gang into the public streets and labor. Concerning such acts the Herald says, "Compelling a man to work by any coercion—by a court order or by a taskmaster's lash—is slavery." So it is slavery heaped upon slavery—a condition worse than that previous to the war, the recovery from which latter has just been celebrated with national honors. Which is wisdom: to rescue from ruin, or to foresee and prevent the causes which lead to ruin; prevention or cure?

Finally, "freedom to work or to quit work—the divine right of a man to work, if he wants to work and can get work, and the equally divine right to refuse to work if he is unwilling to work—must be acknowledged as the first principle in any settlement of the immense and important question" of whether a man shall be compelled to work or to refrain from work on Sunday or on any day.
