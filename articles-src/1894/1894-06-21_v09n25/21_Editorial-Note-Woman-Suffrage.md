A WESTERN paper commenting on a request by certain women of Chicago to be appointed sanitary inspectors, says:—

From Congress to city council there is such a cringing to popular favor for votes, that it would be well for the country if the whole brood of demagogues could be thrust aside and independent women of principle substituted.

The idea that official corruption would be reduced by woman suffrage is chimerical and leaves out of the question human nature, which is not essentially different in the sexes. "Man's inhumanity to man" is not greater than woman's inhumanity to woman, which shows that selfishness inheres not to masculinity but to humanity, that is to the race. Woman suffrage is not a panacea for the ills of the body politic.
