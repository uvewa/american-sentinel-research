CITY ATTORNEY HAMILTON, of Milwaukee, Wis., has given an opinion in regard to the taxation of church property which has caused a sensation among churchmen. He says that Archbishop F. X. Katzer must pay taxes on the archiepiscopal residence. The ground on which City Attorney Hamilton bases his opinion is that the property is not used for church purposes, and therefore does not come within the provisions of the exemption law. The opinion must commend itself to all thinking men as sound.
