For several years Mr. Charlton, a member of the Canadian Parliament, has persistently kept before that body a Sunday bill. His bill, modified somewhat, is again up for discussion, and in moving its second reading on the 2nd of May, Mr. Charlton said:—

Now, this bill, Mr. Speaker, is based, of course, upon religious considerations. The Sabbath was set apart in the first place to commemorate the creation of the world; it was set apart by the Creator and hallowed by him. The only institutions, the only blessings that were transmitted to posterity as part of the wreck of man's first estate were the Sabbath and marriage, and when the time came to inaugurate a greater event than the creation of the world, when the time came to redeem man, the hallowed day was changed from the seventh day of the week to the first and re-established as a memorial of redemption. And thus it stands to-day recognized by nearly all Christian churches—recognized by the Catholic Church, recognized by almost every Protestant church—as the day set apart by Divinity to celebrate that great event, the greatest of all events in human history. Now, Mr. Speaker, I propose to present this bill not from the religious standpoint except incidentally. I propose to present this bill and urge its claim upon the members of this house from a civil standpoint. I propose to present this bill as a civil measure; as a measure designed to secure for the people of this country their civil rights, and their religious rights as well, under the law.

All human law rests upon the Decalogue: Thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor; thou shalt not commit adultery—these are the foundations of civil law. And the Decalogue, Mr. Speaker, is not a partial obligation—it is a symmetrical whole; and the State cannot observe part of the Decalogue and disregard part of the Decalogue. If it gives heed to the sixth or the seventh or the eighth commandment, it must give heed also to the fourth, which is a part of the symmetrical whole. Now, although there is no union of Church and State in this country, there is, nevertheless, some intimate connection between the civil institutions of the country and religious obligations. No State can be entirely divorced in its laws and usages and constitutions from this obligation. So, sir, we are bound, in the consideration of this question, to give the requirements of the higher, the divine law, due consideration. We are bound to permit these requirements to have their due weight and to determine what bearing they have upon our civilization and to what extent we are meeting these requirements.

I may be permitted to say, or rather it may be necessary to say a few words with respect to the change from the seventh day of the week to the first day of the week. I judge this is necessary from the fact that last year one of the leading newspapers of this city contained an editorial, in which it combatted the position that the law with respect to Sabbath rest had any application now, or if it had any application it referred to Saturday and not to the first day of the week, and an honorable friend, who sits behind me, took the same ground, that we were arguing for the enactment of a law requiring the observance of a day for the observance of which there was no sanction or requirement in the divine law. I do not think it is necessary to enter into a learned disquisition on this point. Suffice it to say that the Catholic Church has accepted the first day of the week as the Lord's day, and the Protestants have accepted it, with one or two trifling exceptions, and the change of the day is held to rest upon the example of the early Apostolic Church. I desire to refer to certain Catholic authorities. I take the liberty of reading what the holy father, Pope Leo XIII, said about this matter. His holiness said:—

"The observance of the sacred day which was willed expressly by God from the first origin of man, is imperatively demanded by the absolute and essential dependence of the creature upon the Creator. And this law, mark it well, my beloved, which at one and the same time so admirably provides for the honor of God, the spiritual needs and dignity of the man, and the temporal well-being of human life; this law, we say, touches not only individuals, but also people and nations, which owe to divine Providence the enjoyment of every benefit and advantage which is derived from civil society. And it is precisely to this fatal tendency, which to-day prevails to desire to lead mankind away from God, and to order the affairs of kingdoms and nations as if God did not exist, that to-day is to be attributed this contempt and neglect of the day of the Lord. They say, it is true that they intend in this way to promote industry more actively, and to procure for the people an increase of prosperity and riches. Foolish and lying words! They mean, on the contrary, to take away from the people the comforts, the consolations and the benefits of religion; they wish to weaken in them the sentiment of faith and love for heavenly blessings; and they invoke upon the nations the most tremendous scourges of God, the just avenger of his outraged honor."

These are the words of the head of the Catholic Church. These are weighty words, these are words of wisdom, these are words that every man, whether Catholic or Protestant, in this Dominion may well heed, these are words directly warranting the action proposed on this occasion, to ask by legislative enactment to some extent the honoring of this day for which his holiness speaks. I have here expressions on the same line from his eminence Cardinal Taschereau, from his grace Archbishop Fabre, from his eminence Cardinal McCloskey, from Cardinal Gibbons, from Archbishop Ireland, from Archbishop Goodson, from Archbishop Hoss, from Bishop Keene, of Richmond, Va., from the bishop of Buffalo. All these Catholic prelates take exactly the same position (some of them in a more pronounced way) that is taken by the head of their church. As to the Protestant clergy, it is unnecessary to quote from them; it is only necessary to say that all are in favor of legislation that will secure a better observance of this day for the public benefit and for the civil government of man.

It is thus that Mr. Charlton presents his Sunday bill from a "civil standpoint." Of course he indulged in the usual platitudes concerning the "civil benefits" to be derived from Sunday observance, but as a whole his speech was religious; and why not? for he told the simple truth when he said, "This bill, Mr. Speaker, is based, of course, upon religious considerations." No Sunday law was ever based on anything else. This Dominion Sunday bill is simply like its fellows,—for the benefit of the prevailing religion.
