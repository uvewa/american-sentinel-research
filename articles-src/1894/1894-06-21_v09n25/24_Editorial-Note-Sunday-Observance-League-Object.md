IN connection with the meeting referred to in the preceding paragraph, Chairman Heap explained the object of the International Sunday Observance League, as follows:—

The object of this league is to promote a more general and thorough observance of the law of God, as laid down in his fourth commandment; to the end that the desecration of the Christian Sabbath day, by unnecessary labor and amusements, may be suppressed; that man may rest and be refreshed in body, mind, and soul; to maintain good morals, and the peace and good order of society, and with this end in view, to establish State, provincial and local organizations, whose objects and purposes shall be to coöperate in the enactment and enforcement of laws for the suppression of all violations of the Sabbath day, and to promote the highest and truest patriotism toward God, our country, and the world.

The work of this league is intended to embrace all objects pertaining to good government, including, among other things, the election of persons of good moral character to public office.

In other words, the object of the league is to use the civil law to compel men to serve God.
