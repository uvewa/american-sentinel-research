[The following was sent to the Citizen, an A. P. A. paper published in Boston, but it was declined. The writer asks that it be published in the AMERICAN SENTINEL, which not being an A. P. A. organ, is as ready to unite papacy masquerading under the name of Protestantism as when labeled "Romanism." It is the principle that is to be condemned and opposed, not any particular embodiment of that principle.]

## To the Editor of the Citizen:

THE writer of these lines is a staunch A. P. A. My hands are the calloused ones of the hard-working man. They are more used to the hammer than to the pen. And if, once in my life, I leave the former for the latter, it is because those who are better qualified keep still.

As for me, I can no longer be silent. Week after week I have watched the columns of the Citizen to see if somebody would not sound the note of alarm. But in vain! If nobody else will speak the truth, I shall.

That simple, burning, shameful truth is this: there is a conspiracy in the camp; the gates are secretly opened by our friends to let the enemy in; there are Protestant Romanists even in the A. P. A.

The most lamentable part of it is that this enemy is so closely related to us, so self-deceived as to disarm antagonism. If I should point him out now, many I fear would not recognize him. They would be horrified and indignant if I should name this foe of liberty.

To the deceived ones and to those who are sleeping on guard, I say: In the name of liberty and country, listen to me for a few moments and then judge for yourselves!

What is the A. P. A.?

Its object, says our platform, is "to keep the pope of Rome and his emissaries from interfering" with our Government.

We are willing and glad to grant "all religious equal rights;" to allow all Catholics to remain such in all freedom.

We are "not against Roman Catholics as a Christian body." They may take their religion from the pope or the fathers or the heathen to their hearts' content; but we are, and tremendously, against, their taking their politics from Rome and practicing it on our Government.

And why?—Because Rome's fundamental article of politics is "the right of perpetuating the union of Church and State;" the right not "to leave every man free to profess and embrace whatever religion he may deem true;" "the right to require that the Catholic religion shall be the only religion of the State, to the exclusion of all others;" "the power of requiring the State not to permit free expression of opinion."

And yet this is the very state of things which many "Protestants" are trying to introduce—a union of Church and State—a governmental religion! What have we to do with Rome until we have cleaned the camp from such traitors?

Now I want you to be able to recognize this angel-faced monster when you see him. It strikes at the very root—just as much as the foreign potentate on the Tiber—at the very root of our dearest, immortal, American principles, which every A. P. A. is sworn to defend.

What are these principles?

A. P. A. PLATFORM.

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.—U. S. Constitution.

Every man who conducts himself as a good citizen is accountable to God alone for his religious faith, and should be protected in worshiping God according to the dictates of his own conscience.—George Washington.

Religion is not in the purview of human government. Religion is essentially distinct and exempt from its cognizance; a connection between them is injurious to both.—James Madison.

It is impossible for the magistrate to adjudge the right of preference among the various sects that profess the Christian faith without creating a claim to infallibility, which would lead us back to the Church of Rome. . . . Distant as it may be in its present form from the Inquisition, it differs from it only in degree. The one is the first step, the other is the last in the career of intolerance.—Thomas Jefferson.

Keep the Church and the State forever separate.—U. S. Grant.

(The Constitution of the United States does not delegate to Congress any power) to inquire what part of time or whether any has been made holy by the Almighty. . . . If a solemn act of legislation shall in one point define the law of God, or point out to the citizen one religious duty, it may, with equal propriety, define every part of revelation and enforce every religious obligation even to the forms and ceremonies of worship.—U. S. Senate Report, 1836.

Will the Protestant ministers in general wake up from their lethargy before it is too late, or will they continue to work hand in hand with the Protestant National Reform Association and with the Romans, to establish a national religion, . . . or will they, like true spiritual advisers, join the A. P. A. in the good work?—A. P. A. tract, Read and Reflect, No. 2, revised edition, p. 11.

Such is the simple, lucid, immortal platform of the A. P. A. Let us see to it, if we want to prevent a shameful defeat, that it be not perverted, and that every one who does not subscribe to it be regarded and rejected as a foe, even if he be a "Protestant" minister.

Now I can tell you who the foe is; our official platform has just named it, it is the National Reform Association, and with it, to the extent they hold the same principles, the American Sabbath Union, the Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and, taken as bodies, almost every Protestant denomination in the land.

Here is the proof of it. Read the platform of the National Reform Association:—

To secure such an amendment to the Constitution of the United States as will declare the nation's allegiance to Jesus Christ, and its acceptance of the moral laws of the Christian religion, and so indicate that this is a Christian nation, and place all the Christian laws, institutions, and usages of our Government on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land.—Art. 2. National Reform Constitution.

Our remedy for all these malefic influences is to have the Government simply set up the moral law, and recognize God's authority behind it, and lay its hand on any religion that does not conform to it.—Christian Statesman, Jan. 13, 1887.

Let those who will, remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy from motives of love and obedience; the remnant must be made to do so through fear of law.—Christian Nation, Sept. 1887.

All this is sound Romanism and nothing else.

Now read the platform of the American Sabbath Union:—

The basis of this union is the divine authority and universal and perpetual obligation of the Sabbath, as . . . formulated in the fourth commandment of the moral law.—Constitution, Art. II.

The American Sabbath Union, while recognizing the value of arguments for the Sabbath from expediency and physical health, still regards as its chief work the quickening of the Christian conscience upon the subject.—Annual Meeting of 1888, resolution II.

In view of the neglect to enforce Sunday laws . . . it has become an imperative necessity that Christians should insist that the officers of the law perform their duty.—Resolution V.

We indorse the petitions for the passage of a National Rest Bill.—Resolution VI.

That also is rank popery under a Protestant garb; enforcing by law an act of worship, a matter of conscience.

Now read the platform of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union:—

The Woman's Christian Temperance Union, local, State, national, and world-wide, has one vital, organic thought, one all-absorbing purpose, one underlying enthusiasm, and that is that Christ shall be this world's King. . . . The kingdom of Christ must enter the realm of law through the gateway of politics.—Convention of 1887.

A true theocracy is yet to come.—W. C. T. U. Monthly Reading for September 1886.

This also is as un-American and fanatical as it is antichristian and Jesuitical.

Read now also the platform of the League for the Protection of American Institutions.

The League for the Protection of American Institutions (a veritable twin-sister of the A. P. A.) which is the originator and the promoter of the proposed Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution, is another ingenious, hypocritical scheme to provide for the teaching of "the principles of the Christian religion" in our public schools. The two leading organizers and champions James M. King, D.D., and John Jay, now deceased, both publicly committed themselves to the doctrine of a State religion, and of enforcing by law "the Christianity of the Bible"(?).

The Evangelical Alliance finally, which is the representative, authoritative spokesman for Protestantism all over the globe, a sort of Protestant Ecumenical Council, did, on the 13th of February 1889, through its representative, the same James M. King, D.D., commit itself publicly in favor of the Blair Amendment to the Constitution, providing for the teaching of "the principles of the Christian religion in the public schools."

Such are the platforms of the so-called "Protestant" church and State leagues, and associations. Is there anything more un-American, more liberty destroying, more papal, and at the same time more plausible and deceitful in any of the Bulls of Gregory VII. or Innocent III.? And yet such are the satanic doctrines taught and diffused throughout the country by these excellent, pious,—many of them,—and sincere, but exceedingly deceived, distorted, intolerant, and bigoted Protestant Romanists.

Let me repeat that the A. P. A. platform squarely denounces all these subtle, would-be Christian methods of Romanizing the country, when it warns "the Protestant ministers in general" against "working hand in hand with the Protestant National Reform Association and with the Romans, to establish a national religion," and when it says that "all sectarian and religious teaching therein [in the public schools] should be positively prohibited."

That being the case, I lift a voice of warning and solemn protest against our accepting as square and fair A. P. A's any man who is in any way, shape, or manner connected with these malefic and mistaken religious orders or societies. I go further: I predict that, unless we stick to our platform and refuse to initiate any who do not intelligently subscribe to all its principles and renounce contrary principles, the A. P. A. will either die of woeful assassination, or else that a split will take place sooner or later, both of which alternatives are lamentable beyond expression, because our country, our lives, and our homes are at stake.

And now, before I close, just a few words as to what has been done by the Protestant Church and State conspiracy toward creating an American Protestant papacy.

They have succeeded in getting the United States Supreme Court to declare, February 29, 1892, that "Christianity is the law of the land," that "this is a Christian nation." And since that, the Catholic Church, in its Catholic Congress at the World's Fair, says this is a "Catholic Christian nation"!

They have succeeded, after many defeated attempts, in passing safely through Congress in 1892 also, the thin edge of the wedge, the infamous precedent of religious legislation—for the first time since 1776—under the form of the Sunday closing law about the World's Fair. The law was signed by Benjamin Harrison, President of the United States of America, August 5, 1892.

And since that the Catholic Church, through the organs of Archbishop Ireland and Cardinal Gibbons, boasts that "Church and State, have been united for its own benefit and preparatory to its coming triumph."

This treason completed, the Constitution mutilated, Church and State united, liberty stabbed to the heart; Rev. J. D. Sands tells us that "the Church has weight with great political governing bodies," that "the United States Senate, the highest body in the country, listened to the voice of religion and passed the World's Fair $5,000,000 appropriation bill with the church-instituted proviso;" and Rev. H. H. George, D.D. exclaims: "I have learned that we hold the United States Senate in our hands." "We can hold Congress in our hands, and wield this country just as we please."

And now Romanism, beaming all over with an infernal grin, sees its way all cleared and paved toward the complete destruction of liberty and its own total supremacy for another thousand years of moral midnight.

And who is it that indorsed and joined the American Sabbath Union and the National Reform Association in petitioning Congress in 1892 for the passing of that pious and murderous bill on religion? Listen: the Presbyterians, the Episcopalians, the Congregationalists, the Methodists, the Baptists, the Disciples, the Second [Sunday-keeping] Adventists, etc. How did they do it? Answer: Officially, in bodies, at their general meetings.

More than all this, as Jefferson predicted it, the machine of Church and State has again been put into operation. A Protestant Inquisition has been inaugurated. For the last few years, until this very day, honest, conscientious people, who keep Saturday and of course work on Sunday, have been on that account molested, prosecuted, persecuted, fined, tyrannized over, yes, imprisoned from thirty to sixty and ninety days; yea, more, marched in the chain-gang with highway robbers.

Ask the jails of Arkansas, Tennessee, Georgia, Maryland and they will tell you. Read the documents published by the National Religious Liberty Association and you will see if it is not time to protect our American institutions against papal Protestants first, and against papal Romanists next, or rather against both all the time, and if it is not time to make sure that every A. P. A. is an enlightened patriot, and not a traitor, an imbecile, or a jewel of inconsistency, and a parody on common sense.

Yours for a free America, and for a consistent and triumphant American Protective Association.

W. H. SEAMAN.

P. S.—There is at this writing three Protestant religious bills before Congress: one for the recognition of God, Jesus Christ, and the Bible in the Constitution; one for the enforcement of the "Lord's day" as "a day of rest and worship" in the District of Columbia, and one general Sunday law. The first two were introduced in Congress by "Hon." Elijah Morse of Massachusetts. And now, Monsignor Satolli, take your turn for the catechism, and Saint Joseph! S.
