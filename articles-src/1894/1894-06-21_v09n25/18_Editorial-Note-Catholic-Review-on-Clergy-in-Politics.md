THE Catholic Review has the following caustic editorial note, which, owing to the inconsistencies of professed Protestants, is not without force:—

Some of our neighbors are constantly chattering about the dangers of a union of Church and State, "the encroachments of Romanism," clerical influence in politics, etc., yet clergymen of theirs are constantly seeking public office, and they make no protest. Here, for instance, is the Rev. Alexander Mackay Smith, of Washington, D. C., who has secured the appointment of himself as member of the Board of Visitors to the United States Military Academy at West Point. What has a preacher, as such, to do with war or the martial training of soldiers? Taking advantage of his expenses-paid visit to West Point as a civil official, he had the cadets corraled in the so-called cathedral there and preached to them a sermon intended to be religious. Now, where is the National League for the Protection of American Institutions? Where? Why, looking in the lobby of the Constitutional Convention lying about the Catholics.

We are not so sure about the latter count in the indictment. There is certainly no occasion to lie about Catholics: the truth is bad enough; but so-called Protestants can not consistently demand that papists shall, as such, let civil matters alone until they set the example.
