THE NEW YORK Sun, of June 13, contains the following paragraphs of telegraphic news:—

ORANGE, N. J., June 12.—Since the revival of the Blue Laws, Millburn has been an unusually quiet village on Sunday. To all appearances their is no liquor sold, and persons who fail to get their cigars and similar luxuries on Saturday are obliged to resort to strategy to purchase them on Sunday. It is rumored that an attempt may be made to prohibit bicycle riding and carriage driving on Sunday. Donato Russo, the owner of the fruit and confectionery store on Millburn Avenue, who was arrested four times on Sunday, May 28, for conducting business on that day, after being warned by the police to close his place, caused surprise in the township yesterday by entering a complaint before Justice Dean of Newark, against Oliver Bonnell and Jacob Waetcher, butchers, and John Pullman and F. Livingstone, barbers, whom Russo charged with conducting business on Sunday last.

Bonnell and Waetcher appeared before Justice Dean, who fined each $2 and costs, and warned them not to open their stores on Sundays. The matter is the chief topic of conversation in the village, and many opinions are expressed regarding the outcome of the Township Committee's expressed intention of causing the discontinuance of "unnecessary business" on Sunday. The committee had allowed the butchers to conduct their business until 8 A. M. on Sundays, and found no fault with barbers attending to their professional duties, although they warned the latter not to offer cigars and tobacco for sale.

CHICAGO, June 10.—The city council last night voted to stop merchandising on Sunday. Only the signature of Mayor Hopkins and the enforcement of the measure by the Police Department are necessary to secure for the Sunday Rest Association and for the bodies of organized labor in Chicago the essential points for which they have been contending. In substance the ordinance provides that:—

"No person, firm company, or corporation, either as principal, agent, officer, employé, clerk, servant, or workman, shall keep open for business within the city of Chicago any store or place for the purpose of selling or exposing for sale or selling any clothes, dry goods, hats, caps, furnishing goods, jewelry, boots, shoes, hardware, furniture, meats, or groceries, or any one or more of said articles, on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday; also that no barber shop shall be allowed to remain open and do business after 10 o'clock Sunday morning."

The ordinance allows the sale of meats and groceries up to 10 o'clock on Sunday mornings during the months of June, July, August and September.

Such paragraphs as these, now so frequently to be found in the public prints, mark the startling advancement of the iniquity of prosecution for the enforcement of antiquated religious laws, and the increasing success of the persistent movement to secure more religious laws, of greater stringency, both national, State, and municipal. If it were possible to obtain accurate statistics of legislation on religious subjects, and enforcement of religious laws, in all the world, for the last five years, the evidence of the surprising growth of this wickedness in the name of religion would shock every true Christian, and alarm every intelligent citizen, not only in this country, but throughout the world.

It is not in the United States alone that this strange revival of mediaevalism has taken place, but there is scarce a country of the earth however high its state of civilization or however great its lack of civilization, in which the influence of these Satan-inspired measures for the antagonism of true religion is not now making itself felt in greater or less degree.

No means ever tried by the enemy of mankind for the destruction of man has been more successful than this subtle delusion by which he leads men to attempt the enforcement of religion by civil law. Persecution will result from the resurrection of this colossal error, but those upon whose heads the destruction will eventually and inevitably fall will not be the subjects of persecution but the persecutors.

W. H. McKEE.
