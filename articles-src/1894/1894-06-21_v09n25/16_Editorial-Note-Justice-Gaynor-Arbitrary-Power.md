IN discharging a man a few days since, arrested for horse racing, Justice Gaynor, of the New York Supreme Court, said: "The arrest was an exercise of arbitrary power, and history teaches that we have more to fear from arbitrary power than from all species of gambling combined." Justice Gaynor's words should be pondered by the Sunday law bigots.
