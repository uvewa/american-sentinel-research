TUESDAY, May 15, a "mass" meeting was held in Chicago in the interests of so-called Sabbath observance. The meeting was held in the People's Institute, and the speakers "were prominent churchmen and workers in social reform movements." The audience was made up of the friends of enforced Sunday observance. "The meeting," says the Inter-Ocean, "was an unusually enthusiastic one. Its purpose to arouse a sentiment in favor of a holy Sunday was fully realized." The meeting was held under the auspices of the international Sunday Observance League. And "the speeches," says the Inter-Ocean, "were thoroughly practical. There was no theorizing. The main plea was for an enforcement of the present laws."
