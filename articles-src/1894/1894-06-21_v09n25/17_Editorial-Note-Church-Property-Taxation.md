THE Northwestern Christian Advocate has this to say about the exemption of church property from taxation:—

In the wiser day coming, every dollar of church personal value and every foot of church land will pay taxes to support honest secular government. Remission of taxes for church and church school uses is a secular gift to churches.

True enough, but could the Advocate ever have seen the point had not the Roman Catholic Church been by far the largest beneficiary from such secular gifts?
