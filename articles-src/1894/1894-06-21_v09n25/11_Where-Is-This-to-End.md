"The fact," says an exchange, "that 53,000 organized Catholic laymen marched in the great procession in Chicago which celebrated the opening of the World's Fair, while not a single Protestant Church in the land was represented as an organized body, has not only set the latter to thinking but seems to have inspired a movement in Protestants churches and in public and private schools for the organization of boys' brigades."

Has it indeed come to this that the churches of our land are dependent in any degree on such organizations to maintain their influence on the rising generation? If so, God pity them; for the end of such a state of affairs can be nothing but bloodshed.
