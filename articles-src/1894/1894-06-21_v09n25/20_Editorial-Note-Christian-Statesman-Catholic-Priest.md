THE Christian Statesman, which some months since declared that "the most powerful organized enemy, civil and religious liberty has ever contended against, is the papacy," notes in its issue of June 9, with evident satisfaction, the fact that a recent "mass meeting," in the interests of Sunday sacredness, held at Stevens Point, Wis., under the auspices of the American Sabbath Union, was addressed by a Catholic priest. "The mayor of the town was upon the platform, and strong resolutions were passed urging him and the council to enforce the Sabbath laws."
