THE Catholic Review of this city suggests that—

Wherever there is a public library, the Catholics of the neighborhood should combine to raise a fund to contribute, say, one hundred first-class Catholic books to it. If they don't do this, they will lose a great chance to spread knowledge of the truth. Is there such an opportunity where you live?

Protestants ought to see to it that every library is likewise supplied with anti-Catholic literature.
