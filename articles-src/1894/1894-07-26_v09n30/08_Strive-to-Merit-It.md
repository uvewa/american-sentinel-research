The Hon. James T. Ringgold, of the Baltimore bar, is well known to our readers, and by them held in high and grateful esteem for his noble defense of the principles of religious freedom and civil equality. Mr. Ringgold has written a book on the "Legal Sunday," which will form a number of the Religious Liberty Library very soon to be issued. The author dedicates the forthcoming volume to Seventh-day Adventists in the following highly appreciative language:—

### TO MY FRIENDS,

The members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church throughout the world: Those true representatives of the martyrs of old, inheriting their spirit, tasting somewhat of their experiences; persecuted for religion's sake in "free" and "Christian" America, as were their prototypes in despotic and pagan Rome; like them hesitating not in the choice between "Diana and Christ;" yet, when reviled, revilling not again; may they yet, like them, make history; and by their firmness, their patience, above all by the example of their pure and beautiful lives, bring about the abandonment of pagan practices and pagan modes of thought in all Christian lands. To you, Seventh-day Adventists, this work is dedicated with the assurance that this world can offer no greater reward of endeavor, no higher honor for the writer, than the privilege of calling you, "My Friends."

The expression of such sentiments, and their application to our people, imposes a sacred obligation to fulfill the position thus assigned to us. To appropriate unmerited praise is no credit to any one. To accept such lofty appreciation and make no effort to support the character ascribed to us would be a disgrace. God knows us better than Mr. Ringgold does. He in his providence has called us to stand in the very position outlined. Let us humbly strive with the help of divine grace to merit this eulogy, not only from those who know us among men, but from Him who sees not as man sees.—Review and Herald, S. D. Adventist Church paper.
