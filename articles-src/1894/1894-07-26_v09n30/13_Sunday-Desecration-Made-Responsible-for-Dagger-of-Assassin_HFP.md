THE Christian Statesman of July 7, attempts to place the responsibility of the work of the assassin, in the case of President Carnot, upon Sunday desecration in France. But in the attempt it has completely stultified its own position. The Statesman says: "For a hundred years the French nation has been in open defiance of the law of God, which commands 'Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.' . . . But the Sabbath is the one unfailing, open witness of the Almighty. It is a witness set in the heavens, and when observed, testifies to the authority of Jehovah with the clearness and constancy of the shining sun.

"The French people have been playing the anarchist toward the Almighty for one hundred years. They have stabbed righteousness to the heart every seventh day and defied God to avenge the dishonor of crime." And then, with a wonderful amount of seeming modesty, the Statesman continues: We do not like to attempt to interpret Providence, but if the Almighty should desire to testify against this wickedness and defiance of his law and manifest his wrath was there a more opportune time than that in which the blow of the assassin fell?" But how is this? Does the reader see the relation between the fourth commandment and the blow of the assassin? Here it is: "There is one thing in connection with the time and circumstances of his death which deeply impressed us, but which we have not seen referred to, viz., that he was assassinated on the Sabbath [Sunday] at the close of a day of feasting and public demonstration, and while he was on his way to the theater to witness a performance." All of which is to say that because the French people have not regarded Sunday—of course it means Sunday, although it says seventh day—with that Puritanical strictness that the Statesman thinks to be necessary; yet—(and the Statesman would be very modest in the interpretation of Providence)—yet Providence(?) directed the matter in such a way so that the blow of the assassin fell at that particular hour on Sunday!! Was ever absurdity more absurd? It is even worse;—it is open blasphemy to thus attribute the work of the assassin to Providence.

But with all due charity I will indulge the fond hope that the Christian Statesman did not mean all that the words imply. Yet it is a fact that men are driven in their blindness to a false cause, to make just such mistakes.
