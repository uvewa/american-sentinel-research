The times smack of religious tumult. Two moderators of the Presbyterian Assembly—those of Sydney and Brisbane—have been publicly accused of doctrines hateful to the church. Nearer home a brutal and licentious soldiery have dared to perform "equestrian exercises" on the Lord's day. Finally a judge of the Supreme Court has confessed without shame that he read up the Speight vs. Syme case on the Sunday afternoon. Well may Mr. James Balfour and Professor Rentoul, in the pauses of the Miss Sutherland controversy find time to wonder how it is that earthquakes are smiting Athens when the real offenders are nearer at hand. However, no less pious a monarch than the second Charles has provided against the emergency, and already two Seventh-day Adventists have been sentenced to imprisonment in the stocks. These gentlemen insist on holding their Sabbath on the Saturday, and claim the right, having fulfilled their obligations to Providence, to follow their lawful calling on the Sunday. They must be taught the necessity of observing two Sabbaths in the week.

In the days when Charles the Second ruled the glorious British nation,

It is said, from paths of virtue he habitually swerved;

That he spent his whole existence in repulsive dissipation—

But at least he took precaution that the Sabbath was observed.

He was prone, perhaps, to covet the possessions of his neighbors.

Or his neighbor's wife or daughter, or his servant, or his ox;

But he held decided views upon the point of Sunday labor,

And he punished all transgressors by confinement in the stocks.

Let us cherish the remembrance of a prince so truly pious,

And condone his little pleasures as the follies of a king,

Close our eyelids to his vices, let them pass unheeded by us,

Though in ordinary mortals it would be a different thing.

Let us recognize his claim to take a prominent position in the calendar devoted to the saintly orthodox,

And insert a special heading in the Sunday school petition,

"May God bless Charles the Second, and may Heaven preserve the stocks."

Let us all become detectives, down on Sabbath desecration,

Let us catch the bold offenders in the very act of crime,

That the stocks may never suffer from the lack of occupation,

And the prison and the pillory be going all the time.

And when we we find a citizen who tries the Sunday watering,

Of his twenty feet of grass plot or his bed of holly-hocks—

Well, we can't resort to hanging, or to drawing, or to quartering.

But all praise to Charles the Second, we can put him in the stocks.

—The Aryus, Melbourne, Australia, May 12.
