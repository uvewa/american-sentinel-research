COMMENTING on the fact that England is slowly but surely being converted to the true faith, the London correspondent of the Drogheda Argus says: "The truth is that at the present moment Catholicity in England, so far from being banned and scoffed at, is becoming fashionable, and to the Cardinal-Archbishop of Westminster is conceded a rank and a precedence, even in the presence of royalty, which are both striking and gratifying. Then, again, we have the convert Lord Ripon, a member of the queen's cabinet and filling the office of one of the great secretaries of State; and my conviction is that only for the band of bigots at present in the two Houses of Parliament, an act opening the Lord Chancellorship of England to a Catholic would be passed without murmur; and furthermore, that the English people would be well content to see the English woolsack occupied by the eminent Catholic lawyer, Sir Charles Russell."—The Monitor.
