AFTER the Sunday-car agitation in Toronto, Canada, last summer, a Mr. Kelly started Sunday 'buses. He has about eight at present. It grieves the Sunday people greatly, and it has been all Sunday preachers could endure to see such "desecration" continue. The law was not invoked until recently, but now the matter is in the courts, and the Sunday people are doing all in their power to restrict the movement of the people on the first day of the week. Those who do not own carriages, and are not able to hire them, can go to church or else stay at home.
