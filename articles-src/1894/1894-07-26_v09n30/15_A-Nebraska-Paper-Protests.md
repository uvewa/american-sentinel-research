EVERY little while there is a threat of returning to the practical union of Church and State in this country. Any one who has even a superficial knowledge of religious history knows that wherever religion and politics have been united, wherever Church and State have been at one, there has been tyranny. There never has been a case in the history of the world where religion had the power to use the arm of the State that it did not use it, and use it against the rights and liberties of those who did not agree with them in their religious opinions. There never has been one single case. Only a little while ago a man in one of the Southern States was in prison. He was a Seventh-day Baptist. He believed in observing the Sabbath as he is ordered to in the Bible. His neighbors believed in keeping the first day; and there is a nefarious law on their statute book making it a crime for a man to work on the first day of the week. This man having kept the seventh day as his Bible told him to, and not feeling under any obligation to keep two days—the same Bible commanding him to labor six days—went about his business on the first day of the week, and was arrested and imprisoned. The only safety for liberty is the utter separation of Church and State. Yet every little while there is a bill introduced into Congress to attempt to put the name of God into the Constitution, and to declare officially in our fundamental law that we are a Christian people; and this right in the face of the fact that, were the orthodox God and the orthodox interpretation of Christianity to get into the Constitution of the United States, the rights of man would go out in the downfall of pure republican government and the establishment of an hierarchal government, and that it would then be necessary for the freemen to arise in their might, demolish the oligarchy and hurl the traitors into oblivion, at whatever cost.—The Sentinel, Oakdale, Nebraska.
