Christ was the true light; he let his light shine through his life, his teachings and his works; instance, John 5:2-9, the healing of the impotent man at the pool of Bethesda on the Sabbath. The Sabbath is the memorial of creative power. Ex. 20:11. Christ used that same power in healing the sick; his course was in entire harmony with the spirit of the Sabbath of the Lord, but not with that of the Pharissical Sabbath. Bearing burdens was violating one of the forty primary works forbidden of the Jews on their Sabbath. That day which God designed should be a blessing and a delight, Isa. 58:13, the Pharisees had made almost unbearable by their heavy burdens and senseless exactions. They must not tread on green grass on the Sabbath, because that "crushed" something; and numberless other things just as absurd must be avoided.

The Jews were aware that their temple had been destroyed and they had been carried captives to Babylon because they had not kept the Sabbath. Lev. 26:31-35; 2 Chron. 36:21. Now they were fearful of a like-calamity, and the least semblance of work could not be tolerated; yet here was Jesus disregarding their plainest, most positive, rules of Sabbath-keeping; surely if they let him thus alone all men would believe on him; they would all be guilty of Sabbath breaking, and the Romans would come and take away both their place and nation as Nebuchadneszarl had done before. John 11:48. Jesus kept God's holy Sabbath in God's way. The Sabbath was made for man—to be a blessing to him—and not man for the Sabbath—to be its slave.

"Therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the Sabbath day." John 5:16. Our Saviour answered them: "My Father worketh hitherto and I work." Verse 17. God had never withdrawn his power from operating through the laws of nature, to keep a single Sabbath since the creation of the world. Should divine power, in the force of cohesion, rest from its work, the ultimate atoms of which every body is composed must fall apart; for by him all things hold together (Col. 1:17, R. V., margin), and he is constantly "upholding all things by the word of his power." Heb. 1:3. Should the law of gravitation, which is the power of God, be suspended, what an awful chaos of all the worlds would instantaneously follow! The God of love works unceasingly, in numberless ways, great and small, that the Sabbath may be a season of holy joy and refreshing to us. How important that we understand the true purpose of Sabbath-keeping and that we keep the Sabbath in the way to receive the blessing God put into it. Gen. 2:3. The Pharisees had made the Sabbath as well as other commandments of none effect by their tradition. Matt. 15. Vote is all worship that is not of God's appointment, verse 9; hence Jesus sought to restore the true character of the Sabbath.

Our Saviour's works not only witness to the unchangeable law of God, which is the light, Prov. 6:23, but the works of Christians must do the same. As Jesus let his light shine by his works so says he, "Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works." Matt. 5:16. Christ kept his Father's commandments. John 15:10. And we are so to walk even as he walked. 1 John 2:6.

Those who had been with Christ in his earthly ministry and listened to his teachings did this. After he was laid in the tomb they rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment, and upon the first day of the week they were ready for work again. Luke 23:56; 24:1. Jesus, as his custom was, went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read. Luke 4:16. Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them and three Sabbath days reasoned with them out of the Scriptures. Acts 17:2. His manner was the same with both Jews and Gentiles. See Acts 13:14, 42, 44. Wherever Sabbath-keeping is mentioned from Genesis to Revelation, every one of God's children keep the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. The last generation is no exception. See Rev. 14:12.
