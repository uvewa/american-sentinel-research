A CONTEMPORARY remarks that toleration "is certainly a virtue whose spirit is embodied in the American Constitution." Equality is a better word than toleration, and best expresses the real spirit of the Constitution. We do not "tolerate" Presbyterianism or Roman Catholicism in this country. Both have perfect equality before the law. We tolerate what we may disallow if we choose; so Spain tolerates Protestantism. But religious equality is a right not to be gainsaid; and that is the boast of America, as it is a fundamental principle of the Federal Constitution.—The Christian Work.
