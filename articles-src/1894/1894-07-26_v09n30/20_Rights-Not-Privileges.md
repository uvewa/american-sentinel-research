ONE of the strangest things in human nature is the tendency to accept from government rights as favors, and to be devoutly thankful to government for them. Thus we find a Fourth of July orator near Lincoln, Neb., saying that notwithstanding the fact that our Government "is not as true to the Constitution as it once was," "we should be thankful for what our country has done for us, and for the privileges still granted us." The connection shows that the "privileges" have reference to rights of conscience, to believe and practice according to the dictates of conscience. The man who can be thankful for such privileges "granted" by government, could be thankful if he were about to be hung.

If we may believe the Declaration of Independence, there are such things as inalienable rights; rights not only not conferred by government, but rights of which government has no right to deprive a single man, however humble. Among these are rights of conscience. In 1829, Hon. Richard M. Johnson said, in a report to the United States Senate:—

What other nations call religious toleration, we call religious rights. They are exercised not in virtue of governmental indulgence, but as rights, of which government cannot deprive any portion of citizens.

This is true, but what then becomes of the idea of being thankful to government "for the privileges still granted us"? In 1827 Lord Stanhope said, in the British House of Lords:—

The time was when toleration was craved by dissenters as a boon; it is now demanded as a right; but the time will come when it will be spurned as an insult.

But that time can never come to people who are taught that religious liberty is a privilege granted by government. It is granted by God only, and the government that touches it is a tyranny, whatever its form or by whatever name it may be called.
