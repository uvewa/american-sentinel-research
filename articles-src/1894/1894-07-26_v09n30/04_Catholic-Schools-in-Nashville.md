It has recently been discovered that all of the many Roman Catholic schools in this city have been exempted for more than twenty years from the payment of water taxes, while all the Protestant schools have been required to pay full rates. This is a most astonishing state of affairs, especially in a city which is so thoroughly Protestant as Nashville is. We are glad to see that the Board of Public Works has ordered a change of policy. The true doctrine is that no church ought to ask or receive any favor from the civil government. The church that consents to do so is simply heaping up wrath against the day of wrath. In this same connection we notice the following paragraph: "The authorities in Milwaukee, Wis., have decided that a block of twenty business houses, deeded to the Roman Catholic bishop, must pay taxes like business houses of other people. A similar decision compels the Summerfield Methodist Church, now used as a place of business, to pay taxes. All of which is right."—Nashville Christian Advocate.
