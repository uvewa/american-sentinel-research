COMMENTING upon the assassination of President Carnot, the Christian Reformer pitches savagely into its "dearest foe," secular government. Here is a sample paragraph:—

We have no hesitation in saying that the chief cause of anarchy is secularism in civil government. The nations of the earth set up governments, but not by God. They establish laws and ordinances regardless of, and sometimes in opposition to, the divine law. Civil governments do not appeal to the consciences of their citizens, and call upon them to obey the law in the name of God. Even laws that are good are enforced, not because they are the voice of God, but solely because they are the will of the people. There is no partnership between God and civil government to-day, and, as a consequence, we have reared a generation who fear neither God nor government.

Is it true that there is no union of the religious and civil in government to-day? The president of France was assassinated, and France officially pays annually a vast sum for the support of religion. There are many Freethinkers in France, but France is not yet a secular republic. The "partnership between God and civil government" remains, for "God" can form a partnership with government at secondhand only, the priests being his proxies. Alexander of Russia died by the bomb of the assassin, and in Russia Church and State are one. The partnership aforesaid is complete. What the Christian Reformer means is, of course, perfectly clear. It means that there is no avowed partnership between the Covenanters and civil government. Partnership with Catholic or Greek Christians or non-Presbyterian Protestants is no defense against the lightnings of divine wrath. Of course there were no riots, no assassinations of rulers, no revolutions in the ages when all believed that kings, as kings, received their credentials directly from the bureau of God's prime minister, signed by the hand of the Supreme. The Reformer is under the necessity of ignoring all history and all current events but such as by the most strained and fanciful interpretation can be forced to adorn its lugubrious tale.

The theocratic organ makes all it can of the fact that Carnot was murdered on Sunday while on his way to the theater, after attending a banquet in his honor. He had also gone to Lyons to visit an exposition which was open on Sunday. Could any thing be plainer? . . . The Christian Reformer sticks remorselessly to its text, concluding its jeremiad in these words:—

Is there not a close connection between such an open disregard of the law of the Sabbath, such a public insult to the government of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the development of the spirit of anarchy? If civil government refuses to acknowledge divine authority and law, if civil magistrates publicly trample upon divine commands, we may expect to produce a race of anarchists who fear neither divine nor human government. What, then, is the remedy? Banish the whole secular idea from political life. Let religion have its proper place in the public schools, and in all national institutions. Let laws be enacted and enforced avowedly in the name and by the authority of Almighty God and the mediatorial ruler, the Lord Jesus Christ. Let the constitutions of civil government be framed in accordance with the revealed principles of government. Then, and only then, will the nations be free from the danger of anarchy and experience the blessedness of the nation whose God is the Lord.

There you have the programme of the theocrats without the slightest attempt to qualify their demands. Church and State are to be one and that one the Church. This scheme enables them to say with apparent respect for the truth that they are opposed to the union of State and Church. They are. It is not union of two equal powers that they wish, but the fusing of them into an indivisible oneness, the State being absorbed by and into the Church and the resulting theocracy taking the place of both the secular civil State and of the churches, the latter hitherto depending largely upon their own resources, but hereafter to be sustained by the political arm of the new amalgamated church.—Truth Seeker.
