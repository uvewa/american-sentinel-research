"From a child thou hast known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works." 2 Tim. 3:15-17. "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them." Isa. 8:20.

The challenge of the Roman Catholic Church, from which I quote representative paragraphs, formed the four leading editorials which appeared in the Catholic Mirror of Baltimore, Md., September 2, 9, 16, and 23, 1893. The Catholic Mirror is the official organ of Cardinal Gibbons, who is at the head of the Catholic Church in this country. The challenge has since been printed in pamphlet form by the Catholic Mirror, and republished by the Religious Liberty Association and Pacific Press Publishing Company, and millions of copies have been circulated all over this country, in Europe, in South Africa, and Australia. The title and a few of the most striking paragraphs from the Mirror pamphlet, are as follows:—

"The Christian Sabbath, The Genuine Offspring of the Union of the Holy Spirit and the Catholic Church, His Spouse. The claims of Protestantism to any Part Therein, Proved to be Groundless, Self-Contradictory and Suicidal."

The Israelite respects the authority of the Old Testament only, but the Adventist, who is a Christian, accepts the New Testament on the same ground as the "Old, viz.: an inspired record also. He finds that the Bible, his teacher, is consistent in both parts; that the Redeemer, during his mortal life, never kept any other day than Saturday. The Gospels plainly evince to him this fact; whilst, in the pages of the Acts of the Apostles, the Epistles and the Apocalyper, not the vestige of an act cancelling the Saturday arrangement can be found. The Adventists, therefore, in common with the Israelites, derive their belief from the Old Testament, which position is confirmed by the New Testament, indorsing fully by the life and practice of the Redeemer and his Apostles the teaching of the Sacred Word for nearly a century of the Christian era.

As the Catholic yields his judgment in spiritual matters implicitly and with unreceived confidence, to the voice of his church, so too, the Protestant recognizes no teacher but the Bible.

Hence, the conclusion is inevitable: viz., that of those who follow the Bible as their guide, the Israelites and Seventh-day Adventists, have the exclusive weight of evidence on their side, while the biblical Protestant has not a word in self-defense for his substitution of Sunday for Saturday.

Who can ever forget the virtuous indignation manifested by the biblical preachers through the length and breadth of our country, from every Protestant pulpit, as long as the question of opening the World's Fair on Sunday was yet undecided, and who does not know to-day, that one sect, to mark its holy indignation at the decision, has never yet opened the boxes that contained its articles at the World's Fair?

These superlatively good and unctuous Christians, by conning over their Bible carefully, can find their counterpart in a certain class of "unce gude" people in the days of the Redeemer, who haunted him night and day, distressed beyond measure and scandalized beyond forbearance, because he did not keep the Sabbath in as straight-laced manner as themselves. They hated him for using common sense in reference to the day, and he found no epithets expressive enough of his supreme contempt for their Pharisaical pride. And it is very probable that the divine mind has not modified the views to-day, anent the blatant outcry of their followers and sympathizers at the close of this nineteenth century. But when we add to all the fact that whilst the Pharisees kept the true Sabbath, our modern Pharisees, counting on the credulity and simplicity of their dupes, have never seen in their lives kept the true Sabbath which their Divine Master kept to his dying day, and which his apostles kept, after his example, for thirty years afterwards, according to the sacred record.

This most glaring contradiction, involving a deliberate sacrilegious rejection of a most positive precept is presented to us to-day in the action of the biblical Christian world. The Bible and the Sabbath constitute the watchword of Protestantism; but we have demonstrated that it is the Bible against their Sabbath.

That immense concourse of biblical Christians, the Methodists, have declared that the Sabbath has never been abrogated, whilst the followers of the Church of England, together with her daughter, the Episcopal Church of the United States, are committed by the 20th Article of Religion, already quoted, to the ordinance that the Church cannot lawfully ordain anything "contrary to God's word written." God's written word enjoins his worship to be observed on Saturday, absolutely, repeatedly, and most emphatically, with a most positive threat of death to him who disobeys. All the biblical sects occupy the same self-stultifying position which no explanation can modify, much less justify.

How truly do the words of the Holy Spirit apply to this deplorable situation! "Iniquitas novabis est sibi." "Iniquity hath lied to itself." Proposing to follow the Bible only as teacher, yet, before the world, the sole teacher, is ignominiously thrust aside, and the teaching and practice of the Catholic Church—"the mother of abominations," when it suits their purpose so to designate her—adopted, despite the most terrible threats pronounced by God himself against those who disobey the command, "Remember to keep holy the Sabbath."

Should any of the reverend parsons, who are habituated to howl so vociferously over every real or assumed desecration of that pious fraud, the Bible, Sobbath, think well of entering a protest against our logical and scriptural dissection of their mongrel pet, we can promise them that any reasonable attempt on their part to gather up the disjecta wonders of the hybrid, and to restore to it a galvanized existence, will be now with genuine cordiality and respectful consideration on our part.

But we can assure our readers that we know these reverend howlers too well to expect a solitary bark from them in this instance. And they know us too well to subject themselves to the mortification which a further dissection of this anti-scriptural question would necessarily entail. Their policy now is to "lay low," and they are sure to adopt it.

As Protestants have heretofore, on every other subject wherein they differed from the Roman Catholic Church, been ready and on hand with facts and impregnable scripture argument that would soon satisfy any inquiring mind; and as on this subject wherein they have been challenged by the Church of Rome, ever since the early days of the Reformation,* to be consistent Protestants—follow the Bible alone and complete the Reformation from this as well as from the other unscriptural institutions of the Church of Rome; and as we have found them appealing to the Catholic fathers for evidence for Sunday keeping, and have not seen from them the first attempt to face this challenge of the Catholic Church, and prove it false by the Bible alone; let us turn to their best standard encyclopedias, theological works, and the writings of the most representative living Protestants and inquire if by their admissions on this subject they are compelled to surrender to the Roman Catholic Church.

Do some of the best known orthodox standard theological writers admit that there is not found in the Bible any instruction or command from Christ or his apostles to change the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the week?

There is not on record any divine command issued in the apostles to change the Sabbath from the day on which it was held by the Jews, to the first day of the week.—Encyclopaedia of Religious Knowledge, by B. B. Edwards, Art. Sabbath.

After giving all of the arguments for Sunday keeping, Dr. Buck says:—

These arguments, however, are not satisfactory to some; and it must be confessed that there is no law in the New Testament concerning the first day.—Buch's Theological Dictionary, Art. Sabbath.

The day is now changed from the seventh to the first day; . . . but as we need with no scriptural direction for the change, we may conclude it was done by the authority of the church.—Protestant Episcopal Church, Explanation of Catechism.

Now there is not on record any divine command to the apostles to change the Sabbath from the day on which it was held by the Jews to the first day of the week.—Richard Watson's Theological Dictionary.

Where there is no testimony there can be no faith. Now there is no testimony in all the oracles of heaven that the Sabbath was changed, or that the Lord's day came in the room of it.—Alexander Campbell, in Washington (Pa.) Reporter, Oct. 8, 1821.

The current notion that Christ and his apostles authoritatively substituted the first day of the week for the seventh, is absolutely without authority in the New Testament.—Lyman Abbott, D. D., in the Christian Union, Jan. 19, 1882.

Do they admit that it cannot be proved by the Bible that Christ or his apostles ever instituted or even actually observed the first day of the week as the Sabbath? Dr. William Smith, LL.D., after examining the texts supposed to have reference to Sunday keeping, says:—

Taken separately, perhaps, or even all together, these passages seem scarcely adequate to prove that the dedication of the first day of the week to the purpose afore-mentioned was a matter of apostolic institution, or even of apostolic practice.—Smith's Bible Dictionary, Art. Lord's Day.

The "Encyclopaedia Britannica," after calling attention to the usual scriptural arguments for Sunday keeping, says:—

Still it must be owned that these passages are not sufficient to prove the apostolic institution of the Lord's day, or even the actual observance of it.—Art. Sabbath.

Do they admit that the first day of the week was set apart simply by man, and in later times than those of Christ and his apostles: hence is not a divine ordinance?

Was the first day of the week set apart by public authority in the apostolic age? No. By whom was it set apart, and when? By Constantine, who lived about the beginning of the fourth century.—Alexander Campbell, lecture in Bethany College, 1848, quoted in Proclamation and Reformer, Cincinnati.

The festival Sunday, like all other festivals, was always only a human ordinance; and it was far from the intention of the apostles to establish a divine command in this respect,—far from them and the early apostolic church, to transfer the laws of the Sabbath to Sunday. Perhaps at the end of the second century a false application of this kind had begun to take place.—Neander's Church History, translated by H. J. Rose, p. 168.

We hear less than we used to about the apostolic origin of the present Sunday observance, and for the reason that while the Sabbath and Sabbath rest are woven into the warp and the woof of scripture, it is now seen, as it is admitted, that we must go to later than apostolic times for the establishment of Sunday observance.—Christian at Work, Feb. 18, 1886.

Does the largest Protestant denomination in one of its popular and most widely circulated theological works, admit that upon this most important subject they forsake the Protestant rule of faith—the Bible only—and the discipline of their church (Art. 8), and believe, like the Catholic Church, something that is not recorded in the Bible,—that tradition in the matter of the Sabbath they observe is to be preferred before what is written in the Bible?

It is true there is no positive command for infant baptism, . . . nor is there any for keeping holy the first day of the week. Jesus, after his resurrection, changed the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the week. . . . When Jesus gave instruction for this chance we are not told, but very likely during the time when he spoke to his disciples of things pertaining to his kingdom. Acts 1:3. This is probably one of the many unrecorded things which Jesus did. John 20:30; 31:25.—Staney's Theological Compend Improved, by Rev. Amos Binney and Rev. Daniel Steele, D. D., pp. 171, 181.

But let us hear the ablest and most popular living Protestant writers, who have won laurels, writing on this subject; and those who occupy the leading positions in the largest and most influential religious organizations in the country,—those whose time is devoted to the study and work of Sabbath reform: how do they succeed in sustaining Sunday keeping by the Protestant rule of faith—"the Bible and the Bible only"?—are they compelled to submit to this charge of the Catholic Church, and take their stand on Catholic grounds?

Rev. A. E. Waffle, M. A. (Baptist), Professor of Historic and English Literature in Lewisburg (Pa.) University, who won the one thousand dollar prize offered by the American Sunday School Union, for the best essay on the Sunday Question, says in "The Lord's Day," pp. 186, 187:—

Up to the time of Christ's death, no change had been made in the day. The authority must be sought in the words or in the example of the inspired apostles. . . . So far as the record shows, they [the apostles] did not, however, give any explicit command enjoining the abandonment of the seventh-day Sabbath and its observance upon the first day of the week.

Leaflet No. 3, published by the Sabbath Observance Department of the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union, edited by Mrs. J. C. Bateham, who is superintendent of that department, and is also one of the editors of the Christian Statesman, has this:—

Question 6.—If Jesus wished the day changed, why did he not command it? Answer.—A command to celebrate the resurrection could not wisely be made before the resurrection occurred. He (probably!!) gave his own disciples such direction afterwards, "when speaking of things pertaining to the kingdom."

Rev. Geo. S. Mott, D. D., acting president of the American Sabbath Union (which was organized and is coöperated in by fourteen of the leading denominations of the United States), speaking in the organ of that association (Pearl of Days Leaflet, No. 3), very aptly describes the predicament they all would be in if they followed the Protestant rule, "the Bible only," in the matter of evidence for Sunday keeping: thus giving up the argument to the Catholic Church. He says:—

Our opponents declare, "We are not satisfied with inferences and suppositions: show us where the first day is spoken of as holy, or as being observed instead of the seventh; we must have a direct and positive command of God." We admit there is no such command. But if we are to be limited by such a demand, all of us shall soon find ourselves in a very entangling predicament.

Yes, an entangling predicament, indeed, for you all: for if you remained true Protestants, following "the Bible only," and continuing to forsake and protest against the traditions and errors of the Catholic Church, until the Reformation was complete, loyalty to God's word would lead you to forsake that institution of the Catholic Church and keep the only Sabbath commanded in the Bible.

Does not the Mirror well say that "reason and common sense demand the acceptance of one or the other of these alternatives; either Protestantism and keeping holy of Saturday, or Catholicity and the keeping of Sunday. Compromise is impossible."

"Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? . . . Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. . . . But in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men."

Matt. 15:1-9. ISAAC MORRISON.
