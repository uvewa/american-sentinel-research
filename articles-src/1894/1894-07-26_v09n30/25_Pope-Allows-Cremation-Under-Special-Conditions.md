THE POPE has decided that burning of the dead "may be allowed under special conditions." Upon this the Investigator remarks: "There was a time when popes of Rome decided that burning of the living was perfectly proper. Leo XIII, thinks cremation 'heretical in principle.' How tenderly Romanism handles dead men, but how roughly it has handled live ones."
