ALL that religious societies have a right to ask of the civil government is the same privileges for transacting their own affairs which societies of every sort possess. This they have a right to demand, not because they are religious societies, but because the exercise of religion is an innocent mode of pursuing happiness. If it happens accidentally that others are benefited, it does not follow that they are obliged to pay for this benefit. It cannot be proved that the Christian religion needs the support of the civil government, since it has existed and flourished when entirely deprived of this support.—Rev. Dr. Wayland's Political Economy.
