"The members of the London Teachers' Association," says the London Correspondent of the New York Sun, "have refused to comply with the request of the tyrannical school board that they should individually explain why they wish to be excused from giving the form of religious instruction required by the famous circular. It remains to be seen what the board will do in face of the defiance of the teachers."
