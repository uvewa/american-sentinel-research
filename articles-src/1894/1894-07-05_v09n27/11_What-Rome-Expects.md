According to the Catholic Reading Circle Review, during his recent visit to this city, Mgr. Satolli gave a private interview to Rev. Jacob McMahon, director of the League of the Sacred Heart in the cathedral, here and chairman of the executive committee of the Catholic summer school of America. During the course of the interview the subject of the summer school came up. Mgr. Satolli said he had heard of that institution of intellectual training and wished to learn fully its objects and methods. He listened very attentively to the explanation offered by Father McMahon, who described in detail the history, the objects and the usefulness of the school. Mgr. Satolli encouraged him and blest the work, saying: "From the experience that I have gathered in America, I do believe that it is the country of all others in which Catholic truth may have the largest field of action. We only need freedom of speech, and this is most ample in America. I would be very much pleased to see the Catholic summer school incorporate with its object, the presentation to the American people of the precise idea of the relations by which is established the harmony between the Church and the State, so much to be desired and so fruitful of good. In this matter I find a great want of knowledge in America. I am speaking about what is commonly called public ecclesiastical law, which precisely deals with the foundation, or better, the essential constitution of the Church and the State, and determines the limits of the action of both authorities in such a way as to prevent the conflicts that unfortunately disturb social peace and retard social progress."
