While the Holy Scriptures command us to be subject to "rulers" and to "the higher powers," they in no wise require us to surrender our freedom of conscience or to obey the State in preference to God. Christ clearly distinguished between the things that are God's and the things that are Caesar's. And while he always obeyed the civil law, he submitted to civil crucifixion rather than to surrender his claim as Messiah. Just so Peter and the other apostles when required by the Jewish clergy, vested with civil authorities, to abstain from preaching the cutting truths of the gospel, nobly answered: "We ought to obey God rather than men." Acts 5:29.
