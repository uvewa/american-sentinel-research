REPRESENTATIVE DURBOROW, who was an enthusiastic supporter of the bill providing for the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday, proposes to introduce a bill providing for the opening of the public buildings in this city on Sunday, and for keeping them open until six o'clock on the evenings of the week days. The congressman says that he expects much opposition from those who believe in the puritanical idea of the Sabbath as the only proper one, but that they will be overthrown. The opposition that the World's Fair Sunday opening bill met in Congress, Mr. Durborow thinks, will be arrayed against this bill also. He says he is not to be deterred by the experience of the Fair managers, who found that the people would not visit anything on Sunday but the Midway Plaisance. "I am led to believe," he says, "by the fact that this city is largely composed of intelligent, progressive, and liberal people, that the masses will gladly avail themselves of any chance to obtain pleasure and knowledge at the same time, even though it is to be done on Sunday. If we give the people here the opportunity they will show us that our efforts have not been wasted."—Washington Cor. N. Y. Sun.
