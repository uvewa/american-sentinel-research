If there is any bill that richly deserves to be passed by the present Parliament, it is the one for the abolition of religious prosecutions, which proposes the repeal of certain ancient laws, as, for instance, the law (Act 1 Edward VI., c. 1) "against such as shall unreverently speak against the sacrament of the altar;" the section of 1 Elizabeth, c. 2, which is directed against anything in derogation of the Book of Common Prayer; the section of 21 George III., c. 45, directed against Sunday lectures and debates; and so much of the Act of 6 George IV., c. 47, as relates to "blasphemy" in Scotland. One would think that the naming of these laws would be all the argument necessary to secure their prompt repeal: yet the English Churchman says of the proposal: "Thus the extreme radicals—we hope unconsciously—further the interests of Romanism and infidelity." Such laws as these are the outgrowth of Romanism, and the breeders of infidelity.—Present Truth, London.
