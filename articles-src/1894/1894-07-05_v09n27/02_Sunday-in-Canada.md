The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, at its meeting at St. John, N. B., on Monday evening, June 18, adopted the following, relative to Sunday, to which Presbyterians uniformly, but erroneously, apply the title, Sabbath:—

1. That every presbytery hold a conference on the subject of Sabbath observance during the year, and that presbyteries arrange to have the claims and obligations of the Sabbath brought prominently before the congregations within their bounds, and, also so far as possible, before the non-church going population.

2. That the ministers and members of our church exercise scrupulous carefulness with regard to the observance of the Lord's day, and seek by word and example to maintain the sanctity of the day.

3. That the assembly express its general approval of the bill for the better observance of the Lord's day, recently before Parliament, and records its appreciations of the efforts of the promoters of this scheme, Mr. John Charlton and others, and deeply regrets the action of the Senate in throwing it out, after it had passed the House of Commons, and moreover the assembly strongly protests against that action.

In speaking on the subject, Dr. Armstrong said the Sunday newspaper, which began in the United States at the time of the war, was a greater evil than the war itself. The papers now were large sheets containing large masses of scandalous stories which were unfit for family reading. They were such that we would wish to lift them from our houses on a fork.

Dr. Armstrong moved that the report be received.

Rev. Mr. McKellar felt that the assembly should take particular notice of the treatment given the Sunday bill by the Senate. It was not right that the assembly should say that it deprecated this procedure, but it should raise its voice against it. It was too bad that such a body should be allowed to throw out a bill that provided for Sabbath observance. A stronger expression should be used in the recommendation in the report in reference to the bill's usage by the Senate. He moved that the assembly raise its voice against the action of the Senate in throwing out the Sunday bill and would even go further to say that that body should be abolished altogether. It would be a step toward liberty, and no body would welcome the abolishing of the Senate more than the Presbyterians of Canada. He also moved that the feelings of the assembly on the subject be forwarded to the Senate.

Rev. E. Nichols moved,

That presbyteries be recommended to appoint deputations to wait upon members of Parliament and parliamentary candidates within their bounds, with a view to securing their support for legislation providing for the better observance of the Lord's day.

Rev. Mr. McKellar said he believed it was the sentiment of this country that the sooner the Senate was done away with the better. Any body that would throw out such a bill was not worthy of existence. The Senate meant to allow our children to grow up in that way that they would desecrate the Sabbath law. The people of to-day were afraid to speak their minds for fear of giving offense, but we must speak for our liberty.

Mr. Nichol said he was told that we were on the eve of an election, and he was also told that nearly every member in Ontario had pledged himself to prohibition. They could probably be induced to support the Sabbath bill.

Rev. Mr. Monroe was afraid that it would be a great battle to save our Sabbath, and he felt the people must vigorously get into the work.

Mr. Nichol's resolution was carried, and the report was adopted as a whole.

Dr. Campbell said Montreal was greatly affected with the Sunday newspapers, managed by a class of men who called themselves free thinkers. The papers were put under the very noses of Christian people, and gave much offense. In refusing to pass the bill the Senate had made a great political offense, which was for them worse than a crime.

Mr. Walter Paul, of Montreal, agreed with what Dr. Campbell had said.

Dr. Thornburn, of Ottawa, thought Sunday funerals were most objectionable features. They interfered with the Sunday schools, and he believed they should be done away with. The Sabbath was not as well observed as it was ten or twenty years ago, and they were going down hill.
