PORL. LEO, in an encyclical letter dated November 7, 1885, reported by cable to the New York Herald, . . . says:

"We exhort all Catholics to devote careful attention to public matters, and take part in all municipal affairs and elections, and all public services, meetings and gatherings. All Catholics must make themselves felt as active elements in daily political life in countries where they live. All Catholics should exert their power to cause the constitutions of states to be modeled on the principles of the true church."

The pope issued at Rome, January 10, 1890, . . . a letter in which he says:

"Furthermore, in politics, which are inseparably bound up with the laws of morality and religious duties, men ought always, and in the first place, to serve, as far as possible, the interests of Catholicism. As soon as they are seen to be in danger, all differences should cease between Catholics. Since the fate of States depends principally on the disposition of those who are at the head of the government, the church cannot grant its patronage or favor to men whom it knows to be hostile to it, who openly refuse to respect its rights; who seek to break the alliance established by the nature of things between religious interests and the interests of the civil order."

The pope's encyclical letters of 1885 and 1890 are direct attacks upon the institutions of this country, and to them is due the great increased membership of the different patriotic associations.—North American (Phila.), March 14, 1894.
