"The Dogs and the Fleas," is a bold and somewhat overdrawn sketch of the present condition of society, wherein the workers are the dogs, and the bankers, bondholders, corporations and capitalists, both domestic and foreign, are the fleas, which are sucking the blood of the dogs and keeping the latter in a state of starvation.

This book tells much truth, but it also omits much. Our sympathies are with the downtrodden and oppressed everywhere, but capital is not alone responsible for the ills of labor. Thrift and Waste, Economy and Extravagance, must not be left out of the calculation. Nor is the assumption warranted that men with money and men without money differ essentially in their nature. The inhumanity of capital to labor is not greater than is the inhumanity of labor toward labor. Trade-unionism is quite as intolerant as capital. The inevitable conclusion is that the evils complained of in the book under discussion are due primarily not to any social or economic system, but to fallen human nature—wrong systems being themselves a result, rather than a cause.
