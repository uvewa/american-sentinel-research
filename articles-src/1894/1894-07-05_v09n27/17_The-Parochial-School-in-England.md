At their recent annual meeting the Catholic bishops of England united with Cardinal Vaughan, the archbishop of Westminster, in a deliverance on public elementary education which coincides in many respects with the views of Archbishop Corrigan in regard to the public schools of this country. The deliverance is in part as follows:—

"That, while political power and the responsibilities of self-government are more and more devolving upon the masses of the people, and while obvious dangers menace the future of society, it is to the country's highest advantage that religious principles of life and conduct should be deepened and strengthened in the souls of all during the period of elementary education, and that these advantages can be adequately secured, so far as the education of Catholics is concerned, only by Catholic public elementary schools, conducted under Catholic management.

"That Catholic parents cannot in conscience accept or approve for their children a system of education in which secular instruction is divorced from education in their religion.

"That Catholic parents cannot in conscience accept or approve for their children a system of religious education based upon private interpretations of the Bible given by school teachers, whether trained in religious knowledge or untrained.

"That the only system of religious education which Catholic parents can accept for their children is that given under the authority and direction of the Catholic Church, which they believe that Christ himself has appointed to teach all those things which he has revealed.

"That to take the management of schools intended for Catholic children out of the hands of those who represent the religious convictions of their parents, and to place it in the hands of public ratepayers who cannot represent those convictions, is a violation of parental rights, to be resisted as an unwarrantable attack upon religious liberty and upon a fundamental law of nature.

"That Catholic public elementary schools, satisfying the demands of the Education Department, have a right to as full a share of public money, whether from the rates or from the taxes, as any other public elementary schools in the country, and that it is unjust to deprive them of it because of the religious instruction required by the parents, which is given to the children attending such schools.

"That, in the present religious condition of the people of England, the State ought to observe a consistent and strict impartiality in respect to religious education, whether given in voluntary or board schools; and to distribute for 'maintenance,' to all public elementary schools fulfilling the requirements of the Education Department, an equal proportionate share of public money collected for public elementary education.

"That compulsory State education is an intolerable tyranny, unless due regard be paid by the State to the education of the children in their own religion; that happily, in the case of pauper and semi-criminal children, such regard is part of the English law, which makes provision for the education of such children in their own faith; and that, therefore, consistency and justice require that the children of the honest working classes, who are compelled under penalties to attend school, should not be less advantageously provided for in respect to education in their own religion."

A committee was appointed, with Cardinal Vaughan as chairman, to draft a bill for presentation to Parliament providing for the expenditure in the maintenance of Catholic schools of a proportionate part of the public money raised for the purposes of elementary education.—New York Sun.
