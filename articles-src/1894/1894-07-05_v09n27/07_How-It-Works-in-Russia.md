The American Sentinel cites some statements made in regard to holidays before the Committee on Education and Labor of the United States Senate, on December 13, 1888. At that hearing Mr. Crafts submitted a paper which purports to be "questions" by workingmen to himself, and his answers. One of these workmen asks him the question, "Could not this weekly rest-day be secured without reference to religion, by having the workmen of an establishment scheduled in regular order for one day of rest per week, whichever was most convenient, not all resting on one day?" Answer—"A weekly day of rest has never been permanently secured in any land, except upon the basis of religious obligation. Take the religion out, and you take the rest out. Greed is so strong that nothing but God and the conscience of a man can keep him from capturing all the days for toil." It is a suggestive fact that in Russia "religious obligation" demands usually two, and often three days a week from the time devoted to toil, and that these days are usually spent, not in rest, but in drinking. If the ecclesiastical authorities of that country could be induced to lessen the number of saints' days and church festivals, it would be an excellent thing for Russian industry.—Free Russia.
