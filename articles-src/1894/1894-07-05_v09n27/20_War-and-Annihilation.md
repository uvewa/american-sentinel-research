A prominent French writer, in an article upon the capacity of the new rifles for destruction, says that a battlefield at the end of a general engagement between two such armies as European governments would be likely to put into the field would be covered with two or three hundred thousand corpses, crushed and mangled. There would be none left to bury the dead and pestilence would break out in the surrounding country. In such a state of affairs he declares War would be regarded as a monster in history, and that he would be sure to bring annihilation upon his own people.—Exchange.
