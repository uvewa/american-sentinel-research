Three Sundays of closed drug stores have not made the people any more satisfied with the mayor's narrow ideas of his duty in enforcing the laws. There were more cases last Sunday, where physicians and patients had to send to outside cities to get prescriptions filled. It is difficult to make the friends of those suffering from sickness, very enthusiastic over the "high moral ground" which, we are assured by the mayor's friends, is the sole ground for his enforcement of antiquated Blue Laws.—Everett (Mass.) Republican.
