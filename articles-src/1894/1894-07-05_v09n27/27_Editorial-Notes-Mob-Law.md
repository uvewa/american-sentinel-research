Mon law has run wild in Colorado, and the Adjutant-General of the State has been seized by a mob, and tarred and feathered. But it is not alone by mobs that the law is violated, and the rights of the people outraged. At Atlantic City, N. J., June 27, Mrs. Justus R. Rice, the evangelist, while preaching on the street, was arrested and taken before Recorder Goulden, charged with disorderly conduct. Before the beginning of the hearing she asked for time to secure witnesses, but the Recorder met her request with the reply: "I'll give you a dose of Jersey justice," and then he sentenced her to thirty days in the county jail, and to pay a fine of $50. The matter was finally laid before Attorney Clarence Cole, who declared the woman's arrest and trial illegal and proceeded to draw up the papers necessary for her release. When magistrates themselves commit such things what wonder that the people make and execute laws when occasion seems to them to demand it.
