THERE is to be no opposition, we believe, on the part of Roman Catholics, to the adoption of an amendment to the constitution of this State, which shall forbid any diversion of public moneys, raised for the public schools, to sectarian schools. They agree that no money shall be appropriated to parochial schools, and that the public schools themselves shall be kept entirely free from sectarian control.

This is a wise concession; but a contest is to be made over the rest of the proposed constitutional amendment. At a hearing granted last week, representatives of the Roman Catholic and Jewish denominations were heard in opposition to a constitutional inhibition of appropriations to orphan asylums, protectorates and similar institutions where boys and girls of the neglected and delinquent classes and other unfortunates are received and cared for. On the part of the Jews it was denied that there are any sectarian teachings in their orphan asylum, or that a cent of the money received from the State is used for any other purpose than that of making the children good citizens. On behalf of the Catholics one argument was, that it cost the State much less to have the dependent classes cared for in private institutions than it would to establish institutions of its own for the same purpose. But the economical argument is really not a very strong one. Whatever it is the duty of the State to do, it ought to do and do well, and do at its own expense.

Of course reasons can be given in favor of helping such a charitable institution as Burnham's Farm, where boys are received and carefully trained to become useful citizens, and where the primary purpose is not a religious but a benevolent purpose. This enterprise is, however, under the care of Protestants and is sectarian, in the sense that it is Protestant rather than Catholic or Jewish. If such an institution as this were admitted as an exception, it would manifestly be impossible to exclude Hebrew orphan asylums and Catholic protectorates from the same benefits.

It was pointed out by one of the Catholic speakers that, according to the certified statement of the Comptroller of New York City, Catholic institutions received in 1893, $603,815; Protestant, $502,729, and Hebrew, $148,000. The fact that Protestant institutions are participants in the use of public funds is, of course, not a valid reason against the amendment. If the Catholic Church were not represented in this country, and there were none but Protestant denominations, or vice versa, there probably would not be so strenuous an effort to prevent sectarian appropriations. But Catholics and Protestants are here face to face, and the question of appropriations is bound to stir up jealousies and animosities between them. The only way to have peace is to prohibit the appropriation of public funds, either State or municipal, to institutions under sectarian control. This is not only a question of expediency but of principle—the sound principle of the entire separation of Church and State. No matter whether Protestant or Catholic institutions get the bulk of the appropriations. Let all fare alike. Put both on the same absolute equality. Let neither have a cent from State or city.—The N. Y. Independent.
