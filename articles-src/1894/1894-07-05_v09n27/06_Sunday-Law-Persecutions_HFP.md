Many there be who vainly imagine that persecution is not possible in this enlightened age. If told that the Russian Government is engaged in a course of systematic persecution of Stundists, Jews, and Baptists, many of whom are now languishing in jails for the sake of their religion and who are sent in detachments, large or small, in company with common criminals to remote districts of Siberia or trans-Caucasia, there to expiate their heresy, without trial of any sort, and that at the mere word of suspicion from a bigoted priesthood or an equally bigoted police, this followed by command of governors of provinces; and their homes broken up, their children taken from them, and they themselves transported to the most inhospitable regions of the whole empire for a term of years, in most cases to die in exile,—these things are received with an air of incredulity, or with the answer: "That is in despotic Russia."

Yes, but if equally infamous things are carried on in this country, and that by professed Protestant Christians, are these any better than Russians? If that is despotism, and who would deny it, what is this but despotism? If that is persecution, what is this but persecution? If that is actuated by a spirit of bigotry, what is this, and what better are those who engage in it than the rest of the bigots? If men are deprived of their liberties for conscience' sake, compelled to languish in damp, dismal jails, where they contract disease from which they die, are compelled to work in the chain-gang with common criminals for no other reason than that they dare differ from their neighbors in matters of religion, dragged from court to court at the behests of secret informers, bigoted officers, narrow-minded juries and partisan judges? All this, and more, in this boasted land of liberty, what are we better than other bigots? And what better is this country than Russia? and we better than the Russians? And if such things are possible under religious laws in Russia, and the enforcement of Sunday laws in this country produce similar results, where is the difference? If Russia's laws should be modified, what should be done with these? We will leave the reader to say.—H. F. Phelps, in the Argus, Red Wing, Minn.
