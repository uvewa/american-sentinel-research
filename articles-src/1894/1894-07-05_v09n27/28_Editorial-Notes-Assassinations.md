The world was startled on Sunday evening, June 24, by the assassination of President Carnot of France. As usual the assassin was an anarchist, but whether acting alone or as the tool of others is not known.

Only a few days prior to the assassination of President Carnot, a plot to blow up the czar's special train was discovered; and about the same time an attempt was made on the life of Premier Crispi of Italy.

Whether the anarchists designed to terrify the world by the assassination of several of the rulers of Christendom within a few days of each other may never be known, but whatever the intention there is probably not a crowned head, or indeed a very prominent man, anywhere, who has not felt a degree of alarm bordering on apprehension of impending evil.

Ex-President Harrison has also received some unpleasant attention from a woman who proposes to assist him to "save the country," and this has caused Mr. Harrison's friends some uneasiness. An Indianapolis dispatch of the 26th ult. says:—

Her appearance at Harrison's house caused many of the friends of the ex-president to be solicitous for his safety, and to-day the superintendent of police was requested to instruct the patrolman on the Delaware Street beat to be specially vigilant and to bring to the station all lotterers found near the Harrison residence. Harrison himself, it is said, does not feel any concern for his safety, but friends believe that social conditions are such that any man of special prominence is in danger from cranks.

Truly "men's hearts are failing them for fear, and for looking after those things that are coming on the earth."
