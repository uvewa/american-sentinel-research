The pope has complained in a personal letter to the czar that in several districts of Russia the Orthodox inhabitants are maltreating Catholics. It is said that in the event of the pope's remonstrance proving ineffectual he will publish a statement on the subject, probably in the form of an appeal to the Christian sentiment of the world. We do not remember that anything of the kind was ever done by any pope when "heretics" were being maltreated by Catholics. It makes a vast difference to "his holiness" (?) whose ox is gored.
