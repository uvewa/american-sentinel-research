A London paper notes the fact that in a recent election in New Zealand the women, who by the way voted for the first time, cast their ballots, as a rule, for the candidate professing Christianity. Our English contemporary remarks that "many people will doubtless hail this as a wonderful addition to the cause of Christianity, but thoughtful ones will see in it a special bid in favor of hypocrisy. When a profession of Christianity is generally considered essential to public office, every political hack in the world will at once profess Christianity, and will shout himself hoarse in his anxiety to demonstrate the strength of his profession."
