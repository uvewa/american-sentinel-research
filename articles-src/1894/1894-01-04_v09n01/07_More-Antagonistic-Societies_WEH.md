An organization known as "The Society of Liberty and Loyalty" is coming into prominence in the city of Denver, Colo., "called into existence by the growth of the American Protective Association," the purpose of which is stated to be "diametrically opposite to that of the proscriptive order." "The intention," says the Rocky Mountain News, "is to centralize the American idea of freedom and equal rights to all," in opposition to "the un-American idea of bigotry masquerading under the name of religion." If, by "the American idea of freedom and equal rights to all" is meant the idea which prevailed in forming the Constitution of the United States, the "intention" is a good one; but it cannot possibly be carried out by taking and keeping an oath to uphold the laws of Colorado, as each member of this society is required to do, or by pursuing a course based upon the first principle in the declaration of principles set forth by the society, as will appear from further consideration. What was once "the American idea of freedom and equal rights to all" is fast becoming "the un-American idea of bigotry masquerading under the name of religion"—"National Reform,"—from which the laws of even Colorado itself are not free. It is not to be supposed the American Protective Association will claim for itself perfection; but even granting that it were as bad as this new-fangled thing would make it appear, it can hardly be believed that its openly avowed hostility to the Catholics in political circles is more dangerous to "freedom and equal rights to all," than is the result of the insinuating methods used by the National Reform Association.

Now, as the National Reformers themselves assert, nearly every State in the Union has a law forbidding common labor on Sunday. The work of National Reformers is to enforce these laws, which is nothing less than abridging the freedom and equal rights of those whose religious belief leads them to observe another day of the week than the first. And the president of this new sort of liberty and loyalty is himself a zealous advocate of Sunday laws.

The first article in the declaration of principles of the Society of Liberty and Loyalty, is as follows:—

> We believe that all persons should be protected in their right to worship God after the dictates of their own conscience, as long as that worship is not in the nature of a violation of the Constitution and laws of the land.

If the Society of Liberty and Loyalty would eliminate the last clause of this article,—which limits man's right to worship God after the dictates of his own conscience, to its not conflicting with the laws of the land,—every liberty-loving citizen could subscribe to it; for this right does not depend upon the Constitution and laws of the land, and the only limitation it has is to respect the same right in others. If the laws themselves proscribe the freedom and equal rights of citizens, they ought not to be supported. And, since laws do exist abridging the freedom and equal rights of citizens, as before proved, the Society of Liberty and Loyalty, by subscribing to the first article of their declaration of principles, bind themselves to do just the opposite of what is avowed to be their intention to do.

Again, in the first paragraph of the oath, the members swear to uphold by word and act the laws of Colorado. One of the laws of this State reads:—

> Any person who shall hereafter knowingly disturb the peace and good order of society, by labor or amusement, on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday (works of necessity and charity excepted), shall be fined, on conviction thereof, in any sum not exceeding fifty dollars.

By upholding this law the Society of Liberty and Loyalty gives support to "bigotry masquerading under the name of religion," to oppose which is the stated intention of its founders. The intention may be sincere, and is certainly commendable; but the intenders either are not aware of the existence of such a law on the statute book of their State, or else entirely ignore it. Whichever it be, both the declaration of principles and the oath are inconsistent with the published intention of the society, and are weak weapons with which to oppose "bigotry masquerading under the name of religion."

The Society of Liberty and Loyalty needs to revise its declaration of principles and to stand on a broader platform before it can hope to oppose successfully the American Protective Association or any similar organization.
