## THE MEMORIAL OF GOD'S POWER.

We have also a sign of the power of God pledged to us for redemption. That sign God himself has set up as a reminder to all the human family that they might remember him, that they might remember his power, that they might remember that his creative power has been pledged for salvation. This sign is as old as the exhibition of the power, and it is worth while to notice that this sign is referred to again and again as a continual reminder of the power of God. Three or four scriptures will bring these things together, that we may see this fact.

In the first chapter of Genesis we have a record of the creative power of God as manifested through Jesus Christ. At the close of the work we read, beginning with the first verse of the second chapter: "Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made. And he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made." Remember that it was Christ through whom this power was manifested. Remember, therefore, that it was Christ who rested, and by whom this blessing was pronounced upon this day. Turning over now to the time when Christ spoke to the people from Mount Sinai, and when he rehearsed in their presence the ten commandments, we find this statement concerning this same day: "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it."

But who was it that created all things?—It was Christ. Who was it that rested at the close of the creative work?—It was Christ. Who was it that pronounced the blessing upon this day?—It was Christ. Who was it that rehearsed this fact at Sinai, and gave as a reason for the rest that he created the heaven and the earth in six days and rested on the seventh?—It was Christ. Who was it, then, that pronounced a blessing upon the day, and hallowed it, and sanctified it?—It was Christ. And for what purpose was it?—It was as a reminder of the power of God manifested through Christ in creation, that we might be comforted, that we might be encouraged, as we remember that the same power which wrought through Christ in the creation of the heaven and the earth is pledged to work through Christ for our re-creation. It is to point out in a more definite way than we learn from the material universe the redemptive work of Christ.

It should appear very plainly, as it does in the Scriptures, that the Sabbath idea is to reveal Christ to the world, Christ in creation, and so Christ in redemption. It is for this reason that the Saviour said, in Mark 2:28, "Therefore the Son of Man is Lord also of the Sabbath day." Most certainly, because it was his day. So most appropriate it is that, in Rev. 1:10, John says, "I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day." Most appropriate. This day is to remind us of the creative work of Christ, of the rest of Christ, of the power of Christ in re-creation, that is, in redemption. The Sabbath idea, the Sabbath institution, is to point out Christ to us, to reveal his power to us, and is designed to be an encouragement to every believer in Christ.

**SPIRITUAL REST.**

It is important to notice what was done to this day. The record in the second chapter of Genesis, which is the first mention that we have of the Sabbath, says, "He rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made." It is apparent to your minds at once that the Creator of the ends of the earth, who never wearies, and who never is faint, did not rest on that first seventh day because he had wearied himself in the work of creation. Said Christ to the woman of Samaria, "God is a spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth." God being spirit, his rest must be spiritual rest. And that is a matter of no small importance, because we overlook the whole idea of the Sabbath when we take it to mean a day of physical rest. Who rested on that day?—Christ, who was the agent in creation, rested on that day. Because he was tired?—Not in any sense. It was a spiritual rest. He rested and was refreshed. He took delight in viewing the works which he had made. That was the rest. Sabbath means rest, and from the very nature of the institution of the Sabbath, it means spiritual rest. Observe the practical application of that idea. If physical rest is the only idea of the Sabbath, man can rest on one day just as well as another. He can do more; he can divide up his rest during the several days of the week, and he can rest three or four hours each day, as may suit him. He may rest rainy days and work sunshiny days if he pleases, if physical rest is the only idea of the Sabbath.

Let it be understood that refraining from work is not Sabbath keeping. It may be Sunday keeping; it may be Saturday keeping; it may be Friday keeping; it may be Monday keeping, but it is not Sabbath keeping. It is not Sabbath keeping, because the idea of Sabbath is spiritual rest. And in no other way can the Sabbath be kept than as a spiritual rest. It will therefore be seen at once that all theories of Sabbath keeping which rest upon the idea of physical recuperation, are good for nothing. It is true that man can enforce abstinence from labor, but he cannot enforce Sabbath keeping. A man may be forced to refrain from physical work; he may be kept in idleness, but no one can enforce Sabbath keeping. It is a spiritual thing entirely. You will also see the consequence that grows out of this, and that is that all human devices, all human power to compel rest, with the idea of keeping the Sabbath, are wholly wrong.

Many a man who has tried to keep the Sabbath, has been unable to keep it; many a man who has longed to keep the Sabbath, has not kept it. He has refrained from work on the Sabbath day, but he has not kept the Sabbath. We shall see plainly why, as we proceed. Think of the impossibility, nay, more, think of the wickedness, of trying to compel a man to do what he himself cannot do if he wants to; trying to compel a man to do that which he himself has tried to do, perhaps for years, and has been unable to do. There must be something more than human power, there must be the power of God in Sabbath keeping. We shall see that more plainly as we go on.
