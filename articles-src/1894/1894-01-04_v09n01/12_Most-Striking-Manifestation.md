"The compulsory submission of Archbishop Corrigan," says the Converted Catholic, "to the authority of Monsignor Satolli, the papal delegate, is the most striking manifestation of the power of the Roman Church in this country that has yet appeared." It is nothing of the kind; the most striking manifestation of that power is in the truckling of so-called Protestants to the papacy. Rome might reasonably be expected to rule her own, even in America. It is the homage of her professed opponents that is a matter of astonishment.
