The Examiner (Baptist), of this city, has, in its issue of Dec. 14, 1893, a communication from J. Heinrichs, a missionary in Vinukonda, Kistna District, India, in which that gentleman defends the principle of State aid to missions. He says:—

> Some of us hold that, disunited as the Baptist denomination is from the recognized State religion, and carrying an education for its own sake, we have a right to be aided by grants from government, its supervision and educational ideals, as far as it is willing to help us in our philanthropic effort.

And this is exactly what the Romanists claim here, namely, that they have a right to be aided by grants from government; and every Baptist is up in arms against it. Consistency has indeed become a jewel by its rarity, among modern Protestants so-called.
