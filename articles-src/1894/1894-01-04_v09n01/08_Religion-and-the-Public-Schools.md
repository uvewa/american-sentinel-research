If the State provides any education, it must be secular only. If the people are taxed for public schools, the instruction in them must be wholly secular. The Boston Congregationalist expresses the hope that "the religious character of the nation will rise to so high a level that it will be felt to be necessary that every child in the land should be impressed, as an essential part of his education, with a sense of his personal responsibility to God and the supreme importance of obedience to God." It thinks, apparently, that when that elevation is reached no one will object to religious education in the public schools. But what is this "personal responsibility" and in what consists this "obedience"? The answer involves the differences which divide opinions variously and radically. They are the differences which separate Protestantism from Roman Catholicism, and split up Protestantism into so many opposing camps. Every church exists simply because it believes that obedience to God requires its specific doctrine.

Hence the public school system cannot continue except as a purely secular system. It cannot undertake to settle the vexed question of what obedience to God is. It must steer clear of all religious disputes, and to do so it must steer clear of religion altogether. The more earnest the religious convictions of people are, the more impossible is it for them to agree on an eclectic religious education. Each party wants nothing except its own understanding of obedience to God inculcated.
