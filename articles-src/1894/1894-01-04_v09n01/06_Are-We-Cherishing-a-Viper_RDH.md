Under the heading given above, the Christian Statesman of October 23, arraigns the papacy as—

> the most powerful organized enemy civil liberty has ever contended against. . . . There is not an offense against human rights and liberties but may be justly charged against the papacy. . . . By her half-heathenish system of Christianity she has held the millions under her authority in the greatest darkness, mental and spiritual. . . . The papacy has not changed. She cannot change. . . . She is so constructed that she must insist on absolute supremacy over men and nations. . . . What is the purpose of this representative of the pope among us? We know he has no sympathy with free government. . . . The government that is warming the papacy is warming a viper that will some day sting it to the heart. . . . Let the American people say to this foe of human liberty, "Hands off!"

Would that all could read the character and aims of the papacy as the Statesman has presented it. Her history for a thousand years is before us, written in the blood of the saints. And just as surely as "the fundamental doctrines of her system forbid" that she change, just so surely is she to-day insisting upon "absolute supremacy over men and nations." And in order to gain this she is looking to and silently taking captive this boasted land of liberty in which we are living. A correspondent of the New York Sun, of July 11, 1892, stated that Pope Leo XIII, "hails in the united American States and in their young and flourishing church the source of a new life for Europeans."

In the Catholic Mirror, of September 30, 1893, a European writer, in an article entitled, "Leo and Cardinal Gibbons," states that—

> in Europe they say of Cardinal Gibbons as they say of Cardinal Manning. . . . He is for many, a religion; for all, a representative man. . . . At a time when Europe is being transformed, when she is seeking eagerly for examples to imitate and models to copy, this vision is fruitful. From the Catholic point of view, this communion exercises a salutary influence. Is not Catholicity a perpetual communion, and must we not glean the golden ears from all lands? The church is a veritable ocean, with its flux and reflux renewing life at each instant. Cardinal Gibbons is for us all a power and model. The Americans will never forget (and especially in the crisis through which they are passing), that Europe has its eyes fixed upon them, and that they have a mission to fulfill. In 1890 we passed the British Channel; since the affairs of the Knights of Labor, we pass the ocean. This is why the feast of the cardinal will be a feast for us all.

In the next paragraph the writer states that above all it will be a Roman feast, and that the cardinal is one of those rare ones that understand the pontiff and his profound designs, and then exclaims, "Thus the triumph of Rome is about to become absolute."

In the Mirror of September 16, the papal ablegate, Satolli, said that "here in America is the key to the future," and that the pope had especially charged him to speak words of hope, of blessing and encouragement. But the worst of it all is that professed Protestants to-day are doing all in their power to bring this very thing about. And just as surely as Judas Iscariot was guilty when he asked the question, "Is it I?"—is the Statesman guilty of the very thing it asks. The editors of the Statesman may not realize it,—we do not believe Judas did,—until, like him, they will see at last the fatal step when it is forever too late. Does not the Statesman, which claims to read the character and aims of the papacy, know the means that was employed in the past by this power to gain this supremacy? And cannot its editors see that the very means is being employed to-day to restore power to her again, when she will say, "I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow"? We not only have it upon the pages of history as clear as the noon day sun, but we have the unerring word of God that it was done and will be done again.

"In the movement now in progress in this country to secure for the institutions and usages of the Church the support of the State, Protestants are following in the steps of the papacy; nay, more, they are opening the door for popery to regain in Protestant America the supremacy she has lost in the Old World. And that which gives greater significance to this movement is the fact that the principal object contemplated is the enforcement of Sunday observance, a custom which originated with Rome, and which she claims as the sign of her authority." In this movement the Christian Statesman has been engaged ever since it has had an existence. What is the use of arraigning the papacy when at the same time those who make the arraignment are doing the very thing that will bring the papacy into power again? Has not the Statesman said that Protestants would gladly join hands with papists if they would cooperate in resisting the progress of political atheism? And did not the Statesman state in the very issue in which this power was arraigned that in the congresses to celebrate 1900 A. D. Liberals and Catholics could unite without embarrassment? Tell us, if the Catholic Church has not changed and cannot change, how this church is going to unite in these congresses unless there is that there which is distinctly Catholic? Whenever Catholics have been invited to take part in such gatherings have they compromised any principle in so doing? Never! Cardinal Gibbons, when he was invited to make the opening prayer at the Parliament of Religions, said, "I followed the Catholic form, and stipulated that I should do so in advance. I could not have done otherwise, because there was a principle involved." But in what thing will Catholics cooperate with non-Catholics? In the Baltimore meeting of Catholic laymen it was said, "We should seek alliance with non-Catholics for proper Sunday observance." Why will they do this? Will they violate any principle in so doing? Read this statement from the Mirror of September 23, 1893:—

> The Christian Sabbath is therefore to this day the acknowledged offspring of the Catholic Church as spouse of the Holy Ghost, without a word of remonstrance from the Protestant world.

This statement occurs in a series of articles that appeared in the Catholic Mirror last September, in which it was shown conclusively that "the claims of Protestantism to any part therein [that is, in Sunday as a Christian institution] proved to be groundless, self-contradictory, and suicidal."

Thus it is seen that this very institution that professed Protestantism is cherishing so dearly is an institution of the papacy and they do not deny it. And as we see the Government "warming" this child of the papacy because of the demands of the Church people for the furtherance of their aims, we say to the Statesman again, "Thou hast said," when it did say, "The Government that is warming the papacy is warming a viper that will some day sting it to the heart," and "let the American people say to this foe of human liberty, 'hands off'."
