ISAAC BAKER, of Kent Island, Md., now in jail at Centreville, in that State, for plowing in his own field on Sunday, has received a letter from a lawyer of the city of Baltimore, addressed to him at the Centreville jail, from which the following is a paragraph:

> Some friend has sent me a pamphlet, "Our Answer," from which I learn of your incarceration for the maintenance of what to you is a religious principle. While differing widely from your religious views, I hold sacredly the creed enunciated by our forefathers in the bill of rights that no person ought, by any law, to be molested in his person or estate on account of his religious persuasion or his religious practice, provided, his religious practice does not render it impossible for others to enjoy the same privilege in differing practices. So long as the old law stands in our statute books, so long will it be the duty of judge and jury to enforce the law, but the law itself is a blot on the face of the nineteenth century, and should be repealed. From what I learn of Governor Brown I believe that a pardon would follow a presentation of the facts to him, and if you deem it proper to take such a course I shall be glad to do what I can to insure the success of an application by obtaining signatures, and otherwise, and to extend the same offer in regard to any attempt made to repeal or modify the law which bears so hardly upon you. With sincere sympathy for you and all other men who suffer rather than yield where religious principle is involved,

> I am, truly yours,

Such expressions as these are evidence of the views held by the thoughtful and unprejudiced. It would be a question what plea Mr. Baker could make to Governor Brown. He is no subject for executive clemency. He has done no wrong, and is not in the wrong,—he has been wronged. The great State of Maryland has done to him, an humble but worthy citizen, a foul injustice. What can he ask of the State of Maryland, if anything? Could be, in justice to himself and the principle for which he stands, ask of the State of Maryland, for himself, anything less than a remission of his fine and a full reimbursement for the loss of time and the expense to which he has been put; leaving upon the records, credited against the State, the ineffable history of his imprisonment, as an indelible warning against further judicial and legislative disgrace? Could Isaac Baker ask anything less than this for himself? Certainly not. And for all his fellow citizens he could ask nothing less than an unconditional repeal of all religious laws in his State.
