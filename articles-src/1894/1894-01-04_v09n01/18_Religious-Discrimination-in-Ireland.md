In the English Parliament recently, Mr. Thomas Sexton, anti-Parnellite questioned the Government as to the alleged discrimination on religious grounds in selecting jurors in Ireland. Mr. James Bryce answered that the Government had never instructed the Crown solicitors to ascertain the religious belief of jurors. Mr. Sexton said the answer was unsatisfactory, and gave notice that he would move that instruction be given to the Crown solicitors to stop the practice of challenging jurors on account of their religious belief. It is thus that these questions supposed to be long since buried once and forever are being revived.
