Is civil authority supreme and universal, or is its jurisdiction modified and limited? If the authority of civil law is not unlimited, what is it which limits that authority, and where are the boundaries set?

To understand the scope of the authority of the State it is necessary to ask what the State is and by what process it becomes of authority? Primarily the people are the State, and it is through their action that the whole people are united into one body politic constituting a State and collectively taking the name of a nation. If this action is not taken by the people there is no organized body politic and consequently no State, and no civil authority. In such a case there would be no authoritative law except the word of each patriarch requiring the obedience of his immediate family. This is the primitive and natural condition, and may exist, even has existed, where there is a considerable population. When alliances are made for the purpose of mutual protection, or convenience, or for the carrying out of individual schemes of aggrandizement, the people must either make the alliance of their own authority or acknowledge its effect and agree to submit. Whatever the form of human government, the people are the first factor. As by the exercise of the capacities and abilities which God has given them they provide for themselves in all other ways, so also they take thought, by civil organization, to care for and protect themselves in the different exigencies of social and civil life. Whatever the form of government, then, those who administer it do so by the choice or the sufferance of the governed. Every other theory of the authority of the governing over the governed is but an after-thought of those who rule, and born of a desire to usurp and permanently retain the place of authority.

Then those who administer the government are bound by the restrictions placed upon them by the body politic which delegated to them the authority which they possess; neither can they have any more authority than that given them by those whom they represent, and in case there are no specified or constitutional limitations, the stream of power cannot rise higher than its source, and the constituted authorities cannot possess higher or greater power than was possessed primarily by those from whom they received it.

There then is the limit of civil authority. Precisely that just and equitable right in reference to his fellow which was every man's prerogative to enforce against his neighbor if there were no government, exactly that, and no more, the constituted authorities have the right and duty of enforcement as between man and man throughout the body politic. Beyond this human government cannot rightfully go. So simple and easily found are the limits of civil authority. Human authority can not be supreme or universal. Man is a finite being, and can dominate nothing but what is temporal. His authority then is limited by his mortality and its boundaries are set within that finite limit. Every voice of human command which strives to assert its authority beyond that limit is but the echo of a futile blasphemy.
