## OCR Corrections Made

### Page 1, Masthead
- **OCR text:** "CALVIN F. BOLLMAN"
- **Corrected to:** "CALVIN P. BOLLMAN"
- **Reason:** Known author list shows Calvin P. Bollman (CPB), not Calvin F. Bollman. Middle initial is P.

### Page 1, Masthead
- **OCR text:** "WILLIAM B. MCKEE"
- **Corrected to:** "WILLIAM H. MCKEE"
- **Reason:** Known author list shows William H. McKee (WHM), not William B. McKee. Middle initial is H.

### Page 2, Line 107
- **OCR text:** "flamm itself in public"
- **Corrected to:** "flaunt itself in public"
- **Reason:** Context clearly indicates "flaunt" - the passage discusses immorality being driven to concealment rather than being flaunted publicly.

### Page 3, Line 167
- **OCR text:** "toobold"
- **Corrected to:** "tenfold"
- **Reason:** Context of the sentence discussing rewards - "not merely tenfold, but, say, a hundredfold" makes sense; "toobold" does not.

### Page 6, Line 294
- **OCR text:** "thy manoeuvrant, nor thy maldseivant"
- **Corrected to:** "thy manservant, nor thy maidservant"
- **Reason:** This is a direct quotation of the fourth commandment from Exodus 20:10; the correct wording is "manservant" and "maidservant."

## Notes

All other text appears to be accurate transcription from the Mistral OCR output. The OCR quality was generally very good, with only the minor corrections noted above.
