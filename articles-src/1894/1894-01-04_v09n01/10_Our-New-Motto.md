Our new motto, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, "If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world," expresses a truth which, if understood, would at once and forever settle the question of the duty of the minister of Christ. "It is enough for the disciple that he be as his Master, and the servant as his Lord."
