Two of the three Seventh-day Adventists imprisoned in Queen Anne's County, Md., for exercising their God-given right to work on Sunday, have been released. One, because his son, who was also the complaining witness, paid the fine; the other, at the expiration of thirty days. But one, Mr. Isaac Baker, is still in prison. Under date of December 18, he writes:—

Centerville, Jail, Dec. 18, 1893.

> I am still rejoicing in the blessed promises of the gospel, and when I received notice that I must remain in jail thirty days longer, deprived of civil liberty and separated from my dear wife and children, I just said, "Lord, thou knowest best!" I am daily asking God to lead me; and I know that he is leading me; and I am willing to follow.

This man is as he says deprived of civil liberty, but it is impossible to deprive a Christian of liberty in Christ. Such an one can say, even in prison, "I walk at liberty; for I seek thy precepts." The "glorious liberty of the children of God" is a thousand times better than any liberty that governments can give or take away. The Saviour's counsel is: "Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell." Few men have been called upon to endure more suffering unjustly than was the Apostle Paul, but he wrote "I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us."
