The Christian Statesman recently volunteered this bit of pertinent advice to the papacy:—

> If you want to practice your religion in peace in this land, and persuade the people that you mean well for all, then you must, somehow, get your fingers out of the politics of the country, and do as other denominations of Christians are doing—attend to your own business, and not try to overturn the sacred institutions cemented with patriot blood and tears. We very much fear you are making trouble for yourself and for the country. It is with the utmost sincerity we give you this pointer and suggest that you stop and think.

This is good advice, and is quoted by the Truth Seeker, of this city, with this comment, equally as pertinent as the advice itself:—

> Suppose, Doctors Crafts and McCrory, editors of the Christian Statesman and physicians in ordinary to his holiness the pope, that you take a little of your excellent medicine yourselves. It is good medicine, we'll guarantee that, and you need not fear to administer big doses of it to the National Reform and Sabbath Observance associations. Begin the treatment right now; get your fingers out of the politics of the country, and do as only two denominations of Christians—the Adventists and Unitarians—are doing—attend to your own business, and not try to overturn the sacred secular institutions cemented with patriot blood and tears. We are sure you are making trouble for yourselves and for the country. It is with the utmost sincerity that we give you this pointer and suggest that you stop and think.

Good as it is, this advice is wasted on the Statesman. Its editors have scented blood and have tasted political power, and they will not pause to consider the evil of their ways. "Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone."
