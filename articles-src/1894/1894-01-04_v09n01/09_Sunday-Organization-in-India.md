THERE is in India an organization known as the "Lord's Day Union," the object of which is to further in all practicable ways the observance of Sunday as a day of rest. It seeks to prevent all unnecessary labor on that day, having, of course, as an ultimate object the use of the Sabbath in a Christian way. It is a striking fact that applications are now coming for membership in this society from large numbers of non-Christian natives, so that the society is seriously perplexed. Of course it would like the aid of all men of all faiths in the prevention of unnecessary toil on the Lord's day, and yet it cannot afford to lose its distinctive Christian character as basing its obligation to observe the day upon divine authority. But it is a significant fact that Hindus and Mohammedans and Parsees recognize so clearly the value of the Christian Sabbath.—Missionary Herald.
