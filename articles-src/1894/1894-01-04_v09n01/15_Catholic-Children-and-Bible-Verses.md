The following dispatch is somewhat old for news, but serves just as well to point a moral:—

New Hope, Pa., Nov. 30.—

> Mrs. Merrick, the teacher of the public school at New Hope, decided a few days ago that all of her pupils must commit to memory and recite at the devotional exercises upon the opening of the school, a verse from the Bible. The order awakened bitter opposition from the parents of the Catholic children, but the schoolmistress was firm, and told the children that they would have to commit the verses or remain after school hours until they did so. The dissenters finally submitted. It is now rumored that the priest in charge of the parish will open a parochial school in the parish church.

Suppose the position of the parties to this contest were reversed, and the Catholics were in the majority in the district and the teacher were a Catholic, and the devotional exercises were such as to be objectionable to the Protestants,—would the principles be changed? Would it then become wrong for the teacher to remain "firm"?
