This is the heading of an article which appeared March 4, in the Western Watchman, of St. Louis, "A Catholic journal devoted to the interests of the Catholic Church in the West." There are several points in the article that are very significant and worthy of careful consideration. It is as follows:—

The Catholics who in 1870 were not more than 2,000 to 3,000 are today at least 30,000, thanks to the energy of Mons. Miladonoff. The sacrifices which the converts from among the schismatists are obliged to make to ample proof of their sincerity. The apostolic zeal of the bishop has obtained for him the imperial firman, which gives him extraordinary authority in his disease, authority not only in ecclesiastical, but in the civil courts. Thus transports, bills of sale, etc., have no value without the zeal of the Catholic bishop; all his sentences on matrimonial contracts and others, have to be executed without further investigation or proof by the civil authorities; and he has to give diplomas to school teachers. Where is there a government more clerical and ultramontane than that of the Sultan?

This, then, is "Catholicity in Macedonia." But as the article appears in a journal "devoted to the interests of the Catholic Church" in America, and thanks "the energy" of the promoter of this Catholicity, and calls it "apostolic zeal," may we not justly conclude that this is true Catholicity in America?

But there need be no question as to whether this is Catholicity in this country, and every other. It has been such ever since Constantine, over one thousand years ago, established the evil precedent of allowing the Catholic bishops to rule in civil affairs. The historian Gibbon gives a description of that precedent that has a striking similarity to parts of the article just quoted. He says:—

The Latin clergy, who erected their tribunal on the ruins of the civil and common law, have modestly accepted, as the gift of Constantine, the independent jurisdiction, which was the fruit of time, of accident, and of their own industry. The arbitration of the bishops was ratified by a positive law; and the judges were instructed to execute, without appeal or delay, the episcopal decrees.—Decline and Fall, ch. XX., par. 25.

The custom, then, of allowing Catholic ecclesiastics jurisdiction in civil courts, supreme courts at that, was in Rome, "the fruit of time, of accident, and of their own industry." But the "extraordinary authority" of the Bishop of Macedonia, "not only in ecclesiastical, but in civil courts," is attributed to his "apostolic zeal." Apostolic zeal! What a travesty on the love and fervor of those holy men of old, who went forth at the command of Him who said, "All power is given unto me. . . . Go ye therefore into all the world, and preach the gospel!" This was all the "firman" they required; and it gave them extraordinary power too. It also forever forbade them, and all who would follow Him who sent them, from seeking any power but that of the gospel, which is the power of love. But all who forsake this imperial firman are thereby deprived of its power, and as power they will have, they seek that of the State, which is that of force alone.

But that this evil should be done under the guise of Christianity, as "apostolic zeal," is a shame and blight on that holy cause. But this is Catholicity, Satan's masterpiece, an imitation and perversion of the true. How shall we escape its deceptions?—By having nothing in common with it. By ceasing to trust in men, their power, and their traditions. By trusting in God, his word and his power. In this way, and this alone.

But shall we wait till Catholicity in truth becomes Catholicity in practice, as in Macedonia? Shall we wait until "matrimonial contracts and others" have to be sanctioned by the Catholic clergy and "bills of sale, etc., are of no value without the seal of the Catholic bishop?" You know the Word of God speaks of a time when "no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast." The "mark" to which the Catholic Church points with such evident pride, and claims as distinctively its own, is the day which it has commanded to be observed as holy instead of the day which God has commanded to be observed as holy. As long as we cling to this, from whatever pretext, we are standing upon Catholic ground, and are upholding Catholicity. And "no man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other." More than this; many think that they love God, when they do not. "For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments, and his commandments are not grievous." The commandments of God forbid the keeping of the day that the Catholic Church says is holy. They command that another day, "the seventh," be kept holy. And if it be a "grievous" thing to keep it holy, where is our love for God? To know God is to love him; "but he that saith (by his profession), I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him." 1 John 2:4.

If we love God, then, more than we love the day commanded by the papacy to be kept holy, we will keep the day which his commands declare is holy. God calls upon us now to prove our loyalty to him. He brings a test upon the love we have professed. What shall we say to the charge he brings against us, if we claim by our profession to know him and yet do not "keep his commandments?" The question turns of loyalty to God or loyalty to the Catholic Church. The time for a decision is at hand. Christianity or Catholicity, which will you choose?
