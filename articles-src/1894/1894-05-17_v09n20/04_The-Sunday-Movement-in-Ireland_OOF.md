The spirit and animus of Sunday laws is not confined to the United States. Here in Ireland the same steps are being taken that have been traveled by the agitators in America. The Sabbath (Sunday) Observance Society is making itself felt in different ways. Through its influence twenty-four ministers of different denominations advertised to speak on the Sabbath question April 15. Large audiences were reported from many churches.

In behalf of the Sunday and the nature of its observance the witnesses did not seem fully to agree; but as it was with the witnesses against Christ they agreed that he was worthy of death, so these all agreed that Sunday must be kept. One argued for Sunday from the fourth commandment which teaches the observance of the seventh day, first stating that the Sabbath was changed with the sanction of the apostles; then afterward trying to prove that Christ changed it. But the burden of the whole argument seemed to be to get the people into the church on Sunday. The special reasons given why such a general move was being made now was that the railroads and steamboats were offering inducements that would enable many to go on excursions.

Another minister said, "We will take it for granted the Sabbath was changed by the proper authority." Then he argued the strict observance of Sunday from the Sabbath law. The secretary of the society said he was not arguing as to which day was the Sabbath, but was simply presenting the laws regulating the Sabbath. He claimed a large share of the Sunday desecration was owing to the shops and stores keeping open late Saturday afternoon. Hence he would have Parliament enact laws shutting up places of business at a certain hour on Saturday afternoon. This would give the people time for recreation and other necessary work so that Sunday would be protected.

Of course this seems a very harmless kind of legislation. But where will the Sunday law advocates stop? They are not, and would not be, content with shutting up the shops and stores on Sunday unless they could in some way get the people to fill their churches. And so they would make laws infringing on the rights of men to carry on their business on another day of the week so that the employed may have time for excursions, recreation, etc., so they will be willing to attend church on Sunday.

From what I have seen here, however, enforced idleness means drunkenness, debauchery, and crime, instead of rest, development, and spirituality. There is but one way in which men can be brought to keep the Sabbath and that is to bring them to Christ. Circumstances may force men into outward conformity, but it is only the living Christ within that can give virtue to any act.
