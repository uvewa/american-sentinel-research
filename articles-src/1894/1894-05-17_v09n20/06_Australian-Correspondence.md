## Australian Correspondence.

THERE are organizations in existence and at work here for the purpose of enforcing the Sunday, and other like measures, the same as in America. We have the "Council of the Churches," the "Christian Electors' Association," the "Scripture Education League," the "Lord's Day Observance Society," and the "Anti-Sunday Traveling Society." They answer exactly to the National Reform Association, the American Sabbath Union, and the like over there. And they are beginning to be quite active. They are speaking out recently in no uncertain tones. In the language of Mr. H. H. George, they mean to show the Parliaments over here that these are Christian nations, or colonies rather. They are sending out circular letters to the electors, or voters, telling them how to vote. Yet they will assert in these very letters that they are "neither political nor ecclesiastical, in the limited sense of the term, but ethical." They boldly declare that they want the "balance of power" placed in the hands of the Christian element of the country. They are besieging the various premiers of the colonies to have Sunday entertainments and amusements stopped, as the churches cannot stand the competition. They say they want the present Sunday laws "vigorously enforced," and more of like legislation. The New South Wales Parliament has already acceded to their demand that Sunday concerts and amusements shall be stopped, though the premier of this colony, Sir George Dibbs, set up a deputation from the "Council of Churches" that recently waited on him praying against these things, in pretty good shape. Here is a little of the conversation that passed between them, as reported in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, of February 17, 1894:—

SIR GEORGE DIBBS. What is this Council of the Churches?

MR. WALKER. It is the representatives of the six largest Protestant denominations of the colony, the Anglisans, the Presbyterians, the Wesleyans, the Congregationalists, the Baptists, and the Primitive Methodists. It is desired that the Premier should enforce the law in regard to Sunday entertainments. A charge is being made for admission at the Alhambra and the Tivoli.

SIR GEORGE DIBBS. Have you been there?

MR. WALKER. No.

SIR GEORGE DIBBS. Where is the Tivoli?

MR. WALKER. I don't know.

Several members of the deputation: In Castlereagh Street.

SIR GEORGE DIBBS. Which of you was there last? A member of the deputation explained that they had got others to go there.

SIR GEORGE DIBBS. Oh!

MR. WALKER. These entertainments are of a secular character.

SIR GEORGE DIBBS. What do you call secular?

MR. WALKER. They are by no means sacred in any form. They are comic. And we have evidence that they sing parodies of sacred songs.

SIR GEORGE DIBBS. Have you been able to draw the line between secular and sacred music? I have made several attempts and failed.

Mr. Walker complained that it was a desecration of the British Sunday.

SIR GEORGE DIBBS. What is the British Sunday? I have heard of British beer, but not of British Sunday.

MR. WALKER. I think you know what it is.

SIR GEORGE DIBBS. I don't know what it is. Do you go to the two tables of stone for it?

MR. WALKER. Yes.

SIR GEORGE DIBBS. Then you are out of court.

After another discussion,—

SIR GEORGE DIBBS. You clergymen, you know, are too exacting; and because you are too exacting, the people are obliged to resort to these tricks (of advertising "free" and then charging an admission).

MR. WALKER. Do you think there is any great curtailment of liberties of the people of New South Wales?

SIR GEORGE DIBBS. You must recollect that you cannot make good people by Act of Parliament.

The Rev. Dill-Macky said they were afraid of a continental Sabbath. By and by they would want the law a little more stringent. Then they should be able to deal with the dancing saloons that open on Sunday.

From this it can be seen that we are likely to have as lively times over here soon as you have had in America.

How this treatment of this deputation is regarded by the religious press may be seen from the following quotation from the Australian Christian World, of February 22, 1894:—

A more miserable, pitiful, shuffling reception of an influential deputation could scarcely be imagined, yet it is only natural, from the simple fact that the Church is not recognized as a factor in politics. The churches of the land have taken no part in the political life of the country. The Church, as a Church, has no vote nor influence in Parliament, so it is simply sneered at by the premiers. Some of the remarks made by Sir George Dibbs were little short of blasphemous, such as, for instance, when Rev. John Walker said that such concerts as were being given in these places of amusement were a desecration of the British Sunday, the premier sneeringly said: "What is the British Sunday? I have heard of British beer, but not of British Sunday."

This will give you a little idea of what is in the wind here. The spirit of persecution is abroad in the land. Only last Sunday my nearest neighbor, a devout Presbyterian, got quite angry because my two children were playing in an open field back of our lot, in the sand with their little toy cars. He commanded them to go home, and threatened to whip them if they did not. When I went over to ask for an explanation of his course and find out who was supposed to have jurisdiction over my children, he said that if we stayed here we must keep the Sunday; and if these things were not stopped he would take measures to see that they were, and would make it "hot for us." Of course, I told him that this was not the Christian way of doing; that we observed the seventh day and expected to go about our business on Sunday the same as on other days; and that I thought we would get along all right if he would simply attend to his own affairs and not try to run the whole neighborhood. But this only illustrates the spirit that is being aroused as the witnesses for God's Sabbath begin to scatter out into the world preparatory to the last great conflict and struggle. The signs truly are thickening on every hand for the great battle.
