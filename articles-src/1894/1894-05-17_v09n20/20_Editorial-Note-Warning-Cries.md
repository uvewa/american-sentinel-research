IN NARRATING THE STRADE EVENTS WHICH WERE THE PROPRESSED STRADES OF THE BROCKINRIDGE SUNDAY BILL FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA; IT WAS PASSED BY AN AUXILIARY SOCIETY OF THE WOMAN'S CHRISTIAN TEMperance Union in the State of the United States, WHEN HE SUDDENLY STOPPED, SHRIEKED OUT—'Woe to myself!' and was struck dead by a stone."

In the "Great Controversy between Christ and Satan," the same incident is thus narrated:—

For seven years a man continued to go up and down the streets of Jerusalem, declaring the woes that were to come upon the city. By day and by night he chanted the wild dings, "A voice from the east; a voice from the west; a voice from the four winds; a voice against Jerusalem and the temple; a voice against the bridegroom and the bride; and a voice against all the people." This strange being was imprisoned and scourged; but no complaint escaped his lips. To insult and abuse he answered only, "Woe to Jerusalem! woe, woe to the inhabitants thereof!" His warning cry ceased not until he was slain in the siege he had foretold.

How many years shall not only one, but many, go up and down the streets and highways of this nation, their very condition, appearance, and presence, in itself, a louder and more insistent cry than that of the strange prophet of evil in Jerusalem, and yet the people not take warning? No, not even when the "General of the Army of the Commonwealth" speaks such words as these, which the Washington Post records,—in the Capitol City, at the head of the vanguard of the crusade of the 19th century:—

He said the occasion marked a crisis in the country that was little dreamed of. "This country," said he, "is like a big bunch of straw, and all that is necessary to start it into a roaring blaze is the torch. Do you dream that in court to-day the torch was applied? We came here as an army of peace. God knows violence is the last wish of any member of this army, but I fear that the match has been applied, and that time alone will tell what is to be the outcome. If violence does follow the consequences will not be on our heads, for others were the cause of it. It now looks to me as though it would be useless to try and accomplish anything more in the line of public reformation by peace."

Troy had its Cassandra, Jerusalem its Jesus, the son of Ananus, and the United States cannot afford to turn a deaf ear to the warning cries of the times, even though the voices which proclaim them are not pleasant to the ear.
