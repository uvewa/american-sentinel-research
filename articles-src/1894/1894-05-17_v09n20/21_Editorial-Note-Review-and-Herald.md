THE REVIEW AND HERALD IS THE CHURCH PAPER OF THE SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST DENOMINATION, AND IS THE oldest periodical published by that body. The editor-in-chief, Elder Uriah Smith, at the request of the Foreign Mission Board of the Seventh-day Adventists, is about to make an extended tour through Europe and Western Asia. He will attend important meetings in England, Scandinavia, Germany, and Switzerland, after which he will visit Rome, Greece, and possibly extend his tour to Palestine. While thus traveling over this historic ground, his ever-fruitful pen will still be busy in editorial work for the Review and Herald, and we bespeak for that paper an extensive circulation, especially during this time. As every one who is acquainted with Elder Smith knows, he is an earnest believer in the soon coming of Christ, and, while visiting these battle-fields of the Church of past ages, he will no doubt be able to draw many practical and important lessons for those who expect to pass through the final conflict, and stand ready to meet the Messiah at his second coming.

The Review and Herald is a 16 page weekly, and the subscription price $2.00 a year. Address all orders to the Review and Herald Publishing Company, Battle Creek, Mich.
