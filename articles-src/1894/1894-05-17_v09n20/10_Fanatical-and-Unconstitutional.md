## Fanatical and Unconstitutional.

Senator Gallinger has introduced a bill "to protect the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, as a day of rest and worship in the District of Columbia." As this bill was presented "by request," he is not responsible for its conception, which can be readily traced to its authors. Is it incumbent upon congressmen to waste time and exasperate freemen by presenting bills that are absolutely unconstitutional? Ought not the result of their last attempt to throttle liberty of conscience to suffice as an object lesson for at least two years? What good came of attempting to shut up the World's Fair on Sunday? The law was defied and Congress was slapped in the face, as it ever will be when fanaticism overrides reason and demands that we return to the intolerance of the Puritans.

"Congress shall make no laws respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," is the very First Amendment to a Constitution upon which this Republic is based; yet cranks in trousers and in petticoats ever and anon do demand now that God be put into the Constitution, and now that the District of Columbia, which is at the mercy of men who pay taxes elsewhere, shall be subjected to religious legislation. Have we no Hebrews among us? No second Adventists? No agnostics? So long as public peace is preserved, what business has Congress to mind the business of the people of this District? Listening to fanatics, legislators have driven cats from their stands on Sunday against the wishes of both drivers and the public, the latter of whom are sadly inconvenienced. Pursued to its logical end this tyranny would stop horse and cable cars as well. Why should cats be more impious than cars?

Senator Gallinger's Senate bill 1628 has been referred to the District Commissioners. In the name of liberty and the Constitution, I protest against the bill that insults both. Let the commissioners open their Bibles, and, turning to the second chapter and sixteenth verse of Colossians, read Paul's excellent advice: "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holy day, or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath days."

Behold the tolerance of a Christianity that its bigoted professors refuse to follow. Are these bigots disciples of Calvin? Then let me tell them that Calvin would repudiate such unworthy followers. What was his counsel to his students? "Observe the Sabbath day, but if any man says to you, you must keep it, then break it as a token of your Christian liberty."

I commend St. Paul and Calvin to the attention of the three Commissioners of the District of Columbia.—Kate Field's Washington.
