THE following is the last recorded resolution in favor of the congressional passage of Sunday laws for the District of Columbia; it was passed by an auxiliary society of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union in Washington:—

WHEREAS the Christian sentiment of this community has recently again been insulted and shocked by the not only irreverent but blasphemous manner in which Robert G. Ingersoll, on Sunday, has spoken in an open theatre, and for gain, an admission of from one dollar to one dollar and fifty cents being charged. Therefore,

Resolved, That we appeal officially to the Senate committee of this District of Columbia, asking a full and favorable report of the bill to the Senate that its passage may be secured this session.

The Woman's Christian Temperance Union of the District was very zealous in furthering the cause of the Breckinridge Sunday bill for the District of Columbia when it was before the House Committee on the District.
