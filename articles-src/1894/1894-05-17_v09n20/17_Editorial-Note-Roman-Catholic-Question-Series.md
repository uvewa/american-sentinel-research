WITH this issue the series of articles on the Roman Catholic question is resumed. The following are some of the subjects which will be treated,—Justification, is it by Penance, or by Faith? Christ or the Immaculate Conception, Which? The Real Presence, Where and How is it Manifested? The Head of the True Church, Christ or the Pope, Which? Infallibility; is it in Christ alone, or in the Pope, Which?

In reality the subject and thought of this series has not been materially broken, because, of the five issues which have intervened, only one has contained a leading article which varied in its line of thought from the discussion of the subject of Roman Catholicism as previously promised. Those who have read with care the leading articles in Nos. 15, 16, 17 and 18, of the dates of April 12, 19, 26 and May 3, will realize that the subject has not been allowed to drop, and that although the form of its presentation has been changed somewhat in these numbers the matter is equally valuable, and in reality properly introductory to that which is to follow.
