LONDON DISPATCHES, OF MAY 2, SAY, "The Church Patronage Bill, introduced by George C. T. Bartley (Conservative), passed its second reading in the House of Commons to-day. The bill stops the sale of the next presentations to church living, places restrictions upon all sales of church livings, and empowers bishops to prevent improper persons from being instituted in the benefices.

"The Radicals opposed the bill as aiming to hide scandal instead of extirpating it. They contended that the proper remedy is disestablishment.

"Sir William Harcourt, Liberal leader, did not oppose the bill, as he regarded it a step in the right direction."
