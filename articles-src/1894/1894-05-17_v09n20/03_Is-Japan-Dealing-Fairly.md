The silver wedding of the emperor was observed with due ceremony and eclat, on the ninth of March, notwithstanding the unfavorable condition of the weather. When the emperor rode out to review the troops the empress rode in the same carriage with him. This is the second time in the history of the nation when such a thing has been done. The first-time was on the promulgation of the constitution. It is to be presumed that in both instances the act was intended to show to the outside world the adoption of foreign usages by the court, and to exhibit the advance made by Japan in the civilization of the nineteenth century. The act calls our attention to the constitution, and to a recent incident which may perhaps indicate the real value of at least one portion of that document. The twenty-eighth article reads as follows:—

Japanese subjects shall, within limits not prejudicial to peace or order, and not antagonistic to their duties as subjects, enjoy freedom of religious belief.

The Christian world has spoken very favorably of this article of the constitution, and has inferred and hoped very much from it. When looked at closely, especially the part I have italicized, it will be seen that the "freedom" may very easily be set aside by "the powers that be." It would not be difficult to insist on kinds of obedience that would instantly take away and utterly destroy all freedom of religious belief.

The incident that illustrates the present working and value of this article, number twenty-eight of the constitution, is this: A verbal command has recently gone out from "A Prince of the Blood," who is the commanding officer of the chief and related garrisons in a certain part of Japan, that all the soldiers who are Christians must give up their Christianity. In one of the garrisons a dozen or so of the rank and file, and a few officers, are Christians. The men have decided that they must perforce obey the order as to outward appearance, hence half a dozen of them have already asked that their names be erased from the church register. The remaining half-dozen will do the same very shortly. They did not make the request in a body, I am told, lest the few Christians remaining in the church should be too much disheartened and the church broken up. The men affirm that they have no intention of giving up their faith, but they feel constrained to give up the open profession of their religion. In another of the garrisons all the Christians, with the exception of one who is at present resolute in holding out for his right to religious liberty under the constitution, have asked to have their names erased from the church register.

No one has heard that the Shinto and Buddhist soldiers have been ordered to give up their religion. The discrimination is solely against the Christians. The verbal command required secrecy as well as apostasy, but in the nature of the case it was rather difficult to enforce the former. The Japanese pastors whose work is directly affected by this despotic command are deeply stirred by it, and it is probable that they will make it public through the press. This is certainly the most flagrant act of tyranny that I have heard of for some time, although acts of a kindred nature have been altogether too common since, as well as before, the promulgation of the constitution.

On inquiry I find that it is practically in the power of heads of departments to exercise a good deal of tyranny in this and in other matters, too. It is generally understood that students in the government normal schools, and in fact, all persons in government service, are forbidden to have any thing to do with politics or political assemblies; but I am not aware of any such public prohibition in religious matters. As the case now stands, it seems that if the principal of a school happens to be a Christian, or friendly to Christianity, the students are at liberty to attend Christian services, or to become professing Christians; otherwise their liberty is taken from them. The same is true of the common schools where there is a head and under teachers. If the principal is opposed to Christianity, the under teachers are given to understand that they are to have nothing to do with it. If they refuse to obey, their services are soon dispensed with, but never because they are Christians! I am told that the same is true of the teachers—who are nearly always men—and the school children they have to teach. If the teacher is antichristian, the scholars are notified that they must let Christianity alone. If they disobey, school life is made very uncomfortable for them. This accounts very largely for the difficulty experienced in reaching the children. Sunday-schools do not flourish. The reasons given to the children by antichristian teachers is that Christianity is a foreign religion, and that it is antagonistic to the best interests of the country. The children accept the statement as true—as a matter of course—and then tell what they have learned to their parents, who in turn become more difficult to reach. This accounts, in part at least, for the present and very general lack of interest among the people in Christian preaching.

I am told that the chief of any and all departments, military, civil, legal, educational or what not, exercise at their discretion this arbitrary authority in allowing or forbidding a variety of things. The authority is said to be extra legal or lawless, yet it is exercised as though it were properly delegated and employed. It is not easy to imagine that the highest authorities are ignorant of this assumption and arbitrary use of power. It must be assumed that for reasons best known to themselves, they choose to wink at it. The Government of Japan may be said to tolerate Christianity, but it can hardly be said that it encourages it. A fair front is put on before the outside world, but behind this choice lacquer of appearance there is the silent allowance—or possibly worse—of the unfairness, injustice, and tyranny already mentioned. Is Japan dealing fairly with her own subjects in allowing such a state of things? Is she dealing honorably with the enlightened nations in whose presence she is making such an outward show of having attained, or almost attained, to the highest summit of nineteenth century civilization?

If foreign merchants were hampered in such ways as these named in this article in their business relations with native merchants, would they be apt to remain perpetually silent? Would they not, instead of this, take immediate and forcible action in bringing the matter to the attention of the highest authorities through their national representatives?

Should Christian workers be any less earnest and energetic in endeavoring to remove any and all impediments to the progress and success of their business?

Can Japan be said to be dealing fairly either with its own subjects or with the Treaty Powers while "the government" allows officials, high or low, large or small, to exercise such discretionary and despotic power over the religious liberty of those under them as the commanding officer already named has exercised, and as others are and have been exercising in other departments of the national service?—Rev. J. L. Atkinson, in Independent.
