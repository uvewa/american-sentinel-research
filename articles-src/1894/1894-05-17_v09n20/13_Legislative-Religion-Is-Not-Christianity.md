# Legislative Religion Is Not Christianity.

We deny, absolutely deny, the right of any civil power to legislate, directly or indirectly, regarding anything pertaining to religion, especially here in these United States. The majority may rule in civil things, but God alone should rule the hearts of men and the affairs concerning his worship.

There has been more blood shed and crime caused by religious—not Christian—laws and religious jealousies than from all other causes combined.

The religion which cannot be sustained without the aid of civil law is not the religion of Jesus, it is not Christianity.—Our Prison Light.
