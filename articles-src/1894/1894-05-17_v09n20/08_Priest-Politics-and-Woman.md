At the Woman's Suffrage mass meeting, held in the great hall of Cooper Union, New York City on the evening of Monday, May 7, a Roman Catholic priest, Father Ducey, is reported as expressing himself thus, by the New York World, with a few comments as to the effect of his words:

"We hear it said by these Protestants—I am a Catholic, as you know, and I am opposed both to Protestants and protestants—that if women voted, then suffrages would be used by the Catholic Church to fasten its hold upon the nation."

"The priest came to the edge of the platform, and, flinging up his hand, cried: 'That's a lie!' In the whirlwind that came then the tinkle of a glass from his pince-nez was lost, but the glass was not. It's bounced down on a reporter's copy and was handed back.

"The Catholic Church has elevated woman, and non-Catholic women will bear me out in this. The church has put a woman in her dearest and purest and holiest embodiment among the Godhead."

"There was a timorous handclapping at this.

"'She has put Mary, the mother of Jesus, and, as I believe, the mother of God, side by side with our Redeemer and our redeeming Brother.'

"Hisses mingled with applause. Approval strengthened. They who indorsed what the priest had said strove with those whose religious prejudices were opposed to the honor paid to the mother of Jesus. Approval won, though it took long to do it. The incident had its significance to those who remember that the heaviest vote polled at those school elections where women have the ballot has been called out when religious prejudice was a campaign issue."
