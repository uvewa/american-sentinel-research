PORTSCHESTER, N. Y., is rejoicing in a full blown Law and Order League which, on Sunday, May 6, began its work with the Sunday closing of all the saloons. After a six days' relapse into common every day immorality it will again arouse and, not only close the saloons on Sunday, but make up for allowing the saloons to do business six days of the week by the Sunday closing also of ice cream saloons, barber shops, and drug stores. Of the effect of the Sunday crusade on the saloons the New York World says:—

The result of the closing up in Portchester was to make a flourishing trade for the livery men. All who could afford the luxury drove to Harrison, where there is no license and evidently no excise law. Others walked to East Portchester, in Connecticut, and soon found their way to the side doors.

Is such a result as this a victory for true religion? Certainly not. Where there is no true religion, either in the methods or motives, there certainly will not be in the results.
