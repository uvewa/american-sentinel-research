The following, from the Newark Catholic Register, if it suggests a contrast, also marks notably the harmony of action among Roman Catholics and so-called Protestant denominations. The Register says:—

A Methodist clergyman of Newark, in his usual Sunday evening discourse to his people last Sunday, took occasion to state that the lately elected mayor of the city is of his creed, and, incidentally, to express a hope of good government on that account. In which there was certainly no great harm, and probably no harm at all.

At the Congregationalist Conference a few days later, Rev. Mr. Scudder, of Jersey City, spoke in favor of developing still further the attractive and enter-taining features of church membership, and in particular mentioned military drills for the young as one to be encouraged. A very good idea, say we, not only innocuous, but positively beneficial and useful.

Not a priest in the diocese of Newark will say from his altar next Sunday that the Methodists are mixing their religion and politics, nor that the Congregationalists are arming to overthrow the Republic. Yet every Roman Catholic elected to office serves certain pulpit pessimists as a welcome illustration of the dangerous political power of Rome, and should his election be mentioned by a priest to his people, the fact would be proclaimed throughout the land as conclusive evidence of evil designs on the part of the pope. This very Mr. Scudder was engaged a short time ago in a controversy with Rev. Hugh P. Fleming, of Orange, which controversy grew out of some other minister's attack upon the Catholic Church, in the course of which the drilling at Seton Hall College was denounced as preparation for waging war upon the commonwealth at the order of the pope. That minister will not say a word against the young Congregationalists' arming and drilling, of course, but neither will any priest say a word in opposition to the suggestion. As no man knows how soon skill in arms may be needed by the sons of the Republic, none but its enemies or the insane would decry military training.

The contrast between the dignified bearing of our Catholic priests towards those who differ with them on religion and the little fellows who are forever seeking an opportunity to bowl about Roman Catholic ascendency, is made to appear very plain by such happenings as the aforesaid. It is one of the things that goes to show that ours is the church of charity, the true Church of God.

The contrast is very clear. The point made is a good one, and undeniable. Why is it that not a priest raises his voice to accuse the different denominations of ulterior motives in this reprehensible military organization of the youth in the Sunday schools? It is because the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church know that these Protestant organizers are ignorantly forwarding a great Roman Catholic propaganda,—that they are, unawares, working in harmony with those whom they ignorantly think they oppose. The motives are in perfect harmony; the contrast is in the fact that the one is intelligently doing what the other is ignorantly assisting to further.
