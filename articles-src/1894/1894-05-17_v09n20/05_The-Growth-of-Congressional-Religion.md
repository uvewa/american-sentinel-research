The progress of the spirit of formal religion in Congress is evidenced by this debate, which took place in the House of Representatives on April 30. The extract is from pp. 5152-53, of the Congressional Record, May 1:—

The Clerk read as follows:—

That with the view of increasing the facility for religious instruction in the army, the council of administration, at a post where there is no chaplain, is authorized to employ a minute r of the gospel, for the purpose of religious instruction at said post, the total expenditure at each post for such purpose not increased $1,500 per minute, and no further appointment s of chaplains in the army shall be made until the total number is reduced below twenty.

Mr. Pickler and Mr. Bowers, of California, rose.

Mr. Bowers, of California, obtained the floor.

MR. PICKLER. I desire to reserve a point of order on this provision.

MR. BOWERS, of California I make a point of order on this paragraph. I do not care to argue the question, but will simply state it. By Rule XXI. it is provided:—

Nor shall any provision in any such bill or amendment thereto changing existing law be in order, except such as, being germane to the subject-matter of the bill, shall retrench expenditures by the reduction of the number and salary of the officers of the United States, by the reduction of the compensation of any person paid out of the treasury of the United States, or by the reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill.

Now, I submit that this provision is not in line with either of the three requirements of this rule. It does not retrench expenditure in any one of the three ways which the rule contemplates. It does not reduce the number of employees, nor their compensation, nor the amount appropriated in the bill. In no sense can it be proper legislation upon this bill. In effect, it provides for the appointment of sixty two additional officers whose yearly salary will amount to over $90,000, with other allowances amounting to nearly as much. Thus this provision largely increases the amount to be appropriated hereafter by increasing the number of these officers. I do not care to discuss the matter.

THE CHAIRMAN. The Chair sustains the point of order.

MR. WHEELER, of Alabama. Will not the Chair hear the other side?

THE CHAIRMAN. The Chair is not obliged to hear the other side; but as a matter of courtesy will withdraw its decision and hear the gentleman.

MR. WHEELER, of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, this amendment reduces the number of officers, and therefore is not subject to the point of order.

Any amendment is in order under Rule XXI., which to use the words of the rule—

shall retrench expenditures by the reduction of the number and salary of officers of the United States.

This paragraph of the bill does reduce the number of chaplains in the army from thirty-four to twenty.

The gentleman is quite mistaken as to the expenses which may be incurred under this provision. It simply authorizes the employment of certain persons at a compensation not exceeding $1,500 a year for any post. Some large posts have a great many soldiers; but however large the post the compensation of the person employed is not to exceed $1,500. At some of the smaller posts the expenditure will probably not exceed $50 or $60 a year, and may be even less, and at many of the posts there would be no expenditure at all.

There is nothing in the bill whatever to show that the expenditures would exceed more than two or three thousand dollars, which would manifestly be a great saving when we consider the number of officers that are dispensed with by the adoption of this provision in the bill.

Now, Mr. Chairman, this amendment was suggested by the changed condition of the country: the army posts are now being surrounded by civilization; the frontier is a thing of the past, and at most of the army posts the necessity for having permanent chaplains has ceased to exist. Is it not better for posts near cities for the council of administration to be authorized to employ ministers to visit these posts and preach, and also to visit the sick and dying, than to retain permanent chaplains? A Catholic soldier, for instance, when he is dying, prefers to see a Catholic priest and certainly he does not want a Presbyterian minister, or a minister of any other denomination to come and administer to him, no matter how good such minister may be, and a soldier who has been reared in the Protestant religion would, of course, prefer to see a minister of his own faith.

MR. BOWERS, of California. Even if he is the chaplain of the post.

MR. WHEELER, of Alabama. My contention is that at posts which are surrounded by civilization, and where the services of ministers of the various denominations can be secured, it would be better to have ministers of different denominations preach from time to time than to have the same chaplain every Sunday for four years.

MR. HOPKINS, of Illinois. Will the gentleman allow a question?

MR. WHEELER, of Alabama. Yes.

MR. HOPKINS, of Illinois. The gentleman does not mean to convey the impression, I presume, that a Catholic priest would not be admitted to any post now to administer to a dying Catholic soldier under existing law?

MR. WHEELER, of Alabama. No, by no means; but I think there should be some provision to pay his expenses for going there. Take a man from Fort Sheridan, for instance, or any post near a city—

MR. HOPKINS, of Illinois. No minister of the gospel or priest under such conditions would ask to be remunerated. He regards it as a part of his duty.

MR. WHEELER, of Alabama. But does not the gentleman think it better for a great Government like ours to pay the expenses incurred by good ministers in travelling to and from posts rather than have them pay their own expenses? Ministers are generally poor—

MR. HOPKINS, of Illinois. Well, make provision for them if you want to, but keep the chaplains in the posts.

MR. WHEELER, of Alabama. There will be enough chaplains left for all the posts on the frontiers, where they can not have the facilities that I have suggested.

MR. PICKLER. Then why do you want more chaplains?

MR. WHEELER, of Alabama. The bill does not provide for any more chaplains. I have just stated that at some of the frontier posts they ought to have chaplains, because at those distant points there are no ministers sufficiently near to visit the posts. Therefore the services of a chaplain are necessary, and the bill retains twenty chaplains for posts of that character.

But take a place like Governor's Island, or Fort Hamilton, N. Y. Arrangements could be made in advance so as to secure the services of eminent firmes to preach at those posts at times when they happened to be in New York. They could be paid a moderate sum and would be entertained by some officer at the post, and a sermon by an eminent preacher will call out every soldier and officer and everyone else at the post and would do a great deal of good. Distinguished ministers like to preach to such congregations and would readily accept such invitations.

The churches at the seaside resorts are nearly all kept up in that manner.

A committee of the church correspond with ministers of great note and in that way arrange to have one eminent divine preach one Sunday and another the next, and so on through the season. They pay them about $50, and one of the vestry entertains the minister at his house.

The chaplain at West Point is a very excellent, cultivated, and eloquent gentleman, but all will admit that it is a pretty hard task for him to preach in the same pulpit week after week and year after year all his life, and it would be a great relief for him to have a distinguished minister to take his pulpit alternate Sundays, and the most distinguished ministers of Europe and America would gladly accept invitations to preach to the cadets. Young men like cadets are the kind of people great preachers like to impress.

MR. BOWERS, of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise to a question of order. I believe the only point before the committee is the point of order. Not the merits of the case. That is not before the committee now. It is the point of order on the paragraph.

MR. WHEELER, of Alabama. My friend himself argued the merits, and I was only replying to him.

But I insist that the point of order can not be sustained against the paragraph on the ground the gentleman alleges, because as a matter of fact it reduces the number of chaplains to twenty.

- MR. BOWERS, of California. When?

MR. WHEELER, of Alabama. As fast as vacancies occur; and there is nothing in the bill to provide that it shall not commence at once.

MR. BOWERS, of California. Do I understand from the gentleman's view that no appointments are to be made until the number of chaplains is reduced below twenty?

MR. WHEELER, of Alabama. They can, under this provision of law, have the chaplains or ministers from the neighboring churches to come to the post.

MR. BOWERS, of California. But this provides for chaplains at every post. Now, there are ninety-eight of these posts, and we must increase the number by sixty-two in order to provide for them.

MR. WHEELER, of Alabama. The gentleman, certainly, did not read the bill properly. It authorizes the employment of ministers and does not create more chaplains. I think the limit of $1,300 ought to be reduced, and we could very properly incorporate a proviso in the bill that in no event should the expense incurred exceed the amount now paid to chaplains. This would fully answer the gentleman's objections.

One expense of permanent chaplains my friend has overlooked. The retired chaplains are becoming very numerous. The number of chaplains now on the retired list are more than half as great as the entire active list.

THE CHAIRMAN. The Chair sustains the point of order, and rules out the paragraph excepted to.

In this case, therefore, the Government did not commit itself to further facilitating religious instruction in the army by appropriation of public money.
