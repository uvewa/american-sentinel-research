"THE POPE," says the Catholic Review, "has once more instructed the Catholics of France that it is their duty to accept the republic." Just so; and when the French Catholics have accepted the republic, because the pope tells them to do so, where will their highest civil allegiance be—in the pope or in the republic? Suppose the pope were to subsequently tell them that they ought to restore the empire, where would their allegiance be then? Had it not been for the pope and his impudent assumption of the right to depose kings and to set up kings, the Catholics of France never would have been, as a whole, opposed to the republic.
