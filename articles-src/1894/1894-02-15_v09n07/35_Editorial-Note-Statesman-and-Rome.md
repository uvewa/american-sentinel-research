Welcome Tidings, published at Louisville, Ky., says that the Christian Statesman, which "for many years has been one of the most powerful allies of the Roman Catholic Church in America," "openly confesses its own mistakes, and severing its union of purpose with Romanism for modeling constitutions and shaping legislation in the interest of the ecclesiastical power, now declares: 'The government that cherishes the papacy is cherishing a viper that will some day sting it to the heart.'"

This is only partially true. The Statesman, fired with jealousy at seeing Rome enter upon an inheritance of governmental power which it meant should be wielded in the interests of so-called Protestantism, denounced Rome, but made neither confession of past wrongs nor promises of future reformation. "Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone."
