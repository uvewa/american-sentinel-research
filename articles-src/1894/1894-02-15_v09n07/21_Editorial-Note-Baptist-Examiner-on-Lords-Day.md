THE Examiner (Baptist) has in its issue of the 6th inst., an article, the design of which is to show that Baptists are not consistent in demanding a "thus saith the Lord," a clear and definite command for everything. Of those who insist upon a plain command, the Examiner says:—

They are fatally inconsistent. They do not follow their own rule of conduct, they abandon their professed principle in many things, and have recourse to it only when they wish to oppose something that they do not like. There is no statute law for the observance of the Lord's day. There is statute law for the observance of the Sabbath; there is New Testament precedent for the observance of the Lord's day; but unless the later precedent be admitted as of equal authority with the statute and so modifying it, all Christendom (with exceptions insignificant in numbers) is guilty of a weekly violation of the fourth commandment.

What a confession! "There is no statute law for the observance of the Lord's day. There is statute law for the observance of the Sabbath." And because Baptists are unscrupulous in this they ought not to be too particular in other things! The Catholics say, "The Bible and tradition;" the Baptist Examiner says, "The Bible and custom;" and in this case it says, "Custom rather than the Bible." How are Baptists fallen!
