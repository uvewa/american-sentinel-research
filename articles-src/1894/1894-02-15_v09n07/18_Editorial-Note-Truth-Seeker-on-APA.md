The Truth Seeker does not like the American Protective Association much better than it does Romanism. It says:—

To the close and fair observer it appears that the American Protective Association has just one object—to put and keep Catholics out of office and to put and keep Protestants in office. Instead of opposing the Catholic Church at the points where it antagonizes liberty, the American Protective Association is in politics for the spoils, using opposition to "Roman influence" as its deceptive rallying cry. It represents and includes the most bigoted and unthinking elements of Protestantism, intent on establishing a Protestant State Church. Its papers which come to this office are as fanatical and less reasonable than the Christian Statesman, and surpass in bigotry all other religious papers—Catholic and Protestant—that we see.

This is as nearly as possible an unbiased opinion, for one does not need to more than glance at the first-page cartoon in the Truth Seeker to learn that it hates Rome as cordially as a plant loves light. But we can scarely agree with what is said about the Christian Statesman. We have ourselves regretted that the American Protective Association did not make its fight upon a different basis; but are not persuaded that its case is hopeless. The National Reformers, however, are joined to their idol.
