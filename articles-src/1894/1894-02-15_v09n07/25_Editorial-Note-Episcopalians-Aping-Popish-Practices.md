A ROMISH paper notes with intense satisfaction the aping of popish practices by high church Episcopalians in this city, and adds:—

Nor is the Episcopal Communion the only Protestant body which is restoring the once discarded Catholic beliefs and practices. At a recent conference of Presbyterian ministers in Glasgow, Scotland, the Rev. Dr. Hamilton urged that the practice of praying for the dead, "which had fallen into disuse in the church," should be resumed. His remarks were well received by the assemblage, and warmly indorsed by the Rev. Drs. Cooper and Macleod.

This is not surprising; we may expect to see more and more of such things, Protestantism has rejected the word of God and has turned to tradition, and will prolong land bodily in spirituism, which is simply another name for saint worship. But the Lord says: "Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish." Ps. 146; 3, 4. Could folly be greater than praying either for the dead or to the dead?
