JANUARY 25 and 26, there was held in Philadelphia a "National Conference for Good City Government," at which some significant things were said, among them was this by Rev. J. H. Ecob, of Albany, this State:

When I say now that the first business of the Church is to redeem the ballot and put it to the uses of the kingdom we have the total significance of the Church in all its characteristics and relations back of us, pressing imperatively to the conclusion.

What is the ballot? The fairest fruit of our Christian civilization. What is the ballot? It is the final utterance of a man. It is your manhood come to blossom. There you are focused in one intense expression in this divine order of government. Will not all Christian men then vote together solidly in regiments—an army equipped with that last, best, God's armature?

The sole issue is, shall this small civic body, the municipality, whose only business is with simple housekeeping economics, be given into good hands or bad hands? Shall this small family live was defully or conservatively? Shall they live in cleanliness or filth? Shall the men of the kingdom of heaven divide into feeble warring factions, while the sons of Belial, political brigands, actual murderers, thieves and all-around villains march into the offices of power?

"His entire argument," says the Mail and Express, from which we quote, "was that without the Church absolutely nothing could be done; and he ended by saying that to the shame of the Church it was not doing half that it should." This is only advocating government by a hierarchy. It is simply declaring that there should be a Church party and that office-holding should be confined to members of that party.
