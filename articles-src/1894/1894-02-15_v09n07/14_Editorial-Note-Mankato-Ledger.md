Some of our exchanges don't like our attitude toward the Roman Catholic Church. The Mankato Ledger says:—

The Ledger would like to remark to the AMERICAN SENTINEL, that it inclines to the belief that its degeneration from the proud attitude of a stalwart exponent of religious liberty, and liberty of Sunday observance, to a fanatical assailant of the Catholic Church, and its clergy is not in unison with what its name implies. It breathes a spirit of intemperance and intolerance that would do credit to the early days of religious persecutions, and is not at all in consonance with the enlightenment and intelligence that is supposed to exist in this day and age.

We are not wholly indifferent to the opinions of our contemporaries; we are not, however, running the SENTINEL to please them, but to tell the truth about "the mystery of iniquity," about the papal beast and its image; and this we must do whether men will hear or whether they will forbear.
