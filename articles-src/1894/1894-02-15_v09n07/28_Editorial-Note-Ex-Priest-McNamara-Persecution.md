A MISSOURI paper says that "Ex-Priest McNamara, who lectured in Kansas City against Romanism and who was mobbed by hundreds of ruffians, has just been tried by the courts and sentenced to pay a fine of $500, and be confined in the county jail for one year." As we understand the matter the ex-priest's offense was exposing the abominations of Rome. And "this is the land of the free," and freedom of "speech and of the press" is guaranteed by constitutional law, both State and national!
