"The State of Iowa has a whisky rebellion on her hands," says the Voice, "and it is proposed that she end the rebellion by conceding everything the rebels ask. Such advice is treason to the State. Let the rebels yield to the law of the State before any proposition to change it is even listened to." And yet thousands of Christian people, in fact a whole denomination styling itself the "Christian Church," contends that man's rebellion against God was settled in just the way it is proposed to settle the whisky rebellion in Iowa, namely, by repealing the law. And why do they take such a position?—Simply to get rid of the Sabbath of the Lord that they may exalt a man-made institution in its stead.
