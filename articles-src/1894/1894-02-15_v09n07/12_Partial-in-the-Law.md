When upon earth our Lord was asked: "Master, which is the great commandment in the law?" Christ's answer was: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." But men now imagine themselves wiser than our Lord, and so in the annual convention of the Iowa Sabbath Rest Association, held at Marshalltown, Iowa, Dec. 14 and 15, 1893, the Rev. H. H. George, of the American Sabbath Union, in an address on "Sabbath Reform," discriminates between the commandments in a way that our Lord refused to do, and said:—

It is a greater sin to violate the fourth commandment than any other one of the Decalogue. It is as much greater than the sixth or eighth as the commandment itself is greater. There are only four words in "Thou shalt not kill," while there are ninety-five words in the Sabbath commandment; hence to break the Sabbath is ninety-one times greater.

The enormity of this statement will be better understood when it is remembered that by violation of the fourth commandment Mr. George means not observing Sunday!! "Ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the Lord of hosts. Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law. Mal. 2:8, 9.
