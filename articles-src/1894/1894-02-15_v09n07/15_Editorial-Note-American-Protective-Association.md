One of our National Reform exchanges doesn't like the American Protective Association because in a recent document sent out "by those in a position to speak with authority," this question was asked:—

Will the Protestant ministers in general wake up from their lethargy before it is too late? or will they continue to work hand in hand with the Protestant National Reform Association and with the Romans, to establish a national religion, to their final disappointment and discredit, and let the American Protective Association fight the battle for American principles, and for liberty? or will they like true spiritual advisers join the American Protective Association in the good work?

The question is pertinent and does not afford any reason why National Reformers should take offense. But it is the truth that hurts. Apostate Protestants of the National Reform school can't bear to be told the truth about their traitorous surrender of Protestant principles. They have dubbed themselves, "The best people of the land," "the law-abiding people of the land," "Christian patriots," etc., etc., ad nauseum, and they don't like to have any body dispute their right to such titles.
