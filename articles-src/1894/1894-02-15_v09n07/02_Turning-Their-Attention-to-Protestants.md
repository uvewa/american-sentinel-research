THE Northwestern Chronicle (Roman Catholic) has the following, relative to the plan of campaign for the "conversion" of Protestants:—

The so-called "Paulist idea" of preaching the gospel to everybody has been taken up by Fathers Cress, of Bowling Green, Ohio, and Wonderly, of North Baltimore. Beginning in a town of only two Catholic families among some thousands of inhabitants, they first stated the Christian rule of faith and the Christian rule of life and having invited questions and free discussion were kept busy solving difficulties and refuting objections for about an hour. These turned chiefly on the invocation of saints, the infallibility of the church, and the baptism of infants. The Methodist minister had announced a special prayer-meeting for that evening, but finding his congregation altogether too small he concluded to follow his parishioners to the Catholic meeting. The priests were thanked by a unanimous vote of the gathering for their services and requested to come again.

And why not? If Rome is simply "one of the grand divisions of the Redeemer's army," as many "Protestants" now maintain, why not as well be a Catholic as a Methodist or a Presbyterian?
