On another page we publish an article from the New York Observer, on "Rome and the Schools." The Observer does not agree with the Independent that if the Roman Catholics "had the power to blot the public school system entirely out of existence and leave education to voluntary effort, they would not do so." The Observer believes that "the prelates and priests of the Romish Church, would, if they could, blot out of existence our system of public education," but that "there is no danger, provided Protestants do not lapse into indifference." We cannot share this confidence. The schools must be wholly and consistently secular or they must eventually become sectarian. Indeed as between Romanists and Protestants very many of our public schools are now sectarian in that they give religious instruction not common to both parties. Schools that use the King James Version of the Scriptures and Protestant hymns are to that extent Protestant, and strengthen the claims of the papists to a share of the school funds that they may maintain their separate schools. There is danger in "Protestant" inconsistency as well as in "Protestant" indifference.
