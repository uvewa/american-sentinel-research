THE Pacific Press still has on hand a few copies of the pamphlet, "The World in the Church; a Plain Statement of Facts," by Rev. John T. Sawyer, D.D., of the Louisiana Conference, of the Methodist Episcopal Church South. This pamphlet is "an appeal to Southern Methodists for a return to the 'old paths'." Of course incidentally it is a confession of the fallen condition of the churches. Price 25 cents.
