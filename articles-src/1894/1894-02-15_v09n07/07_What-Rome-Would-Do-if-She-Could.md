[The following editorial from the Catholic Standard of January 13, needs no comment. It shows how long freedom of the press would exist in America if Rome had her way.]

In its issue of January 3, that notorious and infamous sheet, Puck, publishes a cartoon, so grossly insulting to Catholics that we shall be greatly surprised if some action be not taken by the District-Attorney, of New York, to punish its proprietors, and prevent the repetition of similar offenses against the peace of the community. The cartoon represents the Catholic Church as a cat in its various stages of growth until it becomes a fierce and murderous tiger with its claws on the prostrate forms of a public-school boy and his mother, who has around her waist a belt on which is inscribed the word "Liberty."

We have no hesitation in declaring this cartoon to be diabolical both in conception and execution, and it could have been published with no other motive than to incite to riot and bloodshed. The great body of the intelligent and conservative American public, however, irrespective of creed, understand their Catholic fellow-citizens too well, and esteem them too highly, to be so easily provoked to break the laws of God and of the land as these human devils imagine, and, thank God, Catholics no longer pay much attention to the inflammatory attacks of ignorant tripots and hired assassins.

This does not relieve the authorities in New York, however, from discharging their duty in this particular instance. Let the Catholics of that city see to it that the proprietors of Puck are punished; and hereafter let no Catholic, who has the least spark of self-respect, ever be seen reading this disreputable sheet.
