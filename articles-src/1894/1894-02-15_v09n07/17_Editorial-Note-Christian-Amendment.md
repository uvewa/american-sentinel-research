REFERRING to the religious amendment to the Constitution, which has been introduced in both the Senate and the House, the Christian Reformer says:—

It will be referred to the judiciary committee, and then will come a hearing before that committee which will afford an opportunity for the discussion of the subject in such a national way as to give it commanding publicity. Then, if the judiciary committee will report the amendment, the issue will be fairly joined before the nation. And at that juncture Christian citizens should flood Congress with petitions for the passage of the amendment. We are hopeful that this stage of the great issue may be reached early in this present session of Congress.

The Reformer ought to know that the Supreme Court decision of February 29, 1892, was more far-reaching than the proposed amendment possibly could be. For all practical purposes the Constitution has been amended by the Supreme Court, and Congress has already enacted legislation in harmony with that amendment. The National Reformers are two years behind the times. Their so-called Christian amendment may serve to divert the attention of the people from the fact that the evil principle of governmental religion rather than individual piety has already been established, but it can serve no other purpose.
