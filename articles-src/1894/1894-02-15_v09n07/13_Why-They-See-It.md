The League for the Protection of American Institutions, so-called, has renewed its petition to Congress for the entire cessation of sectarian appropriations, and asks—

that the general Government now adopt a definite, permanent and uniform principle, in accord with the spirit of the United States Constitution, for advancing education among the Indians on the basis of the American free common school system, in order that the dangers involved in departure from the American principle of keeping separate and distinct the functions of Church and State be no more fostered by any actions of the general Government.

In presenting this petition the league states that—

the highest official bodies of the Congregational, the Methodist Episcopal, the Presbyterian and the Protestant Episcopal Churches have determined to withdraw their applications for funds from the United States Treasury, because of the principle which they now see is involved in this dangerous practice, and they propose henceforth to support their own schools without Government aid.

It is only just to all parties to state that the denominations named were enabled to "see" this by the fact that the Roman Catholics were getting the lion's share of the governmental appropriations. And it is not risking very much to hazard the opinion that Rome will still get the appropriations. The time for the "Protestants" to have stopped would have been before they began. They are now powerless to check the evil.
