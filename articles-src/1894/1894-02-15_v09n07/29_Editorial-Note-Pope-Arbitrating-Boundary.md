"PERU," says the Western Watchman, "has agreed to accept the pope's arbitration in the matter of the boundary line between that country and Ecuador." The pope is reaching out after political influence wherever he can secure it. When one applied to the Saviour saying unto him, "Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me," Jesus answered, "Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?" but the pope, the professed vicar of Christ, is always ready to officiate in such a capacity.
