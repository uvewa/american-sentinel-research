It is a part of the Hindoo religion not to take life; and the Hindoo views with horror the slaughter of animals for food. In Bohar, India, there has been for some time a strong anti-kine-killing agitation; and so intense has been the feeling that riot has resulted. The attention of the government has been called to the difficulty, and the Allahabad Pioneer remarks that "of course the agitation will be suppressed by the ordinary action of a strong government, and by the gradual recognition of the fact amongst the people that coercion of those who differ from them in religious matters is followed by unpleasant consequences to themselves." This is somewhat different from the course pursued in this country in such matters. Of course people here do not regard cattle as sacred, but they have a "sacred" day, and instead of restraining the people from forcing its observance upon those who do not regard it as sacred, the Government, State and national, lends its power to compel everybody to respect the day. But then the Hindoo are heathen while the devotees of Sunday are "Christians." But does that really affect the principle? Are not the Hindoo who insist that their ideas concerning the proper use of cattle must be respected by those who have no such ideas, and the "Christians" who demand of everybody a measure of Sunday observance whether they really regard the day or not, equally at fault? and are they not equally infringing the religious liberty of their fellow-men?
