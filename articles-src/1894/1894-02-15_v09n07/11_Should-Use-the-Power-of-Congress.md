As reported in an Iowa paper, Rev. H. H. George, of the American Sabbath Union, expressed himself as follows, in a Sunday convention held in that State last December:—

We are living in stirring times. We must cry aloud and put our shoulder to the wheel. We propose to stop this Sunday desecration. The Sunday trains are dependent upon the Sunday mails for support. Stop the trains, and that will stop the Sunday newspapers. All denominations of any note are now united in this movement, Catholic and all, and we have succeeded in getting the cooperation of all labor unions, temperance associations, and other societies, political and ecclesiastical, to unite in one solid move on the present Congress, to force them to pass a national Sunday law. We are prepared to make Congress understand that this is a Christian nation. We would be a set of fools to give up the battle now after gaining the victory over Congress in the World's Fair movement. We must have a Sabbath day as we want it. We have got to get out on the streets and cry, "Yet forty days, and we shall have law." Those who will not be persuaded to keep the Sabbath [Sunday] can be informed that they will be compelled to do so.

The States have Sunday laws, but this is not enough. We are going to have a national law, and I think I am sure we shall have it before the first session of this Congress is closed. Measures are now effected to besiege Congress with representative men from every organized body in the land, and they will not dare refuse us.

The church should use the power of Congress to control the sin of the nation, and if she does not do so, blood will be on her garments.

Mr. George is now in Washington working as a "Christian" lobbyist, wielding the power of the State in the interest of the Church.
