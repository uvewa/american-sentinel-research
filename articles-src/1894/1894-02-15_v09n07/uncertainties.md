# Uncertainties Log - American Sentinel v09n07 (1894-02-15)

## Masthead - Associate Editor Name

**Location:** Page 1, Masthead
**OCR output:** "CALVIN F. MOLLEAR"
**Corrected to:** "CALVIN P. BOLLMAN"
**Confidence:** HIGH
**Reason:** All other 1894 issues consistently list "Calvin P. Bollman" (or C. P. Bollman) as associate editor. "MOLLEAR" appears to be an OCR misreading. The actual text would show "BOLLMAN" with proper letter shapes.

## Article 25 - "prolong land bodily in spiritum"

**Location:** Page 7, Editorial Note on Protestants Adopting Catholic Practices
**OCR output:** "prolong land bodily in spiritum"
**Transcribed as:** "prolong land bodily in spirituism"
**Confidence:** MEDIUM
**Reason:** The phrase appears garbled in OCR. Context suggests this should read "plunge headlong into spirituism" (a common phrase warning about spiritualism/spiritism in religious literature of this period). However, transcribed OCR output as closely as possible while making minimal correction to "spirituism" from "spiritum."

## General Note

Overall OCR quality from Mistral is excellent. Most text transcribed cleanly with minimal obvious errors. Historical spellings like "to-day," "connexion," archaic capitalization, and period-specific phrases have been preserved exactly as they appear in the OCR output.
