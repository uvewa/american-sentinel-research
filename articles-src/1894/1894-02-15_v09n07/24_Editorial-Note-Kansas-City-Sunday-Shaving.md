CUSTOMERS can now be shaved on Sunday, in Kansas City, Mo., by signing the following statement:—

For the purpose of obtaining the services of the barber shop in the Midland Hotel on Sunday, I state that the service of a barber shop is a necessity to me at this time, and that my omission to obtain such service on Saturday was not through any fault or neglect on my part.

"The man who signs that statement will be shaved, and the man who doesn't sign it will not be shaved in my shop tomorrow," was the positive statement made by Manager Smith on a recent Saturday. The statement complies with the ruling of Judge Wofford in the criminal court.
