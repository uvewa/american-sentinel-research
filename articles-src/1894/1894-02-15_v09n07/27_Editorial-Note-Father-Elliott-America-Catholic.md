THE popish priest, "Rev. Father" Walter Elliott, of the Paulist "Fathers," who has recently returned from a "missionary" tour of certain districts of the West, gives it as his decided opinion that "America will be converted and made a Catholic country." And why not? through the instrumentality of the whole National Reform combination the Government is already committed to papal principles.
