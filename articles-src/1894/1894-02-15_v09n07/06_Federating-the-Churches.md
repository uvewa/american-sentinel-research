An effort has been made in various places to unite all the various "Protestant" churches in what is termed a "Federal Council." The following, from the State Republican, of January 18, Lansing, Mich., will serve to show what the plan is and the ends to be served by it:

During the past few days there has been set in motion among the pastors of the city an idea, which will doubtless end in a permanent organization. The plan chiefly originated, so far as its working in Lansing is concerned, with Rev. W. H. Osborne, of the St. Paul's Episcopal Church, and the rest of the clergy are so highly pleased that cooperation is certain.

It has been thought that the Christian church of this city did not fully come into touch with civic affairs, and if anything could be done to make the purifying influence of Christian principles felt a great end would be gained. The church has kept aloof, not as individuals, but as a body, from civic matters. Not that her influence has not been felt, for the spirit of the church exercises the mightiest power, yet she has not openly acted on affairs of a civic nature. The plan now being matured tends toward making one common church of the entire city.

The mode of procedure is somewhat as follows: A council will be formed and be known as the "Federal Council of the Christian Churches of Lansing." Every church will have an equal representation, no matter what difference there may be in regard to the size or membership. The delegates from each church will consist of one clerical and two lay. There are some seventeen churches in the city, and should all be represented in the federate council it would make a body of fifty-one persons. Such a body of representative men from the various churches, laying aside the little differences in religious beliefs, and coming together for deliberation on the relation of the church to passing civic events, cannot but wield a great power.

The primary and probably only object of the council is to apply the principles of Christianity to the entire life of the city; not an interference with affairs, but an application of all that is best to the things of daily routine. It is a plan to apply the principles of Christianity to the corporate life of the city, its industries, its politics, its amusements, its everything.

All the pastors have not been approached on the subject. Time has not permitted this yet, but all who have been seen have gladly and enthusiastically promised their support. It is expected that an organization will be effected in about two weeks.

Councils, similar to the proposed one, have been in operation in some English cities and in a few eastern American places, and the benefits derived have been very apparent. It is true that many things exist in every city, which, if eradicated, would add to the welfare and beauty of the city temporally and spiritually.

It will be noticed that the object in view is to increase the influence of the churches in civil affairs, to mold the different denominations into one body for political purposes. The movement is significant.
