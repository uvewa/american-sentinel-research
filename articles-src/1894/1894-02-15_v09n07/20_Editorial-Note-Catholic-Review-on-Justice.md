THE Catholic Review has the following, in an article on the school question:—

In a question of eternal justice and right what is a majority? In that case one man is as good as a million. He weighs more than the State—more than an universe. The State, backed by an overwhelming majority, has no right to do the slightest injustice or trench one iota upon a single right of the most insignificant individual

"For right is right, since God is God,
And right the day must win;
To doubt would be disloyalty,
To falter would be sin."

First justitia ruat caelum—Let justice be done though the heavens fall, is our motto. We nail it to the mast and with all the weapons we can command—weapons of reason, of logic, of earnest expostulation and persuasive zeal, we will fight under it till we die.

Will the Catholic Review be consistent throughout, and adhere to the principle thus clearly stated when it shall be applied to other questions?
