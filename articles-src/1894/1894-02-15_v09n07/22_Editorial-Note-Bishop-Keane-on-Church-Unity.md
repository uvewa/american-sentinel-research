DECEMBER 21, 1893, the Churchmen's Club, of Providence, R. I., held a meeting at which Rt. Rev. John J. Keane, of the Catholic University, Washington, D. C., was present. The subject under discussion was "Church Unity," and by invitation Bishop Keane participated. Among other things he said:—

I am sincerely glad to be able to speak to you on such a subject. Why, I believe if I went to Pope Leo and asked him if I should come here, he would say, "Why, man alive, what else can you do but go there and speak?"

Why, I know there are a lot of people who think that the Catholics want to remain alone by themselves and to bring down damnation and curses upon everybody else. How could the Catholic Church be Christian if it had such a spirit as that? The spirit of Christianity is love, not hatred, and if we find a spirit of hatred, we know it comes from below. . . . God did not intend that any set of men should live in any one say of light, but should find all colors united in the great Catholic Church. As to the centre of the church, it may be alleged against this or that pope that he was a bad man, but is this reason to destroy the office? No! 'Tis neither logical nor Christian. When the time comes for union these other churches will not find the mother church backward in coming into unity with them. She would rather let us make a bonfire of all that is human and obstructing and, in the church of Christ, find that perfect unity and harmony God intended.

The pith of this all is that Rome is perfectly willing that Protestants should return to the bosom of the "mother church."
