ROME is fast coming to the front in this country, and to accomplish her ends, she is adapting herself to the situation with such consummate skill that few will perceive her designs till everything is forced to surrender to her power. Her present policy is well illustrated by facts that have been developed recently in the State of Iowa, and it will be worth while to look into this little game of blinding a great nation and bringing it to the feet of Rome.

In the Iowa State Register, of December 3, 1893, is published a letter from the local Catholic priest that should open the eyes of Protestants. Appearing as it does in the State Republican paper, issued at Des Moines, and having a large influence throughout the State, it indicates some things in the situation that call for serious attention.

The fact should never be forgotten that "Rome never changes." The fact that she changes her attitude and methods of working is no sign that she has changed her principles or purpose. If she fawns upon Protestantism, it is only because molasses will draw flies better than vinegar. And Protestants should not forget this, or else they will find themselves wholly in the power of Rome ere they know it.

Ex-Priest Slattery and wife were advertised to lecture in Des Moines on Catholicism and its iniquities, the first week in December. They had been mobbed in several western cities shortly before, and Father J. F. Nugent, Roman Catholic priest of Des Moines, evidently thought that another mobbing would only tend to give them still greater notoriety, and hence he wrote a letter advocating another line of action. In this letter he presents some lines of thought that will simply captivate many Protestants—or, rather, those who should be Protestants, for those who will drink in the things said by him, cannot be Protestants in anything but name.

After stating that the city papers had announced the coming of Ex-Priest Slattery and wife, and their purpose, he says:—

It is nothing to us when these parties come or go, neither do we consider it our affair what they talk about, that is, so far as we ourselves are concerned. We would not notice their visit to our city, only we believe the interests of the Catholics demand it.

He then gives this advice to the Catholics:—

I would say to the Catholics of the city and adjoining towns: . . . Hold no arguments or discussions about them, or about anything they may say. These men do the Protestants no good and they can do the Catholic Church no harm.

Evidently this advice was very generally heeded, for the Register, the next morning after Slattery went away, published the following words in an editorial:—

The people of Des Moines, both Protestant, Catholic, and those neither Protestant nor Catholic are to be congratulated in refusing to be stirred up by a religious adventurer.

This editor is a Methodist Episcopal Church member, and he congratulates the people because they would not be stirred up by these startling truths told about the iniquity and abominations of the Catholic Church. Nor was this all; this Methodist Episcopal Church member and editor accepted the letter of the Catholic priest against Slattery and his work, but refused to publish a reply from Slattery. Now we are not saying that all the ex-priest and his company said, was said in the right way, or that they are even working on the right principle; but this we do know, that weak-kneed Protestantism bowed to the papacy when it published the letter of the priest, and then refused to publish the reply of the ex-priest. Fairness would at least demand that if one had a hearing the other should. And then to add shame to the whole thing, Protestants are congratulated because they refuse "to be stirred up" by a knowledge of Rome's determined purpose to rule this country. Is there danger from Rome? Let Rome answer. But heaven save the poor, blind Protestants who tell her to her face that she does not mean what she says when she declares that this country belongs to her, and that it is her purpose to possess herself of that which rightfully belongs to her. Rome's demands are loud and plain, yet Protestants sleep on, thinking themselves secure. Or is the trouble along another line; has Rome already so far gotten things in her own hand, that Protestants dare not say No to any of her demands, or reply to any of her insults?

This letter states that ex-priests who go from place to place warning the people of the terrible iniquity of Rome, have been furthered on and have obtained success through the abuse and violence offered them by Catholics themselves. He says, "Some priests who ought to be generals showed no more tactics than the rabble. . . . We feel confident that these mistakes will not be repeated." That is, "When these warning voices will not keep silence through threats and violence, we will treat them so kindly that they really cannot say anything against us or our work." But all this is for an object. Rome's millions have been assembling in this country for years, with just one object in view, the complete subjugation of the nation. To-day they claim the land as theirs by right of discovery, and openly assert that all the real advancement of the last century has been directly through their labors and wisdom. And professed Protestants dare not open their mouth or wield their pen to show the truth and oppose this work of evil deception, but will rather congratulate themselves and the Catholic Church for the wonderful things the papal power is doing right before their eyes. Nor do they stop with that, for they blindly assist in forging the fetters that bind the conscience and take the last vestige of honor out of the people of these United States of America.

But, for an example, this Des Moines priest says: "We want the Catholics of this city to show the Catholics of this country how to receive Mr. and Mrs. Slattery when the occasion presents itself." What does this mean? What are these two persons doing that concerns the priests and their followers? Why, they have had their eyes opened to the terrible iniquity in the papal system, and they are telling the citizens of the country what Rome designs to do just as soon as she has the power. Power is all she wants, then good bye liberty, good bye freedom of press and pulpit, good bye to all that is dear to the human heart, and good bye to all progress. If you do not believe it, look at Mexico, look at Spain, look at nearly all South American countries, at Italy, and every other land that has been blessed(!) by the rule of the papacy for a few centuries. What do you see? Ignorance and superstition, poverty and want of every sort, and the people bound with chains of darkness the most galling, and no ray of hope before them.

But we must notice other points in this new policy of Rome. The conditions here are different from what they are in the countries we have named, and so they adapt themselves to the conditions of the country they wish to bring to worship at the feet of Rome. For this reason they can champion liberty of speech and press, but it is for a purpose of their own. So this Des Moines priest says:—

I would regard the violent interruption of a public speaker as a greater wrong to the public than anything the most foul mouthed and inflammatory speaker could say if allowed to speak. It must never be forgotten that free speech is the greatest gift of a free people. Any one who has read the history of other days when man was led to prison and the block for the crime of expressing his opinions, will readily understand the necessity of defending liberty of speech, if necessary, at the point of the bayonet.

That sounds well. But is that true Catholic doctrine? It is just now. It is the new policy of "the church." And why? Rome aims to conquer this country; indeed, she has it in her hands to-day, but in order to silence those who oppose her, to silence those who see through her scheme, she says for the time being, just the thing that they say. Protestantism is built on the fullest possible liberty of the individual rights of man. This liberty will never allow its possessor to trample under foot the rights of the weakest subject, because that subject is in its power; but instead, true Protestantism will defend to the limit of its rightful power the freedom of the weakest—the one who cannot defend himself—in the enjoyment of his God-given liberty.

Rome hates free speech, freedom of conscience, freedom of action,—except for herself. She must stand supreme over all. She must have absolute freedom. She claims it as her right to set aside the decrees of rulers, to trample under foot the freedom of others, especially those who stand in her way to the highest place of earthly power and honor. Neither does she deign to stop there, but assumes to set aside at pleasure any word or command of God, and makes herself the very God of the universe. Does she truly regard the rights of man? Does she honestly esteem others as herself? She only turns professedly from her path and speaks softly that by peace she may destroy many—quench their protesting, stop their opposition, bring them to agree with her, to say that, after all, the true place for the Catholic Church is at the very head, the highest place, and that all others are wrong and should be destroyed. Then, and only then, does her policy change.

The time was when men and women were led to prison and to the block for expressing an opinion. And not only that, but even for having an opinion. If one had an opinion of his own, though never expressed, he would be sought out and dragged to the stake or rack, and by torture compelled, if possible, to recant his opinion. But the grace of God held millions from recanting and that grace is free for all now. Protestants, arouse, awake, and protest against the sophistry of Rome; stand by the grace of God for freedom and right! Worship not at the shrine of iniquity, the mystery of iniquity, but know your individual civil and religious rights!
