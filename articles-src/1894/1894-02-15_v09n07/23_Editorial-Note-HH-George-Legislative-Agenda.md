In a recent communication to the so-called Christian Reformer, H. H. George, the manager of the National Reform lobby in Washington, thus outlines the work which his association proposes to push through during the present Congress, if possible:—

I have scheduled some seven or eight matters of the highest importance to be presented as soon as the way can be opened. They are like these: (1.) A Sabbath law for the District of Columbia. (2.) A few against the Honduras Lottery. This may have to be a treaty. (3.) A national Sabbath law. (4.) The appointment of divorce commissioners in the District of Columbia. (5.) To urge a treaty with China that may nullify the existing exclusion law. (6.) The sixteenth amendment, on the school question. (7.) A protest against the admission of Utah, and especially against combining with it Arizona and New Mexico. It is believed that these are all but beds of Mormonism. And (8), most important of all, Our Christian Amendment.

One item which Mr. George must have forgotten is the discontinuance of Sunday mails. That is one of the pet schemes of these pseudo-reformers. The people won't like it, but they will probably have to submit to it when the time comes.
