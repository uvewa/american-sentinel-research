An incident occurred in Santiago, Chili, which illustrates better than arguments what the real nature of Romanism is. It was in connection with the extraordinary low rate of exchange. A Chili peso or dollar is worth but sixteen English pennies. The rate has remained low for some time. The result has been that prices have risen enormously.

The archbishop of Santiago has inserted an advertisement in the papers stating that because of this bad state of public finance, it will be needful to raise the whole scale of church rates. Prices for masses and for funerals and for baptisms and for the whole list of stock in trade will be advanced fifty per cent. Indulgences cost double now. "Bulas," or "Bulls," granting permission to eat meat, cost double. Masses have gone up. It costs more now to get through tickets to heaven than before. Indeed the through tickets have not been issued; only half way stop-overs can be obtained. Like immigrants in America who send for their friends and bring them over with the first money earned in the new land, so reversing the process those who go on before with halfway stop-over tickets patiently wait for the investments of their friends on this side, which will secure from the church orders to have the spiritual freight duly forwarded. All this, however, costs double now, because of the depression in the money market. The appearance of this unique advertisement caused a good deal of comment, and the liberal press took occasion to say several hard things about such traffic in spiritual things.—Rev. J. M. Allis, in Church at Home and Abroad.
