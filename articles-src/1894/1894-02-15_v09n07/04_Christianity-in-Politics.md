The Voice of the 1st inst. had this from Chicago, Ill., under date of January 27:—

The Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor for Illinois proposes to go into the forthcoming elections in Illinois in a campaign for "Christian citizenship." Here is the programme of the principles which the society will take into the campaign and apply in supporting the various candidates:

"To exterminate the saloon as the greatest enemy of Christ and the Church.

"To prevent, by personal effort, the election of corrupt candidates and the enactment of corrupt laws in city, State, and nation.

"To secure fidelity on the part of officers intrusted with the execution of the laws.

"To preserve the American Sabbath.

"To purify and elevate the elective franchise.

"To promote the study of social wrongs and remedies.

"In general to seek the reign of whatsoever things are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, and of good report."

Here is "confusion worse confounded." Civil and religious things are jumbled together in one confused mass, to be urged upon the State for purely religious reasons; and to speak against the movement is to be branded as an infidel, an opposer of good government, the consort of saloon-keepers, etc., etc.
