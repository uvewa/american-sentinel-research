The pope is taking advantage of the world-wide business depression to make capital for himself. January 28, he delivered an address in Rome, in which he said:—

We cannot on this occasion omit to recall the past, when the presence of the popes gave Rome, not merely for years, but for centuries, glorious tranquil prosperity. That prosperity was the outcome of neither chance nor the institutions of man. It was rational and sure of the morrow. Life was then calm and well ordered. Nothing was wanting for the well-being of the people. The opposite is true of the present. If we would profit by bitter experience, let us trace the evils to their origin and seek an effectual remedy. The religious ruin, invoked and designed, has brought moral and material ruin. Not only justice, but also political expediency, must demand the return of the nation to the religion of its fathers, with mutual confidence and affection, and without suspicion of the pope, whose preaching of the life eternal renders even mortal life happy and prosperous.

What the pope wants is temporal power. He is just as free now to preach the life eternal in Rome as he would be to preach it in New York City, but he is not free to keep others from preaching also.
