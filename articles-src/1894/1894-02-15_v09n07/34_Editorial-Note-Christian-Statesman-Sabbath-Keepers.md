THE Christian Statesman has always professed to favor exemption of Sabbath-keepers from the provisions of Sunday laws so far as private work was concerned, but now the mask is thrown off. In its issue of the 3rd inst., the Statesman quotes the Maryland Court of Appeals as follows: "The tendency of legislation in this country is to provide for further rest rather than to take away the day of rest that is welcomed by the industrial and hard-working people of our land;" and then adds this comment: "Let all true reformers encourage this tendency by assisting in a strict enforcement of our present statutes." This shows that the Statesman's past professions have been mere hypocrisy; but Sabbath-keepers have not asked exemption and do not expect even justice. They do, however, confidently expect final deliverance by the appearing of the Lord of the Sabbath.
