THE National Reformers are pushing their "Christian" amendment vigorously. The House Judiciary Committee has granted a hearing on the Morse resolution, to begin March 13 and continue as long as the committee desires to hear on the subject. The Senate committee has done nothing as yet, and immediate action is not probable.
