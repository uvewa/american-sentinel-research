In response to a request from the Independent thirty-one bishops of the Roman Catholic Church in this country have stated, with more or less clearness, their attitude towards our public school system. The Romish hierarchy know very well what the policy of their church is respecting this subject, and they also know how to illustrate and defend that policy. The question which was addressed to them is plain and direct; their answers are, for the most part, involved and evasive. Every intelligent American knows that the Romish hierarchy in this country would be glad to secure "a division of the public school fund" for their own sectarian uses. They have heard recently from the American people, however, and they are wise enough to see that it would be bad "policy" to agitate this question "for the present." Some of the bishops have frankly said so. They say with the arch-bishop of New Orleans: "Our principles are all right, but prudence and the reasonable fear of grave consequences suggest the advisability of not insisting that these principles be carried out in the manner proposed." Bishop McQuaid does not so much object to the "manner proposed" as he does to the untimeliness of the proposition. He says: "An agitation with a view to a division of the State school fund would, at the present time, be injudicious and inopportune." Bishop Ludden is less adroit, but quite as honest, when he says that he wants a "share" of the public school fund for his parish schools. He wants it, he says, "by all means, and by every principle of right, liberty, and justice."

In view of these statements (and others of the hierarchy addressed give expression to similar sentiments), we cannot understand why our contemporary should say: "It is plain that if they had the power to blot the public school system entirely out of existence and leave education to voluntary effort, they would not do so." This may be true, so far as Roman Catholic laymen are concerned, but it is manifest, from their published letters, that the prelates and priests of the Romish Church would, if they could, blot out of existence our system of public education. Bishop Heslin voices the doctrine of his church on the subject, when he says: "The present public school system is virtually a persecution of Catholics." Bishop Hennessy proclaims the same doctrine, when he says: "The religious conscience of our people is regarded and respected in every matter of public concern with the single exception of education."

These are bold words. Their meaning is clear. Our system of national education is, they say, "a persecution of Catholics." It neither regards nor respects their "religious conscience." And yet we are told that these prelates would not overthrow a system of education that persecutes them and their people, and that pays no regard to their religious conscience! They would not overthrow our system of education, says our contemporary, they would only "modify" it. What a modification that would be! After passing through the modifying hands of the Romish hierarchy we might search in vain for the original system. The change would be radical. Our public schools, instead of being strictly undenominational, as they now are, would then be strictly sectarian. The school fund which now goes to give all the youth of the land a common school education, would be divided among the sects for sectarian purposes. This is what a "modification" of our public school system would mean, if molded after the pattern of the Romish hierarchy. And this is, precisely, what the American people must never permit. In vain is the net spread in sight of the American eagle.

We have some idea of what our country would be in respect of education, as well as in respect of temporal and spiritual things, if the seat of government were changed from Washington to Rome. History throws a flood of light upon that subject. No true patriot would wish to see our system of education exchanged for that which prevailed in Italy, for example, in those times when the pope had it all his own way. The public school system was "modified" to suit him. There was no "persecution of Catholics" after the wicked American fashion. Their "religious conscience" was "regarded and respected." The youth in the common schools were not contaminated by such a system of education as obtains in this intolerant country. They were nurtured by "mother church." The result was—as the whole world knows—national ignorance and well nigh national decay. The same is true of Spain and of other countries when the Romish hierarchy had control of the system of education. If we want to secure similar results all we have to do is to allow the Romish hierarchy to "modify" our public school system.

But there is no danger, provided Protestants do not lapse into indifference. Priests and prelates and cardinals may continue to call our schools "godless," and our system of education "muchristian." They will try again and again to get their hands into the public treasury in order to use it for their own sectarian purposes; but their efforts must be in vain. This nation can never allow its public schools to fall into sectarian hands. We will keep our public schools, as they now are, free to all classes, and where all stand on an equal footing before the law. There must not be any division of public school funds among the various religious denominations in this land, either "for the present" or for the future. Americans believe in religious toleration, for with a great sum we obtained this freedom. And, as there is no room in this Republic for religious intolerance, so there should never be any room in it for the propagation of sectarianism in connection with our system of public schools.—N. Y.
