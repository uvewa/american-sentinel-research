At the entrance to the Catholic village of Oberwyl, near Basel, attached to a crucifix, is the declaration that whoever prays five Ave Marias and Paternosters before this image will be granted forty days' indulgence. The fact that Catholics grant indulgences has ceased to be surprising, but who would believe that Protestants would do the same thing? One of the chief causes that led to the Reformation was the sale of indulgences. This is really what started Luther on his crusade against Rome. This is what led people to protest and thus become Protestants more than anything else.

But prophecy declares that Protestants would yet render homage and honor to Rome. We see this fulfilling to-day. There is a general tendency Romeward among Protestants. They took the first step in this direction when they united the church with the civil powers, and every religious law made by the State is an additional step in the same direction. By making Sunday laws, Protestants render special homage to Rome, for they are thus elevating and enforcing an institution for which there is no Bible authority, but which rests solely on the authority of the Catholic Church. And even more, Sunday is the usurper of the place of the Lord's Sabbath, and thus, in sustaining it, Protestants virtually reject God's institution and accept, in its stead, that of the papacy.

But what about Protestant indulgences? They come in along with the Sunday laws. When we once accept the principles of Rome, we are inevitably led to the same acts, and sooner or later we shall see growing up among Protestants the same things that made Rome so obnoxious. And it falls to the lot of the far-famed pious Protestant city of Basel to furnish us an illustration of the truthfulness of this statement.

This city has a Sunday law, forbidding work on this day, and punishes with fines or imprisonments the naughty people that do not obey it. But for the last three Sundays of 1893, this law was suspended, and everybody could work to his heart's content, without fear of being disturbed by modern inquisitors. Thus, the whole city was granted a three-weeks' indulgence. We now ask, How much better is this than papal indulgences? The principle is the same. First, it is declared to be wrong to work on Sunday, and at another time it is permitted as all right. The true nature of this transaction is more apparent when we consider that Sunday is a religious institution, taking the place of the Sabbath. Remove the religious element, and there would be no demand for Sunday laws. The religious part is the soul and life of the institution. We are zealously taught that it is wrong to work on this day. This being the case, when the State gives everybody permission to work on it, the State virtually grants an indulgence to do wrong; and is thus doing precisely the same work as the papacy did in granting indulgences in the days of Tetzel.

By taking such a course, the State, or false Protestantism through the State, like the papacy, elevates itself above God. God being righteous, cannot pronounce the transgression of his law sin at one time and not sin at another. It may be argued that God also permits work on the Sabbath. True, but on an entirely different basis. He permits works of mercy, but such works are lawful on every Sabbath. But by punishing people for Sunday work at one time, and at another granting everybody permission to work on Sunday, the State virtually pretends to do what God cannot do. This is a faithful image to the papacy. It not only puts man in the place of God, but elevates him above God. This is why God warns us so solemnly against it. Read Rev. 14:9, 10.
