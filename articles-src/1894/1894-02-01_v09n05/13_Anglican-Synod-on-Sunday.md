THE ANGLICAN Synod, recently in session in Montreal, adopted resolutions denouncing Sunday street cars, the opening of parks on Sunday, and pauper immigration. The discussion of Sunday cars by the synod brought to light the fact that many of the clergymen were in the habit of patronizing the street railways on that day. One member of the synod defended the cars on the ground of convenience and said that cabs and other carriages made more confusion on Sunday than did the cars. The resolution was, however, finally adopted unanimously.
