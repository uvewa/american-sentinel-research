The fight for Sunday cars is still on in Toronto, but not on any correct principle. The following from the Toronto World of January 15, gives the situation:—

Citizens Kelly and Hendry continue to give a good long service in Queen Street West. Yesterday seven leases were on this route and as usual did a good business. Citizen Kelly says the street is crowded with people at all hours of the day and it is no trouble at all to pick up a bus load of people. It takes twenty-one men and twenty-eight horses to give the service. The same number of men working electric cars, and no horses, would afford accommodation for ten times as many people. The leases are now a fixture, and men and horses will continue to be used until the cars are put on. Next summer the principal argument in favor of Sunday cars will be that they will reduce the number of men employed on Sunday and do away with a large amount of horse labor on Sunday. Next summer will see three times as many men working on Sunday as there will be any occasion for, and hundreds of horses will be impressed into seven days' work that ought to be resting on Sunday. Sunday cars will be introduced as much to reduce Sunday labor as because the people want them.

This is a virtual abandonment of the only correct principle on which the fight could have been made, namely, on the inalienable right of people to work and travel on any day, without let or hindrance. The plea now made is a practical acknowledgment of the paternal theory of government. Toronto may get Sunday cars but its people will not get liberty.
