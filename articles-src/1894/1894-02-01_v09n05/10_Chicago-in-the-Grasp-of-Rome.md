CHICAGO, Ill., Jan. 22.—A Washington special to the Inter-Ocean says a delegation of American and German Democrats from Chicago recently had a secret interview with Cleveland, having gone to Washington in cog., to protest against the appointment of Martin Russell as collector, and of Frank Lawler as marshal, on the ground that this would put the entire city in Roman Catholic control, and that the effects were already injurious to the party.

The dispatch states that a paper was filed with the President showing that the local Roman Catholics already fill the following offices: mayor, chief of police, chief of the fire department, postmaster, State's attorney, clerk of Circuit Court, clerk of Probate Court, clerk of Superior Court, a number of judges, forty-five out of sixty-eight aldermen, 90 per cent. of the police force, 80 per cent. of the members of the fire department, and 67 per cent. of the school teachers.
