[The following dispatches clipped from a single number of a New York daily, are republished by us simply as significant signs of the times.]

OMAHA, Jan. 18.—Roundsman Charles Bloom, one of the best-known and most efficient officers in the city and the recognized head of the anti-Catholic circle in his district, handed in his resignation to-day being charged with writing a letter to Mayor Bemis in which the lives of the mayor, the chief of police and Republican National Committeeman Rosewater were threatened. The letter was signed, "Guiteau-Prendergast," and the writer declared that he would kill the mayor if certain things were not done.

The matter was kept quiet for a day or two, and then it was referred to the chief of police. The result was that to-day the chief preferred charges against Officer Bloom. He was taken before a meeting of the commissioners and required to write the letter as it was dictated to him by a member of the board. Not only was the handwriting found to be identical, but the same words were misspelled in both letters.

Bloom's trial was set for to-morrow.

Some time ago the chief of police ordered all of the force to desist from mixing in politics. This was deemed to be necessary in view of the activity of the American Protective Association members on one side and the Catholics on the other.

Bloom is said to be a member of the American Protective Association.

MILWAUKEE, Wis., Jan. 18.—W. A. Sims, the American Protective Association lecturer, was stoned by a mob at Kaukauna, Wis., last night. The mob got beyond the control of the police, and Governor Peck was called on for troops. During the lecture stones were thrown through the windows and several persons were hurt. At the close Sims demanded the protection of the police. The crowd at the stairs learned where he was going and followed, arriving at the bridge by a different route almost at the same time that Sims did.

Another demonstration was made, but the officers held the bridge against the mob, and all they could do was to throw stones and other missiles at the lecturer as he ran across the bridge. Governor Peck was not at Madison and did not get the message until this morning. After hiding with friends last night, Sims, escorted by by a bodyguard of his American Protective Association friends, armed with rifles, was escorted to the depot this morning and took a train for Ashland.

KANSAS CITY, Mo., Jan. 18.—A subpoena has been issued for J. V. McNamara, the ex-Catholic priest, to whose lecture last Tuesday night the riot at Turner Hall was largely due. The complainant is J. F. Mullin, whose arrest McNamara caused in the hall the night of the lecture because he was said to have called the ex-priest a liar. It is believed that McNamara has left the city.

EMPORIA, Kan., Jan. 18.—The American Protective Association excitement has reached this city. Judge J. F. Culver, who admits he is president of a lodge that numbers nearly eight hundred members in this city, says he has received a letter threatening him and Wm. J. Murray with death. It was decorated with a skull and cross-bones. Lodges are being formed in all the surrounding cities, it is said. Yesterday a man named Bradley went to Burlington and attempted to organize a lodge, but was chased out of town.
