AN exchange remarks that the clergy of St. Louis are on record as favoring the taxation of Church property; but says that "one minister opposed the reform. He took the ground that as Protestants had more property in Missouri than the Catholics, it would be unwise to tax the churches as Protestants would be the losers." Pretty Protestantism that! Right is right no matter whom it hurts. If Church property ought to be taxed—and it certainly should—it ought to be taxed no matter to whom it belongs. An infidel paper, the Boston Investigator, makes this comment on the position of the "Protestant" minister who makes the plea for exemption:—

We fear that this is about the size of the morality of Protestants. They oppose a measure that gives somebody else a greater advantage than they themselves enjoy from it. This seems to be the way that a great deal of justice gets into the world. When one party is jealous of another, then the right triumphs.

The Investigator mistakes in supposing that such men are Protestants. It is such morality, masquerading under the name of Protestantism and Christianity, that makes infidels. If all who profess the Christian name and who call themselves Protestants were such indeed, the Investigator would be without occupation, or would soon be preaching the faith it now seeks to destroy.
