MUNICIPAL COURT JUDGE REID rendered a decision in the Krech case yesterday. The decision sustains the legality of the law requiring the closing of all places of business on Sunday and overrules the defendant's demurrer to the complaint. Henry Krech, the Fife hotel barber, will therefore have to stand his trial upon the charge of shaving customers on Sundays.

Judge Reid's decision first recites alleged facts in relation to the case and then quotes the Sunday law. It then takes up the defendant's objection that the law is unconstitutional in that it is discriminating in allowing hotels, livery stables and restaurants, to keep open while forbidding other business establishments to do so, and is thereby class legislation. The decision holds that while the constitutional provision forbids legislation in favor of any particular class of citizens, it does not follow that the act in question affects any particular class, it being directed against certain kinds of business and not in any wise prohibiting all citizens from engaging in the exempted lines if they so desire. The first ground of objection to the validity of the act is therefore decided to be untenable.

The defendant's second objection asserts that the Sunday law is designed to compel observance of the Christian religion, and therefore illegal; that to be compelled to close his place of business amounts to a molestation and disturbance of both his person and property, and that the religious liberty of the Hebrew would be thus violated by such compulsory observance. The court holds that if he were correct in his claim the law could not stand against his objection, but that he is in error in that the law does not intend to aid or repress any religious sect, but simply to provide a day of rest and to preserve the public health. In support of this the court quotes cases precedent, and disallows the defendant's contention.

In regard to the claim of the defendant that shaving is not a trade, but a necessity, the court decides that such a question could best be settled by a jury trial. He therefore overrules the demurrer and gives leave to plead.—Sunday Ledger, Tacoma, Wash., Jan. 14.
