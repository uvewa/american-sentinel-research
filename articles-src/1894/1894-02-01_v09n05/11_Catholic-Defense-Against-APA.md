"REPRESENTATIVES of twenty-six parishes in Milwaukee," says the Catholic Review, "have founded an organization to defend their possession of their civic rights against the attacks of the American Protective Association." The Review significantly adds:

Our Wisconsin co-religionists show that they value their rights of conscience and of Constitution by promptly combining to prevent those rights from being infringed, abridged or destroyed. They are acting in self-defense, forced to do so by the aggressions of the Know Nothing conspiracy; but in trying to defend themselves they may have to give blows as well as to ward them off. To our intense regret, the American Protective Association has coerced us into this attitude. On that treasonable secret society lies the blame for all the trouble that will ensue.

The signs of the times are ominous. The Christian will watch with interest the gathering clouds, and will warn as many as possible of the coming storm; but he will, at the same time, remember that "the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds." "All they that take the sword shall perish with the sword."
