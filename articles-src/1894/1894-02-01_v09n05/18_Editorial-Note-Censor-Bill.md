THE bill creating in this country a censor of the press, which was before the last Congress, has been re-introduced in the present Congress by Mr. Hayes of Iowa. The bill empowers the postmaster general to exclude from the mails any publication which in his opinion devotes too much attention to reports of crime or to "stories of immoral deeds."
