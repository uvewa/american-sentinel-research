ACCORDING to the Philadelphia Inquirer of the 20th inst., a movement is on foot in that city to enforce the Sunday law of 1794. A petition to this effect was recently handed to the mayor. It was said to emanate from the Law and Order Society and was to have been presented by Lewis D. Vail, its attorney; but for some reason he did not do so. A clerk in his office said the movement was inspired by Rev. Dr. Fernley, secretary of the Philadelphia Sabbath Association, so-called, and that Mr. Vail declined association with it because he believed it futile. The mayor declines to express an opinion. Cigar and candy stores are, it seems, the principal offenders at present.
