### SATAN'S STRONGEST AGENCY.

Now it has been the purpose of Satan all these centuries to put something else in the place of Christ, himself if possible,—at all events, to turn away the minds of men from the worship of God as manifested in Jesus Christ. By reading two prophecies, and putting them together, we shall see the force of this working of Satan, through an agency through which his work has been carried on more successfully and for a longer time than through any other agency in the history of the world.

"How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High." Isa. 14:12-14. This scripture evidently speaks of the fall of Satan and the reason for it; for Lucifer, "the light bearer," by his own course of rebellion became Satan, "the adversary." "Let no man deceive you by any means; for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposed and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God." 2 Thess. 2:3,4. Every one knows that this prophecy refers to the papacy, and every one who puts those two scriptures together can see that they represent exactly the same spirit,—I will exalt myself above God.

In the papacy we have, in organized form, the greatest manifestation of the working of Satan that this world has ever seen; and the whole principle of the papacy is self-exaltation, the very principle that characterized Satan at the beginning, the very principle which led to his downfall. And this organized power steps forth and claims just what this prophecy says that it should claim,—that it stands in the place of God. The pope, the head of this church, is called the vicar of Christ, or the vicegerent of Christ, that is, he is the one who rules in the place of Christ. Or, in other words, he has put himself in the place of Christ. He poses as the substitute of Christ. That is simply the same old scheme of the devil. He wanted Christ's place, he wanted the honor and worship that belong to Christ; and this organized manifestation of the spirit and the working of Satan is the same thing over again. It is putting some one else in the place of Christ. And not only that, but the papacy claims to control the saving power of God, that is, his creative power.

### THE PAPACY CLAIMS SAVING POWER.

The fact that the papacy claims to exercise the saving power of God, is evident from the following extract from De Harbe's "Full Catechism of the Catholic Religion," approved by Catholic authorities, and published in New York by the Catholic Publishing Association, in 1883. The extract is from page 145: "Every one is obliged, under pain of eternal damnation, to become a member of the Catholic Church, to believe her doctrine, to use her means of grace, and to submit to her authority. Hence the Catholic Church is justly called the only saving church. To despise her is the same as to despise Christ, namely, his doctrine, his means of grace, and his powers. To separate from her is the same as to separate from Christ, and to forfeit eternal salvation. Therefore St. Augustine and the other bishops of Africa pronounced, A. D. 412, at the council of Zirta, this decision: "Whosoever is separated from the Catholic Church, however commendable, in his opinion, his life may be, he shall, for this very reason, that he has at some time separated from the unity of Christ, not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him."

The Catholic Church, the papacy,—that organization through which this spirit of Satan has been manifested, in opposing itself against God, in exalting itself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped,—that church claims to have the authority to control the saving grace and power of God. But what is the saving power of God?—It is creative power. We have learned that. What is the sign of God's creative power, that he is the true God, and that our worship belongs to him because he is the Creator?—It is the true Sabbath.

But here comes another power, the papacy, claiming that it controls saving grace, and that there can be no salvation outside of the authority of the Catholic Church. And one of the charges made against Luther was that he had invented a new means of justification, so that the sinner could come to God and receive pardon without the intervention of church or priest. We have found that God, who is the Creator, and who in Jesus Christ dispenses his saving power freely to all who believe, has established the Sabbath as the sign of that power. Since the Catholic Church, the agency of Satan, claims to have saving power, and to dispense that power, the very logic of the situation demands that she should have a rival sign as a sign of her pretended power, and so she has it in the rival Sabbath. And as she claims that "to separate from her is the same as to separate from Christ and to forfeit eternal salvation," thus putting herself in the place of Christ, so she demands that the sign of her power should be accepted instead of the true Sabbath, and says: "The keeping holy the Sunday is a thing absolutely necessary to salvation."—A Sure Way to Find out the True Religion," by Rev. T. Baddeloy, p. 95; published by P. J. Kennedy, Catholic Publisher, etc., New York.

## WHO CAN SAVE?

Consider now that we have before us two days; one is the sign of the power of God in creation and salvation; the other has been instituted by Christ's rival, and has been taken up as a Sabbath, or a pretended Sabbath, by that power (the papacy) through which Satan has wrought for a longer time, and in a more marked manner, than in any other power in the earth's history. One is a sign, or a mark, of the power of God; the other is a sign, or a mark, of the rival power. The question then comes, In whom shall we trust for salvation—in the power of God in Christ, or in a rival power? In whom shall we place our confidence for forgiveness of sins—in God, the Creator of the heaven and the earth, or in that rival power that would exalt itself against God? Who can save—the one of whose power for the creation anew in Christ Jesus the true Sabbath is the sign, or mark, or the one of whose pretended power the false Sabbath is the sign or mark?

The Lord says: "Moreover also I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them. . . . And hallow my Sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God." Eze. 20:12, 20. But the Catholic Church says: "It is worth while to remember that this observance of the Sabbath, in which, after all, the only Protestant worship consists, not only has no foundation in the Bible, but it is a flagrant contradiction of its letter, which commands rest on the Sabbath, which is Saturday. It was the Catholic Church which, by the authority of Jesus Christ, has transferred this to the Sunday, in remembrance of the resurrection of our Lord. Thus the observance of Sunday by the Protestants is an homage they pay, in spite of themselves, to the authority of the Catholic Church."—"Plain Talk About the Protestantism of To-day," p. 213.

What does this mean?—It means this; and the whole question is now clearly before us. The true Sabbath is the sign of the power of God in Jesus Christ, however, wherever, whenever manifested. In the creation of the heaven and the earth, in the deliverance of the children of Israel from Egypt, in the re-creation of the individual,—that is, in conversion, which is but the deliverance of the individual from spiritual bondage,—the Sabbath is the sign of the true God, and of his power manifested through Jesus Christ. The Sunday is but a pretended Sabbath, a rival Sabbath, the sign of the rival power.
