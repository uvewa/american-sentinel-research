THE Christian Statesman complains that "the Phipps Conservatory in Schenley Park, Pittsburg, was thrown open to the public, Sabbath, January 7, and four thousand visitors are reported." The Statesman adds, "This in Sabbath-loving Pittsburg, while in Sabbathless France the Sabbath sentiment is increasing." This is truly awful! What is the country coming to when people even in Pittsburg will persist in visiting a conservatory on Sunday? Mind you, a conservatory! a wicked place in which flowers actually grow and exhibit their gorgeous tints and exhale their sweet perfumes on Sunday! How long, American Sabbath Union, oh, how long? Cannot the papacy or somebody put a stop to such things ere the "American Sabbath" be—smothered in a bank of winter roses—murdered in an evil resort wherein flowers are permitted to run opposition to the Sunday pulpit?
