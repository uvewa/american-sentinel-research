AMONG other items under the general heading, "Sabbath Reform," the Christian Statesman publishes this from Kansas City, Mo.:

On a recent Sabbath [Sunday the Statesman means] the bar of the Centropolis Hotel bore this inscription, "Bar closed. Bartender gone to church. Go thou and do likewise."

This reminds us of a statement published some years ago in the California Prohibitionist, namely, "If the saloons will close on Sunday it is about all we can ask." The Statesman is professedly "devoted to the whole circle of reforms," but everything else is made secondary to a puritanical Sunday. The Statesman evidently agrees with the California paper that Sunday closing is about all that can be asked of the saloons.
