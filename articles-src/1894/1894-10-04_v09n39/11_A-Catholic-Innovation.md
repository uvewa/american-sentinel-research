CONSIDERABLE attention is being attracted to a Roman Catholic Church in Minneapolis on account of innovations that have been introduced into its religious life. It is so seldom that the Catholic Church adopts anything that savors of Protestantism, that the press at large makes mention of this particular case. In the first place, a Bible class was organized about a year ago for the study of the Catholic Bible. It would be unheard of to study the Protestant Bible; but it was the Bible nevertheless. This class was thrown open to the general public, and during the last season there was an average attendance of sixty. But, mirabile dicta! this same church, and, by the way, it is one of the largest and most influential in the Northwest, has now introduced congregational singing. This is something entirely new in America, although it has been in vogue in England and Germany. But this is not to be chanting or anything in that nature. A regular hymn book is being prepared, and they are to enjoy genuine congregational singing. They will use many of the favorite Protestant hymns, too, and with the same old tunes that have made them so familiar to that church. These innovations will undoubtedly be welcomed, not only in the Protestant, but even in the Catholic Church, as showing a marked progress towards the spirit of the times.—New York Sunday World, Sept. 23.
