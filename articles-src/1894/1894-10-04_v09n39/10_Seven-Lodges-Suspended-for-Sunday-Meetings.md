READING, Sept. 24.—A special meeting of the Grand Trustees of the Grand Lodge of Elks of the United States was held here this afternoon to consider the disagreements and discussions in the order. When the order was founded it consisted chiefly of theatrical men and those who found it convenient to meet on Sunday. Finally the Sunday meetings were severely criticised, but there were a number of lodges which refused to change the day of meeting.

To-night Grand Exalted Ruler Friday issued a proclamation suspending the following lodges, which are the only ones to disobey the circular of June 1894, commanding the discontinuance of Sunday meetings: New York, No. 1; Philadelphia, No. 2; Baltimore, No. 7; Boston, No. 10; Washington, No. 15; Denver, Colo., No. 17, and Norfolk, Va., No. 38.

The suspended lodges are forbidden to hold any further meetings or to transact business as Elks lodges, and all lodges are directed to deny admission or recognition to any of the suspended lodges or their members. If seven or more law-abiding Elks of suspended lodges desire to reorganize their lodges, a dispensation will be granted on application.—Sun, Sept. 25.
