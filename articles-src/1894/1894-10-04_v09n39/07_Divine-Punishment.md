"I like your paper very much. I would like to ask you if the Scripture does not warrant us in the belief that the present fearful drought and failure of crops is not due to the desecration of the Sabbath? For all through this country there will more gather to watch baseball players on the Sabbath than attend church."

In reply: Sometimes we can see the connection between the sin and God's punishment of it. When we see the apple hanging on the tree we can say that it has grown on the tree. But sometimes we cannot see the connection between a particular sin and a special display of God's anger against sin; and then we cannot assert that the visitation is the result of the one sin alone.

Sabbath desecration leads to political corruption, through the daily papers which are the teachers and leaders of the people. We first teach the reporters and editors that God commands rest; and then as a body politic we afford them protection and aid in publishing, distributing and selling Sunday papers. Thus we teach the teachers of the people that money is more important than the Decalogue. Our political and social debasement is the direct punishment of Sabbath desecration, and this political corruption brings in hosts of other sins. For one or more of these God sends the drought.

We ought to do one of two things: either repudiate the fourth commandment or stop the Sunday mails and baseball.

Perhaps if the preachers put more Christian patriotism into their sermons their congregations would be larger.

"Ye shall keep my Sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary; I am the Lord. If ye walk in my statutes and keep my commandments and do them; then will I give you rain in due season." This text from Leviticus, 20th chapter, seems to especially connect Sabbath-keeping and reverencing God's sanctuaries with seasonable showers. —Christian Patriot, (Morristown, Tenn.,) Sept. 15.
