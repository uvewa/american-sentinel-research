HAVERHILL, Mass., Sept. 25.—The Patriotic Catholic American is the name of a new organization which, its founders believe will counteract the influence of the A. P. A. in this section of the country. The organization has just been formed, and it is claimed that there are twelve branches already.—New York Sun, Sept. 26, 1894.
