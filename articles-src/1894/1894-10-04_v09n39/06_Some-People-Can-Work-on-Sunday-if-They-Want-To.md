THREE carpenters, O. F. Noble, of 20 Holyoke Street, Frank Schoonard, of 67 Minton Street, and H. A. Cook, of 57 Walton Avenue, repaired a little photograph gallery on wheels, Sunday, and were arrested for violating the Sunday labor law. But the policeman who made the arrest did not know that the men were Seventh-day Adventists. He was astonished when they "gave him the laugh," and he called it impudence. On Monday morning Prosecutor Fiedler got down his law book and began to look for information. He found that persons who conscientiously held the seventh day as a day of worship could not be prosecuted for working on the first day. Then the cases were willed. The policeman turned a sickly smile on the prosecutor and went down the stairs whistling "Every Day'll Be Sunday By and By."—Cleveland (Ohio) Press, Sept. 17.
