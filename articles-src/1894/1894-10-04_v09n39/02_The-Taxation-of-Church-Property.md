THE young people who visit Toronto will be interested to know that the Jarvis Street Church refused to accept exemption of its fine church property from taxation. This is a practical emphasis of the position to which our Baptist views of the proper separation of Church and State must sooner or later lead us as a denomination. Undoubtedly, the taxation of all church properties would, at first, work hardships to the smaller churches, but the inconvenience of doing right can never be a reason for our staying on the wrong side of a great principle. We shall never fight Romanism with hands quite free until we as Protestants, one and all, refuse thus to receive State aid for religious purposes in any form, and exemption from taxation is really State aid in a veiled form.—Baptist Young People's Union.
