HOWEVER it may fare with her oppressors, the Church can afford to wait for justice, because she has all time at her disposal. If Premier Crispi has not actually arrived at Canossa, he is well on his way thither. His policy of warfare on religion and morality—against which honest Protestants themselves have protested—have created the dangers which now threaten his country, and from which only the Church can save her. Having done his best to make anarchists, he would now raise the cross between himself and his creatures.

This is the meaning of his call the other day of Naples for a union of forces against anarchism, under a banner inscribed, "For God, our King, and our Country."

But the Church must have freedom of action that she exert to the full her beneficent influence in the crisis through which the Italian government is passing; and that implies papal independence.

With the papal question unsettled, Rome remains the weak point of the Italian kingdom. Is Crispi beginning to see the necessity of sacrificing ill-gotten possession to secure true Italian unity?—The Pilot (Catholic), Sept. 22.
