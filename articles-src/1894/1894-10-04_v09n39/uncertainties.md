## OCR Corrections Made

### Page 1, Line 22
- **OCR read:** "A. F. BALLINGER, | - - - EDITORS."
- **Corrected to:** "A. F. BALLENGER, | - - - ASSISTANT EDITOR."
- **Reason:** Known editor name is A. F. Ballenger (not Ballinger), and he was assistant editor, not one of the main editors
- **Confidence:** HIGH

### Page 2, Line 50
- **OCR read:** "pops of Rome"
- **Corrected to:** "pope of Rome"
- **Reason:** Obvious typo; context clearly refers to singular pope
- **Confidence:** HIGH

### Page 2, Line 56
- **OCR read:** "vengerents"
- **Left as:** "vengerents"
- **Reason:** Unclear if this is an archaic spelling or OCR error; possible intended word is "vicegerents"
- **Confidence:** LOW

### Page 2, Line 56
- **OCR read:** "mules and bounds"
- **Left as:** "mules and bounds"
- **Reason:** Possible OCR error for "rules and bounds" but preserved as printed
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

### Page 5, Tables
- **Issue:** Multiple table formatting inconsistencies and unclear column headers
- **Action:** Preserved table data as presented in OCR output
- **Note:** Some denomination names in table appear corrupted (e.g., "ROMAN CATECULUS" likely should be "ROMAN CATHOLIC")
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - data preserved but accuracy uncertain

### Page 6, Line 293
- **OCR read:** "disas:ofaction"
- **Left as:** "disas:ofaction"
- **Reason:** Likely OCR error for "dissatisfaction" but preserved exactly as shown
- **Confidence:** LOW

### Page 7, Line 412
- **Note:** Long paragraph about religious agitation continues without obvious errors but some formatting may be uncertain

## General Notes
- Issue appears to be from Mistral OCR output
