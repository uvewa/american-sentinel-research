On another page we print a portion of a speech by Hon. W. S. Linton, member of Congress from the State of Michigan, on the bill "making appropriations for current and contingent expenses of the Indian Department and fulfilling treaty stipulations with various Indian tribes for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895, and for other purposes." It is this bill which makes appropriations for the "contract schools," or, in other words, the denominational schools, supported by the Government. The bill passed, and was approved Aug. 15, 1894. The figures given by Mr. Linton are valuable, and should be saved for future reference, as should also the figures given on page 302 of the SENTINEL of Sept. 27.
