BALTIMORE, Md., Sept. 21.—Bishop Keane, of the Catholic University, at Washington, arrived in Baltimore this evening from Rome, and is the guest of Cardinal Gibbons at the archiepiscopal residence. While in Rome, Bishop Keane had two long audiences with the pope.

"His holiness took a great interest in what was and had been going on in America," said the bishop. "He asked me about the church here, and about the political and economic conditions of this country. He wanted to know about the political struggles, and inquired about our labor troubles, and I found that he shared, to a great extent, the prevalent belief in Europe that the riots here were the outgrowth of Socialism, and foreshadowed a possible revolution. I relieved his mind on that point by telling him that, in this case, out of evil good was certain to come. His love for his eminence, Cardinal Gibbons, was very manifest from his talk Mgr. Satolli, too, shares the warmest affection of the pope. He is pleased with the acts of Mgr. Satolli since his appointment as the representative of his holiness in this country. Leo does not believe that either monarchical or imperial forms of government will be tolerated in the future, but that democracy will wield its sway. He regards America and France as the foremost and broadest types of that form of government. America he looks upon as the bulwark of the church.

"The relations between the Vatican and Quirinal," continued his grace, "have scarcely changed an iota in recent years. The pope is proof against influences brought to bear upon him to withdraw his influence from France and place it with the Triple Alliance. Humbert now realizes that he has been foolish in his attitude. The pope's standing on this point remains unchanged and he will die in the same policy he has all along maintained. Italy is bankrupt and on the verge of dissolution," said the bishop. "It is held together for the time by Germany. The latter has taken her loans again and again, but will not do so any more. The Italian national government, however, will never be broken up. It will become in the future, I suppose, a republic, with the pope having the undisputed gubernatorial privilege in the city of Rome. The pope was very much pleased to know that his eminence, Cardinal Gibbons, contemplated a visit to Rome."—Washington Post, Sept. 22, 1894.
