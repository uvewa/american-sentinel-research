THE Denver American an American Protective Association organ, notes the fact that the "Protestant ministers in St. Louis have begun the serious agitation of a serious question,"—namely, the taxation of Church property, and expresses the hope that such a measure will become a law, not only in Missouri, but in every State in the Union. The American is reckoning without a vast number of so-called Protestants, popish in principle, who practically demand State aid to religious institutions in the shape of exemption of ecclesiastical property from taxation.
