In a small town in Mississippi lives a Seventh-day Adventist school teacher, who is in the habit, on Sundays, of assisting his wife to do the family washing. This practical expression of conjugal affection on the first day of the week, seems to have shocked the religious sensibilities of the mayor of the town much as Sunday kissing is fabled to have affected the ancient New England authorities. The mayor has declared that the example which this thoughtful husband is setting must be suppressed, even if he has to arrest him himself.
