THE Sabbath Recorder is chasing rainbows and sees roseate hues in the moral sky. It thinks that persecution for conscience' sake is becoming less and less common. "A man in New York," says our contemporary, "was arrested last month for selling a two-cent shoe string on Sunday, and thrown into jail to await trial for his crime. But these instances are extremely rare as compared with the wicked assaults upon the liberties of good people in the earlier history of our country." The Recorder is simply mistaken. Such instances are increasing very rapidly, and he is an optimist indeed who cannot see that erelong every man who refuses to worship the papal beast by doing homage to the papal Sunday will be subject to just such assaults upon his liberty. The Recorder should not close its eyes to the inevitable as foretold in prophecy. Nor is this a pessimistic view. "All things work together for good to them that love God;" and when the powers of darkness seem about to triumph finally and forever, it is written that "at that time shall Michael stand up, the great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book."
