# Uncertainties Log - Volume 9, Number 3 (January 18, 1894)

## OCR Quality Assessment
The Mistral OCR transcription was of very high quality. The following minor corrections were made for obvious OCR errors:

### Page 2
- Line 107: "Fifteen Congress" appears to be an OCR error for "Fiftieth Congress" (context: Senate document citation)

### Page 5
- Line 375: "636,2.5" appears to be OCR error for "636,225" (Reformed Jewish Congregational property value in table)

### Page 7
- Line 417: "Plymouth Brethren III" - uncertain if "III" is correct or an OCR misreading

### Author Identification Notes
- **C. P. N.** (article "Study the Texts Again") - Author initials not in the known authors list. This may be a variant or error for C. P. B. (Calvin P. Bollman), but retained as written in OCR.
- **W. E. Howell** - Author of "Church and State and the Hawaiian Question" - not in the known authors list, appears to be a new contributor.

### General Notes
- All page headers (running titles, page numbers) were stripped as instructed
- Advertisements and subscription information on page 8 were skipped as instructed
- Article breaks and separators were clearly marked in the OCR output
- Block quotes and italicized text markers were preserved from OCR
- The table on pages 6-7 listing Ohio church property values was preserved with original formatting
