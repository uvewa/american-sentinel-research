"RABBI WILLNER, of Baltimore," says the Catholic Review, "is opposed to the project of public denominational schools, yet he sees the injustice of making the system practically Protestant. 'There has been,' he says, 'much one-sidedness in the discussion of the school question. The cry that the Catholics want to rule the country is only a bugbear. As a matter of fact the schools are not non-sectarian. This is utterly wrong. The proposed amendment to our Constitution is incompatible with Bible reading, the singing of Christian songs and the prominence given to Christianity in our schools. Those who are in accord with these should not throw stones.' Yes, so long as the Protestant translation of the Bible is read, the Protestant version of the Lord's prayer is recited, and Protestant hymns are sung, the public shoots are gloriously non-sectarian in the minds of some of the self-constituted protectors of 'American institution.' The Catholics and the Jews must not complain. If they do they are branded as unpatriotic."

There is certainly much truth in what the rabbi and the Review say; but the weakness of the Catholic position is in the fact that when the Protestant features complained of are eliminated from the schools, unless replaced by distinctively papal features, the schools are at once "godless." It is the case of the lamb and the wolf over again. What Rome wants is mutton. Whether the schools are above or below on the stream matters not to Rome; they muddy the water for her in any event, unless under her control. Rome is determined to dominate the public schools at any cost; but instead of making them secular, as they ought in justice to be, she will make them papal as they ought not to be.
