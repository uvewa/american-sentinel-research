The Christian Reformer, formerly the Political Dissenter, has in its issue of January 6, this editorial note, which we give entire:—

The AMERICAN SENTINEL, in commenting on the recent National Reform Convention, says that Rev. W. F. Crafts, who discussed "The Kingship of Christ," forgot to mention, or did not know, that while the Kingship and Savisurship are frequently mentioned in close connection, the two offices do not in fact run contemporaneously. It is when Christ comes again that he comes King of kings and Lord of hords. Christ is now a priest upon his Father's throne." Will the editors of the SENTINEL please study again the passages of scripture which speak of Christ's exaltation? The time is yet to come when all things shall yield obedience, but he is now Lord of all. "He must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet." The SENTINEL thinks he will not reign till this is done. Like Melchisedek he is a priest upon his (not his Father's) throne. Melchisedek was king of Salem while he was priest of the most high God.

Our most serious objection to this note is that it squarely contradicts the Scriptures. In Rev. 3:21 we have recorded the words of our Lord himself, telling us what throne he now occupies: "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne." Again in Heb. 8:1 we have this testimony: "Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens." This is positive but it is not all there is directly on this subject. Zech. 6:12,13 is equally conclusive: "Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, Behold the man [Christ] whose name is the BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the Lord [the Father]; even he [Christ] shall build the temple of the Lord; and shall bear the glory [of the Lord, the Father], and shall sit and rule upon his [the Father's] throne; and he [Christ] shall be a priest upon his [the Father's] throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both."

The present position of Christ cannot be mistaken by the devout student of the Scriptures. He is a priest upon his Father's throne; "and the counsel of peace" is "between them both." Says the apostle: "We have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need." Heb. 4:15, 16.

Thus it is seen the throne occupied jointly by the Father and by the Son is the throne from which mercy or grace is dispensed. It is plainly called "the throne of grace." And as there can be no throne without a kingdom, the text in effect asserts a kingdom of grace. In this kingdom Christ is a priest-king "after the order of Melchisedek." But Christ has not yet entered upon the possession of the dominion promised him as the seed of Abraham (Gal. 3:16 and Luke 1:21,32). The Jews would have taken him by force to make him king; and now National Reformers are attempting the same thing in effect, namely, to themselves seize civil power in Christ's name and to rule in his stead. But Christ has himself told us (Matt. 25:31-34), when he will take the kingdom: "When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: and before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divuleth his sheep from the goats: and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. Then shall the king say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world." Evidently the editor of the Christian Reformer should "study again the passages which speak of Christ's exaltation."
