LAST week we inadvertently credited to Ablegate Satolli a declaration of Pope Leo XIII., namely, that "what Rome has done for other countries she will do for the United States." The error was not vital. In either case it is an authoritative declaration of Rome's purpose concerning this country, and should alarm every patriot and every Christian. Rome has degraded both mentally and morally every country in which she bears sway, and she is already doing the same thing here.
