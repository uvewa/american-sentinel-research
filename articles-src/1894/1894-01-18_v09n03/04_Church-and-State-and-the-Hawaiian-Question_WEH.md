1. Is there any phase of the Hawaiian question into which the Church and State principle enters? 2. Has republicanism a divine right? 3. Will the United States become the moral and religious arbiter of the world? 4. Is this the mission of our Government? 5. What is the nation's present duty?

In answer to the first question it is sufficient to cite an extract from an article in the December number of the North American Review, entitled, "Our Present Duty," by the Hon. William M. Springer:—

The pretext for this intervention (with the government of the Hawaiian Islands) is based upon the alleged fact that the government of the queen of the Hawaiian Islands was a "semi-harbaric monarchy resting on no solid or moral foundation, dead in every thing but its vices, coarsely luxurious in its tastes and wishes, constantly sending out impure exhalations, and spreading social and political demoralization throughout the islands." This is the indictment made against the monarchy by the late minister, Mr. Stevens, who, after leaving the islands, further assails the government to which he was so recently accredited as a diplomatic representative, by charging that the queen has sustained scandalous and immoral relations with one of her ministers. This being the alleged condition of the government of Hawaii, an appeal is made to the moral sentiment of the American people to justify the overthrow of that government and establish in its stead what its friends and supporters have denominated "a Christian government," by which we may assume, is meant a government whose administrators profess the Christian religion.

It may be freely said that this is but one, and among the first, of the perplexing diplomatic questions which the Government of the United States will be called upon to settle, now that she has enlisted herself in the crusade of the nineteenth century, first, by denominating herself a "Christian nation," and then, by her "Christian" legislation in ordering the gates of the World's Fair closed on Sunday, to preserve the sanctity of that day.

While important considerations, other than the moral phase of the Hawaiian question, arise, it is nevertheless true that one of the main, if not the main prop of Ex-Minister Stevens' plea for annexation, rests upon morality or "Christian civilization," as any one will readily conclude by reading his "Plea for Annexation," in the December number of the North American Review. The opening sentence of this plea is:—

A grave question is now before the American people, the wrong solution of which will deeply affect the recent standing of the United States before the world; followed by the question, "Will the American nation stand by its century's record in favor of republican government and of free Christian civilization, or will it repudiate its past by using its power to murder its offspring and to stamp out the reforming work of pure and noble men and women who have made the Hawaiian Islands what they are, thus following the once infamous example of the Austrian Hapsburgs in stifling the noble aspirations of Italy and Hungary?"

So, according to Mr. Stevens, the grave question before the American people in regard to the Hawaiian annexation, is its "moral standing," and whether it will maintain its record in favor of "free Christian civilization," or follow the "infamous example of the Austrian Hapsburgs." The truth of the relation of the Austrian Hapsburgs to Italy and Hungary was whether Austria or Italy should be its own pope and oppress the other; and whether Hungary should maintain national Protestantism or whether the papal house of Hapsburgs should domineer. So they went to war over these questions and Austria gained supremacy over Italy for the time being, and put down Protestantism in Hungary.

Now, shall the United States "stifle the noble aspirations" of Hawaii by letting her alone, or shall she compel her to become "Christianized"? While Mr. Stevens himself would follow the "infamous example" of the Hapsburgs, in persuading the United States Government to enforce "Christianity" upon Hawaii, which is the papal principle and ought not to be supported, yet is it not a difficult question for the United States to settle and be consistent with the position to which she has committed herself in national compulsory Christianizing? Isn't Stevens' plea consistent with our nation's recent conduct in religious legislation? And isn't she bound to listen to his plea or repudiate this religious legislation to which she has committed herself and shake herself clear of it? Can she not see that in transforming her republican and liberty-loving character to that of a religious despot, she has taken a long step downward toward decay and ruin, and that she has committed herself to a course which will inevitably lead her to destruction?

As further evidence that morality is one of the mainstays of Mr. Stevens' plea for annexation, read the following extract from President Cleveland's message to Congress on the Hawaiian question, which shows that he not only recognized the moral side of Stevens' plea, but even regards it the most prominent and places it first in characterizing that plea. Speaking of Stevens, he says: "He addressed a long letter to the Secretary of State, in which the case for annexation was elaborately argued on moral, political and economical grounds." It is rather significant that the President does not, in this message, antagonize this phase of Stevens' plea.

The national Government has not granted and may not grant Stevens' plea, on the basis of morality or on any basis, but she is bound to meet questions of this very nature at every turn she makes henceforth.

The question as to whether the American nation will "stand by its century's record in favor of republican government," introduces our second question, "Has republicanism a divine right?" Let Hon. Mr. Springer answer in the forcible language of the same able article referred to:—

There is no divine right of republicanism in this world, any more than there is a divine right of kings. The divinity in all these matters is in the right of the people to govern themselves. Our own right to self-government is no more sacred than the right of the handful of ignorant Hawaiians in the Sandwich Islands to govern themselves. If they prefer a monarchy, feeble and inefficient though it may be, it is their business, and not ours.

But, now, since the Government has decided that the individual has no right to govern himself in matters of religion, but that he must obey the dictates of this "Christian nation," does it not logically and inevitably follow that the same principle will permeate her diplomatic attitude toward other nations? If this be a "Christian nation," then, since it is republican, is not republicanism Christianity? And if this "Christian nation" can enforce Christianity, can it not enforce republicanism? This is a logical result of the assumption of this nation that it is Christian, and hence can regulate Christian practices.

Will the United States become the moral and religious arbiter of the world? Hon. Mr. Springer has the following to say:—

But it is claimed that the provisional government is one composed of Christians, and that they are representatives of advanced civilization. The United States, being a Christian nation, should sympathize with and render moral and material aid in sustaining that government; and it is alleged that we have no right to consent to its overthrow. It may be conceded, for the sake of argument, that the provisional government is composed of Christians, and that it more nearly corresponds to our ideas of a just government than does the government of the monarchy; but, as suggested before, this is foreign to the controversy. We have no more right to interfere on this ground with the government of Hawaii than we have to interfere with the government of China or Japan or Turkey, none of which are Christian or administered by Christian statesmen, and none of which, we have a right to assume, are any more just to the subjects of such government than is the monarchy of Hawaii to its subjects.

Such a claim would make the United States the moral and religious arbiter of the world; would constitute us self-appointed crusaders, going about the earth pulling down and destroying alleged beathers and semi-barbaric monarchies, and establishing Christian governments and civilization in their stead.

This language is clear and forcible, and the argument is invincible, yet it cannot be accepted by the United States Government, because it has already assumed the right to interfere with the Christianity of the individual, and in order to be consistent with itself it must assume the right to interfere with governments or nations, and hence cannot accede to Mr. Springer's argument, whatever weight it might have had upon Congress before it enlisted in this religious warfare. Congress cannot ignore Mr. Stevens' plea. Having adopted the papal principle, it cannot reject a measure based upon it, without repudiating this principle and retracting its course directed by it. Unless it does retract its course it is destined to become a moral and religious arbiter whenever diplomatic questions arise involving the services of one.

Is this the mission of our Government?

President Cleveland says in the message referred to:—

If national honesty is to be disregarded and a desire for territorial extension, or dissatisfaction with a form of government not our own, ought to regulate our conduct, I have entirely misapprehended the mission and character of our Government and the behavior which the conscience of our people demands of their public servants.

Hon. Mr. Springer says:—

This is not the mission of our Government. Whether the government of Hawaii was a just one, a moral one, or an efficient one, is a matter which does not concern the American people. We have no more right to overthrow a monarchy in Hawaii because it does not conform to our ideas of a just government, than we have to overthrow a monarchy in Canada or Great Britain, or Russia or Turkey, or Spain or elsewhere. If we have any concern as to the imperfection of these so-called barbaric governments, we may send our missionaries to them to convert them to our religion or send our statesmen among them to convince them of the superior advantages of our form of government. But to send our naval forces to the ports of other governments, to land them upon their soil, and to allow them to be used for the purpose of overthrowing, in connection with foreign subjects or aliens, the established government would make our Christianity a fraud and our boasted republicanism a mockery.

What will she do?
