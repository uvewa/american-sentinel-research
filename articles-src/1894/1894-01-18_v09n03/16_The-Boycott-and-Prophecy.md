THE Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has rendered a decision that in that State the boycott is sometimes lawful. This prepares the way for the religious boycott foretold in Rev. 13:16, 17: "And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name." The beast is the papacy. The Sunday is set forth by Rome herself as the badge or mark of her authority. The mark in the right hand is outward homage to this papal institution. The mark in the forehead is the consent of the mind, deliberately choosing the Sunday of the beast rather than the Sabbath of the Lord.
