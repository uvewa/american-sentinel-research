Some of the American Protective Association papers are publishing a cartoon representing Uncle Sam asleep in his chair, while papal ecclesiastics are rifling his safe, destroying the Constitution, tearing to pieces the Declaration of Independence and burning such books as Swinton's History. There is much truth in the picture, but it lacks one important feature: apostate Protestantism in the person of National Reformers and American Sabbath Unionists should be pictured as holding a sponge saturated with chloroform, to Uncle Sam's nose, while his house is being pillaged. Without this feature the delineation of current history is incomplete.
