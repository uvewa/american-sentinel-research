The New York Voice, very religious, and fanatically prohibitive, is nevertheless in some degree amenable to reason and in a measure susceptible to the promptings of the spirit of justice. Referring to the persecution of the Adventists in Maryland and other Southern States, it says:

These people are, we assume, sincere in there religious beliefs, and they are said to be unusually orderly and law-abiding. It is a serious question whether the Sunday law should not be flexible enough to grant such men, who conscientiously observe another day as the Sabbath, the right to engage in work in their own fields, where they disturb the religious devotion of nobody else.

It is a serious question indeed, but we wish to ask Rev. Mr. Funk whether those only who believe in some holy day have any rights on Sunday? If the Free-thinker who engages in work in his own fields, where he "disturbs the religious devotion of nobody else," is to be fined or imprisoned, while for the Adventist, who takes Saturday for his holy day, the law is to be made "flexible enough" to secure him immunity if he works on Sunday, what becomes of the equality of citizens before the law? What becomes of religious liberty when one man's belief gives him opportunities which the lack of that belief denies to his neighbor? What has belief to do with work or play on Saturday, or Sunday, or Monday, except in so far as the individual has scruples which impel him to voluntarily abstain from either or both? What constitutional right has law to make any inquiry regarding the religious belief of the American citizen? Will Mr. Funk answer these questions? One thing, at least, he should tell his readers, and that is that the Adventists have never asked for the suspension of the Sunday laws for their benefit because they keep Saturday. They demand their unconditional repeal as being not only unjust but a factor of Church and State union, and therefore unconstitutional.—Truth Seeks.
