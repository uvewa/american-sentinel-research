A SEVENTH-DAY Adventist on Norfolk Island, South Pacific Ocean, was recently summoned to appear before the "spiritual court" to answer to the charge of cooking on Sunday! the venerable day of the sun, the "Christian" Sabbath of the papacy. News also comes to us from Canada of arrests for Sunday work by Adventists, painting a wagon tongue, etc. The exaltation and enforcement of Sunday is not confined to the United States; for it is written: "All that dwell on the earth shall worship him [the papal beast], whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world."
