A society has been organized in this city for the purpose of securing among Hebrews a better observance of the ancient Sabbath. Commenting on this fact, the Mail and Express says:—

It has been offered as an explanation, if not an excuse, for Jewish dereliction in this respect [the observance of the Sabbath] that they have become so assimilated to our American habits and customs that they have gradually fallen into a sort of passive observance of the Christian Sabbath. It is no doubt more the result of the long-continued observance of the Christian Sabbath enforced by law, so far as trade and traffic are concerned, connected with the business and social inconvenience of two rest days in each week.

We cannot accept this result as a compliment. There are unquestionably a large number of Jews who have become Christians, and when this change of faith is the result of sincere conviction we cannot refuse our sympathy and fellowship. But it is equally true that our own example in this matter of Sabbath observance is none too good. It is to be feared that many of our Jewish friends have been seduced from their religious fidelity by our moral and religious recreancy and degeneracy.

To take from any man a religious belief in which he has been sincere and devoted, without giving him something more satisfactory as a substitute, is both cruel and wicked. It is therefore much better for the Jew to yield a loving and reverential observance of his own Sabbath than to lapse into a spirit of sheer worldliness and simply accord a reluctant and legally enforced observance of the Christian Sabbath, for which he has no reverence, and in which he can have no religious interest while holding to the faith whose precepts he violates.

The Jewish Sabbath, faithfully observed, as in the past; one of the busiest days of the week, taken voluntarily from trade; with stores, shops, and ledgers closed; the synagogue thronged and resounding with prayer and praise, has always impressed us with the strength of religious convictions and the force and beauty of religious devotion.

These are remarkable utterances for a paper which has for years championed legislation, the very purpose and effect of which is to do the very thing which the Mail and Express says "is both cruel and wicked." The man who closes his store on the "Jewish" Sabbath loses the business of the busiest day of the week. This, however, some Jews and all Sabbath-keeping Christians in trade, do voluntarily. But here the law steps in and requires them to lose the next day also in order that Sunday keepers may not be "compelled" to keep their stores open on Sunday also! Thus the State discriminates in favor of the so-called Christian Sabbath (which is, in fact, the papal Sabbath—the badge of the authority of the Roman Catholic Church) to the amount of 16½ per cent; that is the man who voluntarily closes his store or shop on the Sabbath, is required by the civil law to pay tribute to the papacy to the amount of one-sixth of his remaining time, by observing also the Sunday, the Sabbath of the "Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth." And the Mail and Express defends such legislation and demands the rigid enforcement of such laws!

But note particularly the closing paragraph of the quotation from the Mail and Express:—

The Jewish Sabbath, faithfully observed as in the past; one of the busiest days of the week, taken voluntarily from trade; with stores, shops, and ledgers closed; the synagogue thronged and resounding with prayer and praise, has always impressed us with the strength of religious convictions and the force and beauty of religious devotion.

Would not a similar voluntary sacrifice on the part of Sunday keepers make a similar impression? and would not the religion represented by those who made such voluntary sacrifice be the gainer by it in moral influence? But where is the chance for it when the civil law stops the wheels of commerce on that day and commands the laborer to rest in order that Christians may obey the demands of their religion, that is that Christians may be Christians indeed? Is it any wonder that the "Christianity" which must be hedged about with civil law to preserve it against the assaults of greed, fails to command much respect from the adherents of other faiths? All so-called Sabbath laws, except the one divine law of the Sabbath, are not only of papal origin and for the maintenance of a papal institution, but they foster hypocrisy and deceit and put a premium on selfishness. Their purpose is to fill the churches, and they, in a measure, accomplish their purpose by filling the churches with hypocrites—men and women who have not the courage of their convictions and who would not live their religion or observe their so-called Sabbath, were they not by the civil law shielded from loss in so doing.
