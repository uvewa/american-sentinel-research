The idea that Christianity must be "protected" by the State is so common in these days, that even the Baptists, who have always been in the front ranks of the advocates of religious liberty, are falling into the error. Thus, in noticing a pamphlet from the pen of Sir Theodore Hope, formerly of the Council of the Governor General of India, the Freeman says:—

Sir Theodore is dissatisfied with the amount of support given by the State to Christianity in India. We are glad he does not advocate the establishment of the Church of England in that part of the British Empire. So far as we are concerned, we should be glad if the State ceased to show the least favor to any church or clergy, but dealt out to all the same measure of protection in the exercise of undoubted rights and of the religious freedom to which every subject of the British crown is entitled. At the same time we agree that the State should provide the ministrations of religion for those of its servants that are withdrawn from their homes and placed in localities where, without such provision, they would be deprived of these ministrations. But in the appointment of chaplains or ministers in these instances no denomination should enjoy advantages or suffer disadvantages more than any other denomination. Beyond this the State should not go, and within these limits the State should act with caution.

"Protection" is necessary for false systems of religion, for they could not exist without it. Since they originate with man, of course they must be upheld by human power. A religion without power, is no religion at all; and a religion that does not come from God, and does not have him to support it, must necessarily derive its power from the State. The very fact that a religion asks and receives the protection of the State, shows that the State is above it; for the greater never seeks protection from the less. That which is protected is weaker than that which protects.

This obvious fact also shows that when men ask for State protection of Christianity, they have lost sight of its divine origin. They must have forgotten that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation, or else they could not ask human protection for it. For the State to offer its protection to Christianity, or for ministers of the gospel to ask for it, or even to consent to receive such protection in behalf of Christianity, is an insult to its Founder.

There is but one thing that the religion of Christ asks from men, and that is that they should put themselves under its protection. It is not in the world asking favors, but giving them.

Who can read the second Psalm, and then talk about State protection of anything pertaining to the gospel of God? Let us read: "Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his Anointed, saying, Let us break their bands assunder, and cast away their cords from us. He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh; the Lord shall have them in derision."

This shows that the kingdom of God has nothing to fear from earthly rulers. All the powers of earth in combination cannot destroy it; their thoughts of injuring it are nothing but vanity. But if they have no power to injure it, neither have they any power to protect it. For example, a great power like that of England, would laugh at a declaration of war against it by some petty tribe in Africa; what an absurdity it would be, therefore, for it to ask the protection of that same petty tribe. That is the way the case stands with the religion of Jesus Christ and earthly governments, only the difference is infinitely greater. Therefore the Lord says, "Be wise now, therefore, O ye kings; be instructed, ye judges of the earth." Instead of ministers of the gospel asking for the protection of kings, they are instructed to offer to all men, including kings, the protection of God, if they will receive it.

A word as to the duty of the State to provide the ministrations of religion to those who are withdrawn from their homes. It can indeed provide the ministrations of religion to such ones, but it cannot provide the ministrations of the Christian religion. The State cannot give that which it has not; and the State has not the gospel, for the gospel is the power of God. Therefore whenever the State goes into the business of providing the ministrations of religion, it can at best provide nothing but a modification of Christianity,—a form of godliness without the power.

What then shall be done for those who are withdrawn from their homes and placed where there are no churches to which they can have access? The answer is, Let the true ministers of Christ seek them out, and minister to them, if they will receive such ministration. Christ came to seek and to save that which was lost, and it is the duty of his followers to do likewise. If men in such places do not wish the ministrations of religion, then they are not to be forced to receive it by the State. Christ came to proclaim liberty; and freedom to accept the gospel, means freedom to reject it; and this Christ gives to every man. But no minister can adequately proclaim the liberty wherewith Christ makes men free, when he has so limited an idea of that liberty that he thinks it needs the protection of the civil power.—Present Truth, London, Eny.
