A BILL has been introduced into the Kentucky legislature designed to destroy the American Protective Association. It prohibits the organization or continuance of societies whose object is to discriminate between Christians on account of their religion. The penalty is a fine of $500 to $1,000 or imprisonment from six to twelve months, or both. But why prohibit discrimination only as between Christians?
