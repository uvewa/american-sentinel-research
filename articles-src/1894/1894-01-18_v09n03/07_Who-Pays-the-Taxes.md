The following is a complete list of the religious denominations owning property in the State of Ohio, together with the value of their holdings. These figures are from the Allied American, of Cleveland, Ohio, and are significant when we realize that this property, amounting to nearly forty-two millions of dollars, is exempt from taxation:—

Of the sum total of this property and its exemption from its just share of taxation, the Kansas City American says:—

What an enormous sum! How many laborers would have to bunch their property to equal that figure if each one was worth $2,000? You will be surprised at the number. We find it would equal the holdings of 20,997 laboring men. Think of it! Nearly 21,000. If each State equalled the Ohio record there would be nearly $2,000,000,000 worth of untaxed Church property in the United States, which would equal the holdings of more than 1,000,000 laboring men; of more than 500,000 merchants or of more than 1,000,000 farmers. While some of the States are not so unfortunate, some of them are even worse off, and from the above figures we believe the people will soon have to cast about for a remedy, or awaken some day and find the country in the same condition England was at one time, in the same predicament that Mexico and France were, and in the same position every country has found itself which has granted Church property immunity from taxation. In such countries the Church grew richer and the people poorer until the government found it necessary to confiscate the holdings of the church in order to perpetuate or lengthen its own existence.

True the trouble in those countries was due to the insatiable greed of the Roman Catholic Church; and you may say there is no immediate danger from that church in this country. . . . Let us review the table published in the Allied American.

We find there are seventy-six denominations in the State of Ohio holding $41,993,357 worth of property, and that the Roman Catholic Church holds more than one-sixth of the whole amount. In other words, the Roman Catholic Church holds $7,395,640 or more than the Immanuel Synod (Lutheran), the Presbyterian Church (in all its branches), the Salvation Army, the Seventh-day Baptists, the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran, the Orthodox Jewish, the Primitive Methodist, the Reformed Jewish, the Christian Scientists, the German Augsburg Synod (Lutheran), and the Spiritualists—more than all these combined. The Roman Church owns more property than the Wesleyan Methodist, the Reformed Episcopal, the Congregational Churches, the Protestant Episcopal, the Methodist Protestant, the Free Methodist, the A. M. E. Zion, the Free Will Baptists, the Regular Baptist (North), the Society of Shakers, the Society of Separatists, and the Reformed Church in America. In fact, the Roman Church has more property in Ohio than sixty-four of the seventy-five denominations reported. The holdings of these sixty-four denominations only aggregate $6,837,280, while the total holdings of the Church of Rome reach the enormous figure of $7,395,640. Of the ten remaining denominations the Church of Rome is possessed of more property than one-half of them combined. To be plain, the Church of Rome owns $7,395,640 worth of property and five of the remaining denominations own but $6,497,817 worth. She has more than three of the five remaining denominations and $138,480 worth more than one-half of the combined holdings of the remaining two denominations, and enrolled by but one.

In the face of these figures what sane man will contend that there is no danger to the country if the hoarding of the Roman Catholic Church is allowed to go on unchecked; in fact, if we continue to pay her a premium to accumulate and hold vast and valuable tracts of land? The weaker denominations will not object to their property being assessed, but Rome will fight for immunity from taxation to the end. She will resort to anything in order to defeat men who may be nominated for office who favor the taxation of Church property.

A few years more of crafty scheming by the Church of Rome, a few years of inactivity by Protestants, and the liberties which they pretend to prize so highly will be a mere faint recollection. Liberty will be defined obedience; religious toleration will be measured by the Inquisition; and free speech will mean "that which the church authorizes." Would this suit you?—It would not. Then your duty is plain. Take care of your birthright.

But will the American people heed the warning? Will they take care of their birthright? Will they?

The evil complained of is a gigantic one; but is Rome alone at fault? How about the larger amount of untaxed property held by the Methodist Episcopal Church? And why is nothing said about that immense sum? If, as is intimated by the American, the willingness to pay taxes decreases in direct ratio to the increase of the value of the exempt holdings, the Methodists must be more unwilling to pay their just share of the taxes than are the Catholics. And if the evil, as is also intimated, is proportional to the value of the exempted property, is not the Methodist Episcopal Church in Ohio, the greater sinner? But we do not think that the evil is to be determined in any such way. The principle is wrong: One of the denominations named has officially admitted this, namely, the Seventh-day Adventists; and at their General Conference, in Battle Creek, Mich., last March, they passed a resolution declaring in favor of the taxation of Church property, and expressing their willingness to bear their just proportion of the burden of supporting civil institutions. Will the Methodists be as truly Protestant?
