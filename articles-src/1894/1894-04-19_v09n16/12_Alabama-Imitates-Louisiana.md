The following dispatch, from Birmingham, Ala., will set people thinking whether we live in America or Russia. Read and be astonished:—

BIRMINGHAM, ALA., Mar. 24.—Troy, Ala., is excited over whitecap notices which have been received by mail by prominent Jewish merchants of that town. The notices are confined to the Jews, nearly all of whom have received them. A notice received by Levin & Sons, says:—

GREHN: This is warning for you to leave the city. We will give you until May 15th to wind up your business and get out of the city. After that date if you are caught in the city you will be dealt with as snakes are. You know our rule is never to give second warning but to act, therefore do not let your friends persuade you to stay. W. A. W. W.

P. C. D. F. A. W., President.

A notice received by Rosenberg Bros., says unless they leave by May 15th, they will be hanged by the neck. The citizens are highly indignant over the outrages. Troy is a town of 5,000 inhabitants.

The Governor of Alabama, to his credit be it said, has taken every precaution to prevent fanatical outrages. The United States authorities have also been notified. We should not wonder in the least if some of our threatened co-religionists in the sunny South should pack up and leave.—*Jewish Times and Observer*, April 6, 1894.
