WORD has come from Jackson, Tenn., that the appeal case of M. B. Capps to the Supreme Court of Tennessee from the circuit court of Weakley County, where he was convicted under the statute against Sunday labor, has failed to come up as expected because of the loss of the papers and record of the case in the lower court. If the papers are found, the case, it is expected, will be set for the middle of May.
