YES.

The character of a stream is most surely and thoroughly known by tracing it to its source. By this we ascertain its component parts, and learn the frame-work, as it were, on which is built the entire thing. There are often, it is true, accumulations and accretions, which serve to hide the real nature of the elements derived from the fountain; but this fact only makes more apparent the necessity for such thorough investigation as leads to the primary cause or source whence the thing we seek to know comes.

In this way we may best investigate this broad and intensely interesting question of Government favors bestowed upon religious bodies, whether it consists in placing the name of the being whom they worship in the Constitution, using their text book in the public schools, relieving their property from taxation, or paying the salaries of their ministers all of which are steps in the same direction, links in the same chain of bondage with which so many nations have been bound, and are still bound to-day.

We do not yet in this land have them all, but we have some of them; and there is a large and persistent class of religionists, who are determined that we shall have them all. The subject is therefore a proper one for thought and discussion.

The basis of State action looking to the bestowment of any favors upon religious bodies, such as we have mentioned, is the belief, still surviving in our own land, that the State should have something to say about religion. If this is not true, whence comes the idea that it may properly discriminate between public property and say concerning one part of it, "that is used for a religious purpose and need not bear any portion of the national burden in the way of taxes, and that is not used for a religious purpose and must therefore be taxed." If the Government, as such, has a right so to discriminate in favor of religious people where they are in the ascendancy, and relieve them of their share of the Government burden thus making the irreligious people bear more than their share, why is it unjust for governments where non-believers are the most numerous to place the heavier burden of taxation upon the believers and thus relieve from such burden the non-believers? Is there any difference in the principle applied in both cases? Is not one application of it equally as just as the other? Is it not as just to relieve the Mohammedan by imposing an extra burden upon the Christian, as to relieve the Christian by imposing an extra burden upon the Mohammedan? If church property is relieved of taxation, other property must be taxed that much higher in order to meet the expenses of the Government; so the State holds out a financial inducement to investment in religious property.

We might, however, endure the clear injustice involved in the discrimination as to property, but for the fact that it paves the way for a still greater and more vital discrimination with reference to principle and personal freedom of action in the choice of religion. Discrimination with reference to church property, argues a right to discriminate with reference to anything that belongs to the Church as contradistinguished from what belongs to that portion of mankind not of the Church. This involves a legal construction of the term church, in which there must necessarily be an investigation of rites, ordinances, forms of worship, authority, etc. So, religious people, by accepting at the Government's hands the favor of freedom from taxation for their churches, and other church property, have not only tacitly conceded the Government's right to discriminate with reference to property and determine which is and which is not church property, and hence what is and what is not a church; but have also logically conceded to the same political power the right to make still further and keener discriminations touching the religious liberties of the people in matters of conscience and forms of worship.

No people can be said to be entirely free, if while faithful to the government, they are placed at any disadvantage by reason of personal opinions touching matters over which the government proposes to have no control. But so long as freedom from taxation is granted to church property, while other public property is taxed, those holding the non-taxable public property have an advantage over those holding the taxable public property, which is granted to them for no other reason than that they hold a certain opinion, or profess to hold it, touching the subject of religion. So long as this is the case, can we say that thought is unfettered touching the subject of religion, and that a man's opinions thereon do not affect his standing in the government? One class are successful candidates for government favor; the other class to an equal extent are made to feel the government's disfavor, and all because of a difference of opinion touching religion. If men's property may be favored because of their religion, the men themselves may be favored for the same reason. The precedent is a dangerous one, and its danger should not be unknown.—*Independent Patriot*, Lamoni, Iowa.
