DURING the past month an amendment was introduced in the House of Representatives by Mr. Morse, and in the United States Senate by Mr. Frye, proposing the acknowledgment of God and Christ in the Constitution.

The people represented by the movers of said amendment are making strenuous efforts to accomplish their end, and it becomes a solemn, imperative duty to those realizing the danger involved in the proposed change to raise their voices in opposition in unmistakable terms.

The meaning and object of the proposed amendment cannot be misunderstood. It is an entering wedge for the establishment of a union of Church and State. It is to render subservient to the demands and dictates of some particular religious denomination a Government hitherto free and independent, and untrammeled by any influences that have no bearing upon the secular interests common to all the people of this wide land. It is an attempt which, if successful, would place a stumbling block in the way of a continued healthful and harmonious development of our national Government. It is a menace to personal freedom, a death blow aimed at the highest and most treasured privilege of the citizens of a free land—religious liberty.

Let us calmly and dispassionately consider the question from various points of view.

The framers of our Constitution omitted from it any reference to dogmas and beliefs of any religious sect or creed. Was such an omission unwise? Did it not rather leave our national Government free from any harassing entanglement in sectarian issues, free to devote its undivided attention to the peaceable advancement of those interests in which all the people, without regard to religious belief, were equally concerned?

Or was that omission in any wise harmful or detrimental to the cause of religion and its development? On the contrary, it proved an inestimable benefit for the prosperous, because free, unhindered, peaceful growth of all the various creeds into which the heterogeneous mass of the American people is divided. During the last hundred years a great nation's reverence and love for a Constitution proclaiming freedom of thought and action did not prevent, but rather stimulated that deep sense of religious reverence and devotion that may be said to be peculiar to the American people. Nowhere on the face of the globe has the cause of religion secured a firmer hold than at the firesides and within the hearts of the people of this free Republic. Side by side, in ever increasing numbers, cathedrals and churches, temples and synagogues, silently but eloquently proclaim a prevailing religious tendency, deep enough to ever spread its ennobling influences, and at the same time, broad enough to fully and cheerfully recognize the God-given, glorious privilege of freedom of mind and conscience. Only under a free Constitution, guaranteeing equal rights to all, to the exclusion of none, such results could be obtainable.

Or was that omission, we may furthermore ask, in any way sinful or wicked? Did it bring down upon our nation the wrath and anger of an offended Deity, which now, after a hundred years, it becomes the duty of pious men to appease by the proposed amendment? Unparalleled in the history of the world has been the progress and prosperity of our nation. The gracious love and mercy of Almighty God has favored a nation that wisely engrafted upon its statute books the underlying principle of all religion: Love of man, justice, and equity!

I make bold to declare that the adoption of that amendment would render us unworthy of the divine favor we hitherto enjoyed, for it would imply a flagrant violation of the sacred principles to which as a nation, we heretofore adhered. Especially is the recognition of the divinity of Christ contrary not alone to the First Amendment to our Constitution, declaring that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion," but also to the very preamble in which it is proposed to be inserted: "We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, . . . and secure the blessing of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution of the United States."

There are millions of true, law-abiding citizens in this country, Jews as well as non-Jews, unexcelled in their love for and allegiance to the country of their birth or adoption, dissenting from that proposition of the proposed amendment. And an adoption thereof would prove the opposite of insuring domestic tranquillity, the opposite of establishing justice and securing the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity; a high-handed measure, indeed, destined to throw the firebrand of ever-increasing dissensions between creed and creed, utterly incompatible with American fairness, statesmanship, and patriotism. Futile attempts have been made again and again to establish a union between Church and State by various propositions. The introduction of this amendment appears a clumsy effort to attain all desired ends by one bold sweep. Its adoption—which is hardly to be feared—would logically lead to more or less direct abrogations of the rights of nonconformists and their, at least, partial disfranchisement. It would reverse the wheel of progress, even to those dark days when the Pilgrim fathers, forgetful of their own bitter experiences, would not extend to others the religious liberty they had sought for themselves.

May our zealous friends realize that their leaning upon the strong arm of government for the support of religious dogmas may be so construed as to point to the weakness of their cause, to their inability to strengthen or uphold it by the power of persuasion and conviction. The Czar of Russia may glory in unifying the consciences of his subjects by the strong arm of State laws and at the point of the bayonet. Our political friendships for holy Russia should not carry us so far as to prompt us to adopt the methods of her supreme autocrat.

Let our good Christian friends rather adhere to the principle laid down by the founder of their religion: "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's!" Let them desist from mixing politics with religion. Let Church and State forever remain separate, and our country will continue to prosper; and the various denominations, working side by side, hand in hand, peacefully and harmoniously, will thus be best enabled, each in their own way, to improve the manhood and womanhood, the moral and spiritual welfare of the masses, instilling into all hearts love and reverence for God, law, and religion, without the need or aid of any reference to God and religious dogma in the fundamental law of our Constitution.

The inviolable sacredness of that document has been recognized by our brightest minds and noblest patriots. Handed down to us by the fathers as a sacred legacy, tried for more than a century and never found wanting, it must be preserved at all hazards in its pristine purity. And as Americans and as Jews we shall ever solemnly protest, as we do now, against any attempted encroachment upon the fundamental principles of our Constitution, fervently joining in the warning cry that arises in its behalf from millions of loyal hearts: "Hands off! Touch not mine anointed!"—*Rev. L. Stern*, in *Jewish Messenger*.
