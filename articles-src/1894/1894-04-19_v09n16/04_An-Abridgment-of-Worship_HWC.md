Civil government, according to both the Constitution of the United States and the gospel of the Man of Calvary, has no rights but civil rights; therefore, no right whatsoever to abridge the worship of Almighty God by any person.

The First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States declares: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." Jesus Christ says: "Render therefore unto Caesar (civil government) the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's." The worship of every man, if he desires to worship, is due the Lord, and should be rendered to him, without molestation or interference in the least from the State.

It has so often been averred by would-be advocates of religious liberty, but in spirit truly Jesuitical, that to prohibit common labor upon the first day of the week, even by fine and imprisonment, although the supposed offenders had rested the seventh day, both physically and spiritually, according to the example of Christ Jesus, is not religious persecution or an abridgment of individual worship.

Note that there are three classes of worshipers. The heathen are true worshipers of false gods; the hypocrite is a false worshiper of the true God. The Christian is a true worshiper of the true God. Not to enter into the realm of discussion of the constituent parts of the religion or worship of the heathen or the hypocrite, but only that of the Christian; the Christian knows that his religion is good for seven days in each week. It is not a removable thing that can be worn one day in the week, like a Sunday garb, and then laid upon the shelf the other six, to become covered with dust, but is kept in daily use. To illustrate: When the consistent Christian has worshiped upon the seventh day, according to his conscience and the divine text-book, by resting both physically and spiritually, then there remains six days in which he, as a Christian, is in duty bound, and has a God-given right, to worship, both according to conscience and the example of Christ Jesus. His worship thenceforth consists in continuing to rest spiritually in Christ, and laboring physically as did the great Exemplar. Paul says: "Whatsoever you do, do all to the glory of God," and to do so is worship.

Now, for the civil government to prohibit any from working upon the first day of the week, after having rested upon the seventh day, as before stated, is truly religious persecution. An abridgment of his God-given right to worship; also dictating his religion,—hence actuated by the same evil spirit of the Church of Rome—that spirit which God will destroy.
