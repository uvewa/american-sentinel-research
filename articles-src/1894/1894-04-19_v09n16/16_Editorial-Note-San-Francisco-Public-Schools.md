THE Board of Education of San Francisco has pending before it the question of the use in the public schools of "Myers' General History," a decided protest against it as a text-book having been made by the Roman Catholics. The facts of history are of course unpalatable to the Roman Catholic Church, and so the demand is made that those facts be suppressed. Catholicism may succeed in this protest. Can those who favor the teaching of religion in the public schools fail to see that if Rome can exercise so much control now, how much more will the schools be directed by her hand when religion has been made a part of their accepted course of study?
