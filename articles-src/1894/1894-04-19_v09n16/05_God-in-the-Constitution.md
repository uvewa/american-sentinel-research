At intervals for a half a century or over the movement to introduce God into the Federal Constitution has shown a good deal of passing activity. Just at this time it has been revived, and certain ministers of the gospel are intent on having the periodical discussion of the subject renewed.

It is understood that the expression decided on to introduce into the text of the Constitution is the following: "In God's appointed way, through Jesus Christ." These words would certainly give the instrument the necessary Christian character, although it is hard to see what effect they would have one way or another on the religious sense of the nation. The American Constitution would have a Christian label attached to it, and nominally, at least, the Americans would thereafter be a Christian people. This much we are now, so that the gain even in that direction does not seem quite palpable.

The great objection to the proposal in question is that it opens the door to still further amendments in that behalf, and that in their zeal for religion the several Christian sects may in time come to consider whether some one or more of them are not entitled to constitutional recognition; for surely, if the Christian religion itself is entitled to recognition in the Constitution, should it happen that any very large proportion of Americans in the future were found professing one of the creeds, it would not be altogether wrong to expect that the adherents of that creed would regard themselves as representing all there was of Christian faith worthy of being embodied in the Constitution.

In many of the colonies one or another of the sects was recognized as the State religion. In Virginia the Church of England was the established faith until Thomas Jefferson brought about the conditions which put an end to such a state of things. At the present moment there is nothing in the Federal Constitution or in many of the State constitutions which forbids the establishment of a State Church. In many of the States, too, the adherents of one given faith are so far in the ascendant that they could, if they desired, secure the passage of an amendment such as would recognize their form of Christianity as the constitutional one.

There is no way in which this question of religion in the constitutions, State or national, can be safely treated except on the basis of exclusion. The attitude of the Federal Constitution is purely negative in that regard: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion." That is all. Religion has nothing to do with the Constitution or with Congress, and Congress or the Constitution should have nothing to do with religion. That is the principle, and the only principle, on which the American people should treat any proposal to unite religious and secular affairs in the conduct of government.—*St. Paul Dispatch*.
