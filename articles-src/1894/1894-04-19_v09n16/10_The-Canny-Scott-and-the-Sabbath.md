On one occasion Robert Chambers thus reproved a friend for saying the Sabbatarian narrowness of Edinburgh people would render life in Edinburgh intolerable to him.

"That's a good one of the south-country prejudices, and nothing more. There's no sic tyranny and intolerance in Edinbro as y' imagine. If you will only have a prudent care for local sensibility and forbear to fly in the face of your neighbors' opinions, you may amuse yourself in Edinbro very much as you do in London on Sunday. In Edinbro I dine and sup with my friends on the Sabbath just as I do in London. Of course, when I drive out to dine with a friend on Sunday in Edinbro, I don't get into the carriage at my ain door, but round the corner near by, where I have ordered it to be waiting for me. An, of course, I seize the occasion for slipping into it when no folk are watching me. You're quite wrong in fancying the Sabbatarian sentiment in Edinbro is so tyrannical as to prevent you from enjoying yourself on the Laird's day."

"Anyhow—queried his friend—by your own confession, it is so intolerant and tyrannical that you dare not get into a fly at your own door, or even in any street of the neighborhood on a Sunday, when people are looking at you. If that isn't social tyranny, what the deuce is social tyranny?"

"Ay, that's a southron's pugnacious way of looking at the question," replied Mr. Chambers, with a merry twinkle in his eye. "If y'd been reared in Edinbro in the right way in your youth, you would not speak so bitterly of the wholesome moral influence o' your neighbors."—*Free Sunday Advocate*, London.

The foregoing is not an inappropriate commentary upon the system which proposes to secure "Sabbath-keeping" by civil law. If conscience toward God be lacking such conscience as would secure full obedience without civil law, the general result is to secure hypocrisy, as is the case noted above. Genuine obedience in religious matters is never promoted by civil law alone.—*Evangelical and Sabbath Outlook*.
