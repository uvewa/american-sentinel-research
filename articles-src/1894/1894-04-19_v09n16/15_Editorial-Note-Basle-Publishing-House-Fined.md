THE manager of the publishing house of the Seventh-day Adventists at Basle, Switzerland, has been again called before the authorities for Sunday work, and fined. The case will be appealed. There is now more than three hundred francs in fines and costs against the publishing house, for which the manager is responsible. As the fine will not be paid, this means imprisonment,—at the rate of five francs a day,—for over sixty days. But how will it end? The publishing house will not yield the principle. Will the authorities recede from their position?
