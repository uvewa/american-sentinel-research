ALTHOUGH much has been said and written upon this subject, yet there is one feature to which, as it seems to the writer, but little, if any, more than simple reference has been made. That is the realm and province of religion and worship in its priority of existence. It is evident that both civil government and religion were ordained of God. Civil government was not needed and was not called out until after the fall of man. If man had remained loyal to his Maker, had not sinned, and thereby became a selfish being, there would have been no necessity for civil government. But because of sin, in yielding to the temptation to gratify self, man became so supremely selfish as to be altogether unable to conduct himself in a becoming manner, not manifesting even due civility toward others, unless aided by the power of God, or restrained by some organization of society. This organization is called civil government. And the necessities of man's condition as a fallen creature called it into existence.

Not so with religion or worship. Of course, religion, in the common acceptance of the word, is any system of faith and worship. But primarily, the word is used to refer to the performance of those duties that man owes to his Creator, and forms a principle of obedience to the divine will. And worship is to adore and reverence with supreme respect and veneration; to perform acts of adoration; to perform religious service. It needs no argument to prove that all this was in existence before the fall of man; indeed, before his creation even, dating even back to the beginning of the life of the first created being. If the angels were the first created beings, religion and worship dates back to the beginning of their history.

As the sequel has proved, all these were created with the power of choice, to worship or not to worship; to obey or not to obey. Among the angels there could be no such thing as a civil government, notwithstanding some of them sinned and fell; because that was a theocracy pure and simple. That is purely a government of God, where the unfallen angels render willing obedience and the disloyal were cast out. And among the countless thousands of worlds there was but one world where the inhabitants refused to render willing obedience to that God who made them all; and consequently but one world where there is any need of civil governments of any form whatever. In those worlds religion pure and simple may be found, and religious observances and supreme worship carried on without the aid or restraint of civil government; and it is but reasonable to conclude that in those worlds religion and worship is to be found in its perfection, as is only possible when created beings have not made themselves supremely selfish by disobedience, and this is according to God's design.

Thus it becomes evident that religion does flourish best where it is in no way connected with the State. It is also just as evident that religion has a different realm from that of the State. It is also evident that in this world it was the purpose of God that religion and worship should have been found in just as pure and simple and perfect a condition as in any of the worlds or in heaven itself. It is further evident that this purpose of God will yet be accomplished in this world till there shall not be one blot in all the universe of God. As this work or purpose was not accomplished in the first Adam, it will be accomplished in the second Adam.

But to whom was this work committed, to the Church or to the State? And how or by what power? Will it be by that of the State or by the power of God? Evidently, by the same power that began the work, and that is the creative power of God. Man was created in the image of God and made the ruler of the world. But man fell, and became, instead of a ruler, the abject slave to his own supreme selfishness; and nothing but the same power that created can redeem him again from that bondage. This was offered through Jesus Christ, and began its work before civil government was organized. It has been carried on through Jesus Christ in all the ages of the world, and to gather out a people who would accept of that power of God, and that power of God is in the gospel of Jesus Christ; for it "is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth." And every one who will take hold of that power by faith in Jesus Christ may and will be saved from the power of his own supreme selfishness; and all who, from Adam down to the present time, have availed themselves of this power of God, have been lost to self to that extent that they could and did recognize and respect the inalienable rights of all men. They have not needed the power of the State to aid or to compel them to be civil towards others. Indeed, these have only been as "strangers," and in a strange country, seeking a heavenly country where all men would be civil respecting the rights of all. And as this work was begun and offered to Adam even before his expulsion from Eden, even so God gave this work into the hands of those who would believe, to his church composed of believers, and this work of the church begun by Adam, to carry forward to the end of time. And all who have believed, and all who will believe, have ever depended and will depend upon the power of God and not upon the power of the State for salvation.

But all men have not believed to lay hold upon that power; and always there have been some who have so far refused to yield themselves to the influence of that power, that their own supreme selfishness has led them to overt actions, trespassing, infringing, invading and even subverting the rights of others to their own selfish purposes. Now, as the power of God, as revealed in the gospel of Jesus Christ, could not be the power of God if it should constrain by force, for it is the power of love, there must be some other power brought to bear upon all who will not voluntarily accept of and lay hold upon the power of God to save themselves from the power of their own selfish hearts. Here was the necessity of civil government, and here is its province. For this purpose it was ordained. The Church was ordained to do the work that pertains to the realm of religion and all those things that pertain to a future life, but never the work of the State; while the State is ordained with reference to the things of this life, with no reference to, or connection with, the work of the Church, each in its own realm carrying forward each its own work.
