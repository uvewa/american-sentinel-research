The New York Sun, of April 9, under the title "Don't Confuse this with the A. P. A.," has this notice of the National League for the Protection of American Institutions:—

Active work has already been begun by the "National League for the Protection of American Institutions," in preparation for the coming Constitutional Convention, to meet in May next. The especial object toward which the efforts of the league will be directed will be that of urging upon the voters of the State the necessity for the adoption of the following amendment to Article VIII. of the Constitution as now in force:—

Sec. 12. No law shall be passed respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, nor shall the State, or any county, city, town, village, or other civil division, use its property or credit, or any money raised by taxation or otherwise, or authorize either to be used, for the purpose of founding, maintaining, or aiding, by appropriation, payment for services, expenses, or in any other manner, any church, religious denomination, or religious society, or any institution, society, or undertaking which is wholly or in part under sectarian or ecclesiastical control.

The amendment has been prepared by the Law Committee of the league, consisting of William Allen Butler, Dorman B. Eaton, Wheeler H. Peckham, Henry E. Howland, and Cephas Brainerd.

An address to the citizens of the State has just been issued by the league, explanatory of the amendment for which the votes of the people will be asked, which says, in part:—

New York State, more than others, has suffered from politico-religious alliances based upon enormous sectarian appropriations to institutions and undertakings under sectarian control. These have introduced religious questions into politics, have debased both religious and civil life, have encouraged a scramble for spoils, and have discouraged effort for the public welfare. The proposed amendment deals impartially with all religious usages and creeds, protects the common school fund, and secures that money drawn from the people by taxation shall honestly be used only for those civil purposes for which it was collected.

We believe that the proposed amendment, when incorporated in the organic law of the State, will produce the following results:—

1. Preserves the integrity of the funds and the fair and impartial character of the American free public school system.
2. Eliminates religious controversy from political questions of the peace.
3. Secures and perpetuates essential separation of Church and State.
4. Destroys the intimidating power of ecclesiasticism over both citizens and lawmakers.

Failure to pass this amendment to our organic law at the present time would result in:—

1. Increased and continually increasing arrogance on the part of those who seek ecclesiastical or sectarian advantages by political organization, and by the use of public money.
2. The continued disturbance of civil peace, of political peace, and of legislative and executive action by insatiate demands of public money for private ends.
3. The continued effort to decide questions of religious faith by political authorities.
4. Continually increasing burdens laid upon the State for the support of private ecclesiastical or sectarian institutions.
5. The gradual dismemberment and destruction of our free common school system.
6. The indirect but dangerous union of Church and State in matters pertaining to taxation.

This proposed amendment to the constitution of the State of New York is in similar terms to the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States which the national league has already presented before the Judiciary Committee of Congress. The effort of this league is concentrated upon the public funds; although the language of its amendment is general and sweeping, really the entire purpose of the organization is to secure the public funds from "sectarian" use,—and that because of the fact that the Roman Catholic institutions have succeeded in obtaining the lion's share of the religious appropriations from the State of New York and from Congress.

This league has been confused with the A. P. A., much to its chagrin,—and it is not at all surprising that it should have been, for the main difference between the two, is that while the A. P. A. is confessedly a secret organization, this league is professedly non-secret; but the purposes of the two orders are really identical, although not co-extensive. The one is directed against Roman Catholicism and Roman Catholics in every walk of life, social, business, and political, while the other confines itself to the school question and the appropriation of public moneys, and constitutes itself a special guardian of those public interests against Roman Catholic encroachment. But the National League for the Protection of American Institutions has no thought of protecting American institutions from the encroachments of so-called Protestants,—quite the contrary, its desire to protect them from becoming Roman Catholic spoil is merely that they may be reserved wholly for the use and occupation of an apostate Protestantism.

This league either knowingly and intentionally stultifies itself with the deliberate intent of failing to live up to the full meaning of the terms of its amendment, or else it is ignorant of the full scope of their significance.
