AN EFFECTIVE SENTENCE FROM THE PEN OF Professor George D. Herron, Iowa College, is this:—

The social revolution, making the closing years of our century and the dawning years of the next the most crucial and formative since the crucifixion of the Son of man, is the call and opportunity of Christendom to become Christian.

This is striking language, but it is even more impressive truth. The evidences that this country is entering upon an era of social tumult and struggle are unmistakable. However Falstaffian an array the "Army of the Commonwealth" may appear to be,—it is the vanguard of the unknown column marching out of the mists of the coming years, and, as the herald of the era which it ushers in, is worthy of sober consideration rather than jeers. Coxey's army and the Tillman war are precursors of social tornadoes to come which will disturb the civic peace as the atmospheric calm of the western prairies is broken now already by the whirling blast of the dreaded cyclone. These things are the cry marking the approach of the darkest hour before the dawn, and the final opportunity.
