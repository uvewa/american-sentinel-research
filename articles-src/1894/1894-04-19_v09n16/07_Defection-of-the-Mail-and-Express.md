The Mail and Express, of Monday, April 9, in the course of an editorial article on the subject of prohibition, expresses itself thus upon the question of attempted enforcement of morality:—

We repeat our proposition that coercion is a failure in regulating human conduct. You cannot prevent vice or produce virtue by force. Indeed, there is no virtue in a forced act. People cannot be legislated into morality. Virtue is voluntary and must come from within. Laws are for the regulation of external acts, and while they may to some extent restrain human conduct, they must forever fail in forming and controlling human character.

Out of the heart proceeds the issues of life. As a man "thinketh in his heart so is he." Moral precepts are addressed to the heart, the seat of the moral nature of man. Character is determined by the kind of principles adopted for the regulation of conduct. Character is the pivot upon which conduct turns. Law properly framed may measurably regulate conduct, but it can never reform, much less transform, character. True reformation must come from within, through the influence of Christian motives. Divine law controls the heart-issues by changing the heart.

Human law seeks to restrain conduct by the deterring influence of fear. Divine law is the eternal standard of moral principles as well as the gauge of human conduct, and therefore must stand, whether obeyed or violated. Human law is simply an expedient for the restraint and regulation of conduct, and if inoperative and unsuccessful, has no reason for its existence.

The Mail and Express has always been an outspoken National Reform and Sabbath Union organ. From the standpoint of these organizations, such views as the Mail and Express has here adopted, are rank heresy.

These views, however, are just and right and truthful,—let the Mail and Express hereafter consistently cling to them.
