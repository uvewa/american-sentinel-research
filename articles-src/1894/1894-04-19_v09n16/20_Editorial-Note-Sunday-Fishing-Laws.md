THE *Brooklyn Daily Eagle* has this item:—

In most of the States of the Union Sunday fishing is prohibited, and in this State the legislature recently refused to pass a bill which made it legal. On general principles it may be said that any law which prohibits such a harmless and innocent amusement as fishing on Sunday is a relic of bigotry. The notion that it is the province of the State to enforce Sabbath observance in such an extreme direction was exploded long ago. It is very certain that the existing law will not be heeded by any true fisherman, even though Sunday fishing be proverbially unlucky.

The *Eagle* seems to think that Sunday fishing is such a little sin that it don't count. But what is the difference in principle between laws prohibiting fishing on Sunday, solely because it is Sunday, and laws prohibiting any other amusement or labor on Sunday for the same reason.
