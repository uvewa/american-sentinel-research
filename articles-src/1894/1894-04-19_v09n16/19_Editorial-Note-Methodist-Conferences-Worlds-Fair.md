THE METHODIST CONFERENCES have not even yet ceased passing resolutions in regard to the Sunday closing of the World's Fair. The *New York Sun*, of April 10, has this paragraph in a report of proceedings:—

The World's Fair furnished a theme for discussion to the New York Methodist Conference yesterday. The Committee on Sabbath Observance presented through its chairman, the Rev. A. H. Ames, a report that the Sunday closing of the Fair at Chicago proved that Sunday was still regarded as sacred to the people of the country. This didn't meet with the approval of Dr. McAnnay of Tarrytown, who arose, and, speaking with some heat, said: "We take it for granted that the Fair was closed on Sunday because of reverence on the part of the management for the sanctity of the day. It wasn't. It was because it wouldn't pay to keep open on Sunday. I protest against such a report." Some one moved that the passage about the World's Fair be stricken out, but the motion had no second and the report was adopted.

The Methodists seem to have come to a point where they believe most implicitly in the infallibility and omnipotence of a set of resolutions. The heretics who have any doubt as to the efficacy of their campaigning influence are very quickly relegated to the scoffers' corner.
