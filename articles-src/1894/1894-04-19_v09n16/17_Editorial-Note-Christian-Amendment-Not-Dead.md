ALTHOUGH the so-called "Christian amendment" to the Constitution of the United States is defeated in the judiciary committees, yet it is laid on the table only for this session of Congress, and will certainly be revived again. It is therefore by no means a dead issue. Indeed, now is the time when it should receive thorough consideration, and the fatal governmental and religious error upon which it is based be fully shown. Its advocates are completely given over to their idols. Through the *Christian Statesman*, they say, "One defeat or a hundred defeats, cannot arrest a movement so instinct with the truth of God, and so vital to the welfare of this great Christian people." The *Statesman* continues as to the principles which animate them, "In the profound conviction that they are right, and must prevail, its advocates will continue to press them upon the attention and consciences of the citizens of the nation." And so they will, by every power that can be brought to bear, moral, social, political, legal, legislative. Oh, no! this measure is not dead; do not make that mistake.
