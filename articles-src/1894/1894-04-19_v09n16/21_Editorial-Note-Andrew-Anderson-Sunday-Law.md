THE *Christian Advocate*, of April 5, has this paragraph:—

The *Presbyterian* tells how one man stopped Sabbath work in the Reading shops at Williamsport, Pa. He declined to work on the Sabbath, and was discharged as a man who had too many scruples for a railroad worker. He quietly informed the men who were in the shops that if they went to work he would prosecute them for violation of the Sunday law of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Seventy-five of the men declined to work the next Lord's day. The name of the sturdy upholder of the civil law was Andrew Anderson.

In thus sturdily upholding the "civil law," did Andrew Anderson show himself to be a "sturdy upholder" of the Golden Rule? In this act did he show that he loved his neighbor as himself? Was this a Christian deed? Did Andrew Anderson thus prove himself to be a Christian?
