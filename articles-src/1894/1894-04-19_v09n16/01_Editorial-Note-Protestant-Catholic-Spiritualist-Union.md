PROFESSSED Protestantism and Roman Catholicism have already clasped hands; their present apparent antagonism is only superficial; it is the effervescence of individual particles which marks a chemical union. The principles of the two religious systems are fast becoming identical.

As Roman Catholicism and professed Protestantism assimilate, their union with Spiritualism will become more and more apparent; but, through its defense of the unscriptural theory of natural immortality, Protestantism will be led first to join itself with the higher forms of Spiritualistic doctrine,—then, when the three, Catholicism, false Protestantism, and Spiritualism, are in full sympathy and union, the rights of conscience will be totally ignored and this country be ripe for the great delusion which prophecy foretells.
