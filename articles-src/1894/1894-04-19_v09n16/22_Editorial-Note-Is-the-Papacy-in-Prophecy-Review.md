"Is the Papacy in Prophecy?" is a most interesting and timely question, and it is aptly answered by Rev. Thomas Haskins, A. M., Rector of Christ Church, Los Angeles, Cal., in a pamphlet bearing that title. This work is the outgrowth of a series of papers read by Mr. Haskins before the Ministerial Union of Los Angeles, and subsequently published by him at the request of the union. That the papacy is in prophecy is clearly shown and its course traced to its final destruction. Mr. Haskins' little work is well worth reading. One hundred pages; size of page, 6 x 9 inches; price, in paper covers, 25 cents; in boards, cloth covered, 50 cents. Address, the author, Los Angeles, Cal., or Pacific Press, 43 Bond Street, New York City.
