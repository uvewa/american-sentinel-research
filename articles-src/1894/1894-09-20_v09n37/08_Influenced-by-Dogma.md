MAYOR SCHIEREN, of Brooklyn, has refused a permit to the German societies of that city to parade on Sunday, October 21, on the occasion of the laying of the corner stone of the new German hospital. The mayor says:—

Neither Germans, Irish, nor Bohemians should ask for special privileges. I am not the mayor of the Germans alone. I believe in churches and am a churchman. I cannot license something that the law prohibits.

The law to which the mayor refers is Section 276 of the Penal Code of New York, which is as follows:—

Sec. 276. All processions and parades on Sunday in any city, excepting only funeral processions for the actual burial of the dead, and processions to and from a place of worship in connection with a religious service there celebrated, are forbidden; and in such excepted cases there shall be no music, fireworks, discharge of canon or firearms, or other disturbing noise. At a military funeral, and at the burial of a national gentleman, or of a deceased member of an association of veteran soldiers, or of a disbanded militia regiment, music may be played while escorting the body, but not within one block of a place of worship where service is then celebrated. A person willfully violating any provisions of this section is punishable by a fine not exceeding $20, or imprisonment not exceeding ten days, or both.

The mayor certainly has the law on his side; but why should he lug in the fact that he believes in churches, etc.? If he is influenced in his action by his loyalty to the law and his determination to administer it impartially, why introduce his views on religion? Is it after all not apparent that Mr. Schieren is influenced in this matter more by his regard for Sunday than by fidelity to civil law?
