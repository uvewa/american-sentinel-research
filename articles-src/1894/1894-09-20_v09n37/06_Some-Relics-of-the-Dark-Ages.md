BAPTISTS have so long enjoyed complete religious liberty in this country that they need to be reminded, now and then, of the restrictions under which their brethren still suffer in other lands. It is true that there are now few countries where men and women, acknowledged to be good citizens, are ever fined and imprisoned for the sole offense of being Baptists, and there is no country where they are put to death for that offense. Persecution has lost some of its rigors, but it still continues. Nor is it confined to a country like Russia, where the absolutism of rule on the one hand, and the ignorance of the people on the other, constitute so exceptional a political and social order.

Take Germany, for example. The Baptist Church in Dresden lately petitioned for freedom to worship God, and this is the decision of the court of appeals of Saxony: "The Baptist congregation in Dresden has no recognition from the State, as a religious congregation; it is not a society, for its constitution and rules have not been recognized; it has no legal existence; it is neither an association nor a fellowship; but only a gathering of persons whose acts are null and void in the eyes of the State." As an unauthorized gathering, the Baptist congregation is completely under the regulation of the police, and must comply with such rules as the police see fit to decree. These are, that they can meet only in the homes of members, a special police license being given for the purpose, distinctly specifying the rooms. Nobody but a Baptist can be pressed. No Sunday-school is permitted. The pastor is not recognized as such, and cannot conduct a funeral service, either in the house or at the grave. Of course, he cannot perform a lawful marriage ceremony. Moreover, even these privileges are enjoyed only at the pleasure of the police, and are liable to be revoked at any time.

Take Austria as another example. A Baptist from this country, temporarily residing in Vienna, was not so greatly surprised to find substantially the same condition of things prevailing there; but she was surprised to find that she herself attended the worship of a Baptist Church at peril of arrest as a disorderly person, unless she obtained a license from the police graciously permitting her attendance. Still more surprising was the discovery that no Baptist could take his own children to any Baptist meeting, until they were fifteen years of age. Whatever religious instruction such children receive before that age must be given them by their parents in the privacy of home. That is perhaps not a bad thing, from one point of view, yet the forbidding of public worship and instruction to children is an intolerable outrage, as well as one of the pettiest, meanest forms of persecution on record.

It is astonishing that priest-ridden Spain should be in advance of Protestant Germany in this matter, though still far from giving religious liberty to Baptists. They are now permitted to have meeting places, though no outward semblance of churches may be given to them. Few or no restrictions are placed upon attendance at these Baptist chapels. But Baptists are still required to be very quiet and discreet in the use of this moderate measure of liberty, and to abstain from everything in the nature of public demonstration. Of course, a Baptist pastor has no legal recognition, nor has a Baptist church; it is merely the tolerated assemblage of people for a religious purpose.

In Italy about the same liberty exists as in Spain. Norway and Sweden and Denmark, until recently, were more rigorous than Germany. Wherever the Lutheran Church is established by law it seems in bigotry and intolerance to exceed the Roman Catholic Church, and to treat Baptists and other Protestant dissenters with a rigor for which not even a belief in its own infallibility and the wickedness of heresy can be pleaded in justification. If its premises were true, the Roman Catholic Church would do right to persecute, but Lutherans do wrong on their own theory.

There is still need that Baptists witness for the truth they have maintained so stoutly and so long, the truth of soul liberty—that no man has a right to meddle with another man's conscience, or to exercise any compulsion or restraint of another man in matters of religion.—The Examiner.
