HIS EMINENCE CARDINAL RAMPOLLA, Secretary of State to Leo XIII., writing in the name of his holiness to the Abbé Six, director of the Democratic Chretienne of Lille, gives stimulating advice to Catholics, both lay and clerical, as to the importance of taking an active part in the work of social organization. Priests as well as the members of their flock should, he says, engage actively and earnestly in this work so that it may be extended and its beneficial effects felt by the people in all directions. . . . As a matter of fact the church has at all times adapted itself to the special characteristics of the age. Just as each period has its particular currents of thought, its problems demanding solution, and its distinct phases of energy, so the church has specific resources for the wants and requirements of the times. It has always been its policy to secure the happiness of the greatest number. . . . Leo XIII., when he ascended the papal throne, perceived that a new era was dawning for humanity, and that the highest service he could render to peoples and nations was to aid them in selecting the path of true progress. Hence we see that he has again and again urged the faithful to take a leading share in directing the movements by which men are struggling for the regeneration of society. . . .

As if by preference, Leo XIII. has himself manifested a particular interest in those countries where the masses have the most direct voice in administration and government. Everybody is aware how strong the monarchical sentiment was among French Catholics some few years ago. . . . But the supreme pontiff recognized that a republican form of government was well suited to the democratic spirit of the French people, and that the majority of them were desirous of maintaining it. He, therefore, cast the weight of his influence in its favor.

Recent events have shown that he has secured for France that stability which is essential to national progress, and that he opened up the way for a new spirit of conciliation between Catholics and the leaders in political life. For that other great democratic country, the United States, his sympathy has not been less marked. On various occasions he has given expression to his admiration for the free development of its institutions, for its advancement in material prosperity, and for the activity its hierarchy display in popular movements. The policy of trust in the people, which finds such earnest and eloquent exponents in the persons of prominent ecclesiastics such as Cardinal Gibbons and Archbishop Ireland, may be said to be a direct emanation from his own lucid encyclicals. We perceive, too, from the letter to the bishops of Brazil—a translation of which we gave in our last issue—how keen is the interest his holiness takes in that trouble. He urges the Catholic clergy and laity to do all that is possible to provide that public representative positions shall be filled by men of integrity, and thus to ensure for the State that wise guidance which is peculiarly essential to it under existing conditions. On the continent of Europe likewise Leo XIII. has given to the social zeal of Catholics an impetus the fruit of which is to be seen in many lands. In France the Catholic workmen's clubs and other labor organizations which afford bright promise for the future of French Catholicism find their most earnest patron in his holiness, and only about a month since, in granting an audience to M. Harmel, who is so well known for his successful attempts to improve the lot of the toilers, he spoke with enthusiasm of the good which results from sustained action of this kind. His holiness furthermore gives the most cordial encouragement to Catholic congresses of all kinds, and the benefits, which may in recent years be traced to the resolutions adopted at such gatherings in Germany, Spain, Italy and other countries, may in no small measure he attributed to his initiative and approval.

There can, then, be no doubt that the Catholic social action of which the holy father is so earnest and powerful a promoter is a remedy both for the religious indifference and political and economic errors of the age. Its object is the welfare of the people without distinction, and it is a safeguard to States because it is corrective both of the selfishness of the wealthy and the chimerical projects into which poor and suffering men are sometimes drawn. These are the two great dangers of the day. On the one hand the self-love of the rich induces them to accumulate money, to enjoy luxuries, and to disregard the hard fate of those to whom fortune is unkind. On the other hand misery amongst the working classes begets temptations to enter on the wild schemes put forward by socialists and anarchists. It is the duty of Catholics to endeavor to bridge over the chasm between the two classes, and this they can do effectively by devoting themselves to that energetic social action so frequently recommended by the head of the church.—Catholic Times, Liverpool, Eng.
