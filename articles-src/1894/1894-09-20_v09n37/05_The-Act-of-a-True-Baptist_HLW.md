[The following note is from the pen of H. L. Wayland, D.D., a Baptist minister of Philadelphia, and appeared in the Baptist Examiner, of this city, Sept. 8th.]

I WROTE to Mr. W. B. Capps, who is confined in the county jail of Weakley County, Tenn., for laboring on Sunday, after having, according to his convictions, observed Saturday as the day of rest and worship, and have received the following from Mr. Capps, who seems a very sincere, unaffected, simple-minded Christian:

Your kind and encouraging letter was received today; yes, my brother, it is true, I am deprived of my liberty for practising my honest convictions; but I am enjoying good health, and am of good courage in the Lord. I am glad we have such a good Saviour, that in trials and persecutions he is with us, and strengthens us to bear these things; if it was not for the hope I have, I could not bear being separated from my dear companion and babies as I am, and in the condition they are. It is true, the Lord will provide for their needs; but you know, my brother, we all had rather be with our family, or be in such a condition that we could go to see them, when we would like to, or when anything happened to them. In this place, it would be with the sheriff whether we could get to go if some of our dear ones were called off. I praise and thank the Lord that I am counted worthy to suffer shame for his name; if it is the Lord's will for me to be imprisoned, it is my will; I can only say, thy will be done. I heard from my wife and babies Monday; they are getting along very well. About the help you spoke of, you can send it to me by money order or registered letter. I will get it all right. Money order will be best, I guess. I appreciate your kindness in helping us in our suffering. Any words of encouragement you can write will be received with Christian love and respect.

Yours in bonds for Christ's sake,

W. B. CAPPS.

I have sent him $5 through the International Religious Liberty Association, Battle Creek.
