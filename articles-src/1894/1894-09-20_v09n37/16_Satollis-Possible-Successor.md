St. Louis, Sept. 12.—In a private letter from Rome to a prominent ecclesiastic of this city, the statement is made on apparently good authority, that if Mgr. Satolli, who has been called to the Vatican, is made a cardinal, he will be succeeded as papal ablegate for the United States by Mgr. Tommasi, at present sub-secretary of State at Rome. Mgr. Tommasi was formerly delegate to Germany, and is 53 years old.—New York Sun, Sept. 13.
