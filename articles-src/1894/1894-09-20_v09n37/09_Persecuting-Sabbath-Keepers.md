The Examiner, July 12th, speaking through Dr. Wayland, late editor of the National Baptist, utters the following genuinely "Baptist doctrine." We are waiting to hear the chorus of Baptist voices lifted in defense of that sort of religious liberty, which means something on questions like that considered in the following:—

"I apprehend that all of the Pennsylvania readers of the Examiner will echo the sentiments expressed in the article headed, 'Shame on Maryland,' for her violation of religious liberty in punishing an unoffending farmer who observed the seventh day, for husking corn on Sunday, while allowing thousands of saloons and brothels and gambling houses to be open every Sunday. We in Philadelphia may have our faults—I neither affirm nor deny—but we do believe in religious liberty; and we do not believe in Church and State. The other day a highly respected and very Reformed and United Presbyterian brother brought to the conference a petition in favor of the Christian amendment to the Constitution. As a matter of courtesy, he was allowed to read his petition, and to lay it on the table for signatures. But, if I were to say that his appeal provoked a bewildering amount of enthusiasm, I might lay myself open to the charge of exaggeration. As he was leaving the room after the adjournment he inquired of a brother, 'Is this such a reception as this cause may expect in the Baptist meetings?' And the reply was, 'Just about.'"—Evangel and Sabbath Outlook.
