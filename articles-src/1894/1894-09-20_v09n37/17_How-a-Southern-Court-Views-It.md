The supreme court of Alabama has decided that the soul is not a legal entity. A resident of Mobile bequeathed $2,000 to be used to obtain causes for the repose of his soul. The heirs objected. The court decreed that the bequest was void because there was no living beneficiary of the trust to execute it and enforce the performance of it, and the soul of the departed was not an entity in the contemplation of the law. Moral: Either give while you live or in your will mention some priest or bishop to take charge of the bequest and see that the masses are said.—Pittsburg Catholic, Aug. 30, 1894.
