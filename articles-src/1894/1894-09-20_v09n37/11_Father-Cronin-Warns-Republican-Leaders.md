BUFFALO, Sept. 6.—The Catholic Union and Times in its issue of to-day contains an open letter from the Rev. Patrick Cronin addressed to the leaders of the Republican party in Buffalo and in the State of New York on the subject of the A. P. A. Father Cronin warns the Republican leaders that disaster threatens the party if it continues to foster members of the A. P. A. organization, who, like devil fish, the writer declares, have fastened their deadly clutch upon the party. He charges that not only have the leaders and the party failed to denounce the schemes of this organization, which has declared war against the fundamental principle of the American Constitution, but have in a complicated manner coquetted with it, and asks how long self-respecting Catholics will tolerate this thing.

In closing he expresses the belief, and emphasizes the hope, that unless something be done—and done quickly—by the Republican leaders to guarantee Catholics against a continuance of the insults, injustice, and wrong instigated by intolerable bigots, it will be the duty of every Catholic in Buffalo—American, Pole, German, Irish, and Italian—and all through the State and nation, to labor and unite to effect Republican defeat.—Sun of Sept. 7, 1894.
