In the government of Kursk a peasant lately presented a petition to the Holy Orthodox Consistory asking the reverend and right reverend members of that august body to use their influence to prevent his being flogged on a Sunday. The memorial set forth that he had been arrested a fortnight before and flogged for no reason whatever. On inquiring why he had been so badly treated he was informed that the punishment had been inflicted by mistake, but that the "right fellow" would now get it "all the hotter."

He then complained to the authorities and was flogged again for daring to do so, and once more on a Sunday. He would now humbly request the consistory to take measures to prevent flogging on Sundays, "inasmuch as our holy religion prohibits work on the Lord's day." The reply of the consistory has not yet transpired. "Some griefs are med'cinable," but it is a somewhat difficult task to find an appropriate remedy for a man who has been first flogged by mistake, then flogged for objecting to it, and each time on a Sunday, when he ought to have been attired in his best clothes, escorting wife and children to church.—Mail and Express, Sept. 8.
