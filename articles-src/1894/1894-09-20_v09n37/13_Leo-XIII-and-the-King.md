Rome, Sept. 11.—In addition to what has already been reported, Premier Crispi, in his speech at Naples, yesterday, said:—

"Society is passing at the present moment through a grievous crisis. Never more than to-day did we feel the want of seeing the two authorities, civil and religious, marching with one accord to lead the people in the way of justice and charity. From the darkest abysses have arisen an infamous sect which writes on its flag, 'No God, no master.' United to-day in common recognition of a memorable period, let us form in closely serried ranks to combat this monster, inscribing upon our flag the motto, 'Our God, our King, and our country.' Yes, let us raise aloft our flag adorned with this sacred device, displaying it to the people as a sign of salvation, 'In hoc signo vences.'"

London, Sept. 11.—Under the caption, "Pons Pontificis," the Poll Mall Gazette prints an article with the object of showing that Premier Crispi is rapidly approaching a reconciliation between the king and the pope. On last Thursday, the article says, Signor Crispi's private secretary had a long interview with Cardinal Rampolla, the former being the first Italian official who has visited the Vatican since 1870. This visit, the Gazette asserts, began a series of negotiations, the result of which are shown in the pope's prompt establishment of an apostolic prefecture in Massowah, immediately following which King Humbert gave his assent to the appointment of Cardinal Sarto, the pope's nominee, to the office of Patriarch of Venice, concerning which appointment there has been a prolonged disagreement between the Vatican and the Quirinal.

The most significant incident of all, however, is the act of Signor Crispi going out of his way in his speech at Naples yesterday, to compliment Cardinal Sanfelice, the Archbishop of Naples, and to summon the Church and the State to join their forces against the common enemy. The presence of Cardinal Sanfelice on the platform, says the Gazette, betokened the willingness of the pope to come to terms.—New York Sun, Sept. 12.
