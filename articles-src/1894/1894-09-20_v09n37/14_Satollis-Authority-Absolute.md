Rome, Italy, Sept. 6.—The pope is preparing an encyclical letter to the bishops and people of the United States. It has been under consideration since the visit of Archbishop Ireland. It will announce the absolute supremacy of the apostolic delegate in church matters in the United States, with the simple right of appeal to the pope.

The apostolic delegation will take the place of the propaganda fide in directing religious affairs in the United States. The encyclical will not deal with scholastic questions.—Mail and Express, Sept. 6, 1894.
