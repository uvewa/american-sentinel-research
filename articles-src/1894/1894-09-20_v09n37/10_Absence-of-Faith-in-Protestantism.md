HER Majesty, Queen Victoria, is Head of the Church of England, as by law established. Successor of the amiable Henry VIII. in the temporal order, she is in the spiritual order, as he declared himself and as he was accepted by the trembling clergy and laity of England and by its subservient Parliament, 'Supreme Head on earth of the Church of England.' She is the guardian of faith and the custodian of truth in the realm of England; her oath at her coronation gives her spiritual as well as temporal jurisdiction. This power she may not exercise herself; she may delegate it to the Court of Arches or to Parliament, which created the Church of England, yet she remains, in theory and in logic, by the institution of the royal supremacy and the institution of the church, the supreme judge in matters of faith and morals. She does not exercise that power herself, and curiously enough she is careful not to delegate it to the convocations of the clergy or to the decisions of the bishops and archbishops of England; but she is careful to have her spiritual authority exercised by Parliament, and especially by the courts composed of lay judges, who at any moment may be Presbyterian, Baptists, Catholics or even Jews, and who at the best have never made theological studies, to prepare them to judge questions of faith and morals, of doctrine and discipline, of the rubrics and other matters of purely ecclesiastical import. This is of course an unnatural arrangement and illogical, but everything about the Church of England and indeed about Protestantism, is unnatural. With them all, faith and doctrine vary with the times; what their fathers received as truth, they reject or modify according to the tendency of the opinion, or rather whim of the day. Exactness of doctrine has no meaning in their eyes; truth has no stability; faith, pure faith, the acceptance of revelation, does not exist in their minds; everything is a matter of opinion, and like all opinions subject to change, to be accepted or rejected, in whole or in part, according as the current of popular ideas sways back and forth. In their eyes doctrine is a matter of circumstances and faith is modified thereby.

Queen Victoria is a true specimen of this absence in Protestantism of doctrinal belief and faith. In England she is head of the Church, as by law established, and she attends regularly the Anglican Church. When she goes up to her beloved Scotland she is often a devout attendant at the Presbyterian services, and towards all other sects she shows an interest which would lead one to believe that she considered they all possess the truth. Only towards one church is she inexorable; towards it all sects are also inexorable in their opposition as all errors are opposed to truth. It is the Catholic Church which is thus everywhere and at all times opposed by the sects, all of which, except one at the most, must logically be in error as they all contradict each other in matters of doctrine, as they are all constantly changing in their beliefs.

In another way Queen Victoria affords another instance of the absence of full faith even in sincere Protestants. She is head of the Church of England, the Protestant Episcopal Church; yet her daughters, when they marry out of England, adopt the religion of their husbands. Her eldest daughter, when she became the wife of the Crown Prince, adopted the Lutheran religion, that of her country of adoption, and her children, the present Emperor of Germany and his brother, are Lutherans. Princess Alice, who married the Grand Duke of Hesse, also adopted the forms of the Lutheran Church and her children were baptized into that church. She, herself, however, was of too logical a mind to be satisfied with the variations of Protestantism, and she frankly accepted the theories of free-thought. She read the proofs of the books published by Strauss against Christianity, and scandalized her mother and family, and even her libertine husband, by the audacity and recklessness of her opinions. It was only when the shadow of death came into her family and that her beloved children were in its awful presence, that she turned back to God and sought in prayer the strength and consolation which all her philosophy could never supply.

Her daughter is now engaged to be married, and like her mother, she too has to give up the faith of her childhood and bow before new altars. She has found favor in the eyes of the Czar of Russia, and her hand is to be bestowed on his son, the Czarowitch. She must, according to Russian law, belong to the national church, and therefore she is to embrace the faith of the Greek Church. All this seems quite natural to Protestantism, and yet is it not making a mockery of faith, trifling with the truth, making alliances with error and heresy?—The Monitor, May 26, 1894.
