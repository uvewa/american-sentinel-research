MORE quotations are printed below from the Roman Catholic work, "Manual of Devotion to Good St. Anne." Fearing that the reader may doubt the genuineness of the quotations we repeat that the book contains the indorsement of "E. A. Card. Paschereau, Archbishop of Quebec," and is published by "General Printing Office, A. Côté & Co., Quebec," and can be secured by addressing the publishers. Price 50 cents. The quotations are followed, as in last week's article, by scriptural comments. We have italicized some of the most prominent features in the couplets, but were all the points emphasized the larger portion of the matter would appear in italics.

To our Roman Catholic readers we say that the matter is not published for the purpose of ridiculing Catholics nor Catholic doctrines, but from love for the souls of Roman Catholics for whom Christ died; and with the hope of exalting in their minds the Lord Jesus Christ to the place he occupies by the will and word of God, which place, by the teaching of this book, is given to "St. Anne."

"O Good Jesus, be compassionate to the faithful servants of thy grandmother St. Anne, show then thy mercy, and for love of her extend to them a helping hand in all their necessities. O Mary, Mother of God, vouchsafe always to protect those who pay homage to thy blessed mother and serve her with a devout heart." P. 362.

"Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak to thee. But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?

For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, my sister, and my mother." Matt. 12:47-50

"O wise and potent Mother, who hast so much power and merit before God and who reigned in glory with the Queen of Paradise, thy blessed Daughter Mary, never let thy heart forget my needs. I am indeed thy unworthy servant, but I treasure in my soul the thought that my devotedness to serve thee will be the pledge of my salvation." Pp. 364, 365.

"Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the fruit of her womb? Yea they may forget, yet will I not forget thee. Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands." Isa. 49:15, 16. "Then said Jesus unto him, Get thee behind me Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve." Matt. 4:10.

And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever."
