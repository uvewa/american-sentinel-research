It is probable that Hungary will soon have a civil marriage law. The Liberal Party has been contending for this for a long time, but a slender majority in the House of Magnates has prevented the passage of the act. The emperor has now consented, however, to create enough Liberal magnates to give the Liberals a majority and thus secure the passage of the Civil Marriage act. This will be a victory over Romish tyranny.
