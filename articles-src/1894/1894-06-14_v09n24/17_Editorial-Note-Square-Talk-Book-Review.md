THE SENTINEL has received an unobtrusive little book, bound in linen of a quiet Quaker gray, and with the title written diagonally across the cover in bold plain script—"A Square Talk to Young Men: by H. L. Hastings—Third Million." This little volume contains one hundred and twenty-five pages, and includes not only the able and practical address to young men on the inspiration of the Bible,—which is the subject of the "square talk,"—but also a very thorough discussion of the question, "Are There Corruptions in the New Testament? A Condensed Statement of the Facts Regarding the Preservation and Transmission of the New Testament Writings." It was a happy thought to bind these two companion pieces of earnest exhortation and convincing evidence together in permanent form. The circulation of this book in this form should reach many more millions.

Price 75c. Address, H. L. Hastings, Boston, Mass.
