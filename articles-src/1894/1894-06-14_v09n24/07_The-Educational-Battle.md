## ROME SCORES A POINT.

Under this heading the Catholic Times, of May 4, begins an editorial thus:—

Catholics throughout every part of the country will rejoice that their leaders have at last taken a decisive step in the educational struggle. The bishops at their Low Week meeting drew up a series of resolutions on the subject, which have just been published, and under the presidency of the cardinal-archbishop a committee has been appointed to draft a bill which will in due course be presented to Parliament.

The main points in the resolutions above referred to are these: That Catholic parents cannot accept for their children a system of education in which secular instruction is wholly divorced from education in their religion.

That the only system of religious education which Catholic parents can accept for their children is that given under the authority and direction of the Catholic Church.

That to take the management of schools intended for Catholic children out of the hands of Catholics, and to place it in the hands of public ratepayers, is "a violation of parental rights, to be resisted as an unwarrantable attack upon religious liberty."

"That Catholic public elementary schools, satisfying the demands of the Education Department, have a right to as full a share of public money, whether from the rates or from the taxes, as any other public elementary schools in the country; and that it is unjust to deprive them of it because of the religious instruction required by the parents, which is given to the children attending such schools."

"That, in the present religious condition of England, the State ought to observe a consistent and strict impartiality in respect to religious education, whether given in voluntary or in board schools; and to distribute for 'maintenance,' to all public elementary schools fulfilling the requirements of the Education Department, an equal proportionate share of the public money collected for public elementary education."

"That compulsory State education is an intolerable tyranny, unless due regard be paid by the State to the education of the children in their own religion."

"That Catholics, deeply impressed with all that is involved in the issue of popular education, are now compelled to assert their just claim to a full share of the public money raised for the purposes of elementary education."

This is, in brief, and largely in their own words, the Catholic position. As before stated, the cardinal and his bishops are at work upon a bill to be presented to Parliament at a fit time, which, if passed, will give to the Catholics all that they desire.

The Catholics have chosen their time well. The circular which has been issued, and which has caused so much controversy in the school board, is to the effect that teachers are to give instruction in "the Christian religion." Now the Catholic Church claims to be Christian, and the majority of Protestants allow the claim. Therefore, by the decision of the majority of the school board, the Catholics are justified in their claim for a proportionate share in the public money.

From the point of view that it is the duty of the State to provide religious instruction for the people, the Catholic claim is unanswerable; for it is very evident to all that the State has no right to insist on giving children religious instruction to which their parents object, and if religious instruction is to be given, it must be given by those who profess the religion to be taught. Consistency and common fairness, therefore, demand that all who believe that public schools ought to teach religion, shall acquiesce in the demand made by the Catholics.

Unfortunately all but a very small and insignificant minority are committed to the idea of State instruction in religion. Those who have protested against the School Board circular have had no case, because they continually asserted their belief that religion should be taught in the public schools. Thus their protest against the proposal to make such instruction definite was deprived of all force.

The dignitaries of the Church of England have just placed another weapon in the hands of the Roman Catholics. Until recently King's College, London, has been receiving £1,700 a year from the government. This has now been discontinued on the ground that the college is a religious institution. A meeting was recently held under the presidency of the Archbishop of Canterbury, in which it was voted "that the action of the government in laying down rules for the appointment of the Parliamentary grant to university colleges, by which any college founded on the religious basis of King's College is excluded, is illiberal and oppressive." Lord Salisbury characterized the action as "spontaneous, gratuitous, and arbitrary persecution." King's College is now in exactly the same condition as the Catholic schools; and every statement made concerning it will apply equally to them.

We do not by any means expect that as a general thing either Churchmen or Nonconformists will agree that the Catholics ought to be given a share of the public money, to be used in instructing their children in the Catholic religion. They thought only of themselves when contending for religious instruction to be supported with public money; but now they may see that they were all the time working for the Roman Catholics, who are determined to reap the full benefit. They cannot oppose the Catholic claim without giving up their own claim, and even if they should do that it would not deprive the Catholics of the advantage that they have gained.

Thus Rome steadily moves ahead, assisted by professed Protestants. This is a case that is worth watching. It may be that it will result in bringing many professed Protestants to stand on real Protestant ground, namely, that the State and Christianity have no manner of connection, and that the true Church asks for and accepts no aid from any power except God.—Present Truth, London.
