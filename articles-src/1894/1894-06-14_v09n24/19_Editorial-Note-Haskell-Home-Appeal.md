ONE of the most worthy charities to be found anywhere is the Haskell Home, at Battle Creek, Mich., a home designed primarily for children, but at present accommodating temporarily, also, a few old ladies. The maintenance fund of the home is now very low and contributions are solicited. Will not the readers of the SENTINEL respond to this call? "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me." Send all remittances to J. H. Kellogg, M. D., Battle Creek, Mich.
