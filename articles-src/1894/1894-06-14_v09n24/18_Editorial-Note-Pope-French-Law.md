THE POPE, it is stated, has instructed the French bishops to accept the new law in regard to church buildings, without opposition. At the same time he expresses the opinion that the French bishops ought to approach the government in an identical request that the decree in regard to church buildings be applied with mildness. The new law takes the management of the parochial funds out of the exclusive control of the incumbent. The readiness of the French bishops to accept this new law is accounted for not only by the fact that the pope has "instructed" them to accept it, but by the further fact that stipends from the government depend upon obedience to the law. The government pays the priests a certain sum, and of course claims the right to command them in certain matters.
