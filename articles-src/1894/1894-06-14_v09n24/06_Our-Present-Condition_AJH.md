The man who has been blessed with the ordinary gift of discernment may be startled by halting a short time and taking a view of the situation of things around him. And surely there is sufficient cause for wondering when we realize that in this land of boasted wealth and plenty, the home of the honest workingman, such a state of things exists as is represented, as follows, in the Reading (Pa.) Review, of recent date:

Hard times, hard times, panic, industrial depression, stringency in the money market, mortgage foreclosures, eviction, idleness, bankruptcy, strikes, lockouts, boycotts, riots, want, starvation, crime, anarchy, dynamic bombs, burglary, incendiary, murder, and death from exposure and want of food.

These are words I hear upon the streets, in the mills, stores, private offices, lecture stage, pulpit, press, and in the homes of high and low; from men and women, some with resignation, some with indifference, others with fierce and terrible oaths.

And is it possible that in a land of plenty there is starvation? We know it is. Were there ever more stirring times than at present, especially in times of seeming peace? To this question we can answer, Never!

Honest men are wandering from town to town seeking for something to do; begging for the privilege of earning an honest living. To be sure, there are others who go from place to place who do not care to earn what they get, while the honest are willing to turn their hand to anything to support themselves, and fill the mouths of their hungry wives and children, whom they have left behind. Thousands are in this condition to-day. And this picture is not a dream, but a stern reality.

It is beyond the power of man in a natural condition to solve this problem, to give a reason or an excuse for this great depression. Can we wonder that crime and bloodshed follow such a state of things? The papers record daily many instances of bad conduct caused by men, and even women, who seem to be mad, and many times the cause of the deed is not made known.

On every hand is desolation. The dark clouds of trouble are rising higher and higher. Armies of unemployed men are gathering in different places demanding relief; starvation seems to be staring them in the face. Life must be sustained, and the question is asked, "What does all this mean?"

We can go to only one source for an answer. It does not take a theological student to see in the Word of God a plain prediction of all these things. Hundreds of years ago, the Creator of the universe looked forward and saw the condition of things as they are at present. For we have the word of God, the one who sees the end from the beginning, that near the end of this world's history, just such a state of things would exist. He especially combines with these a falling away of the nominal church of Christ, a letting down of the high standard of the true principles of Christianity.

We read in 2 Peter 1:20, 21: "Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost."

So Daniel, in his prophecy of the last days, says: "And there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book." Dan. 12:1. Therefore Daniel was used by the Spirit of God to communicate the word of God to the world, that men may not be in darkness. Likewise Paul, in 2 Tim. 3:1-5, gives us a description of the condition of the religious world at the time of the end, just before the drama of this world shall close. He says: "This know also in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, . . . traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God, having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof." And this shows the condition of those who try to follow the church and the world at the same time, hoping to escape the trials and perplexities of the world by a mere profession; but we know that profession without possession is pure folly.

We are now entering upon these perilous times. We see on every hand the selfishness of man, especially of those who have wealth. When we look into the vaults of our land and observe the millions of gold and silver stored there by only a few, and know that these few are grasping for more, and see that men will not invest their means, nor venture out, it only gives us another view of what we find recorded in the gospels. In Luke 21:25-27, Christ is speaking of the sign of the end of the world, and of his second coming; he says: "And there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; men's hearts failing them for fear and for looking after the things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken, and then shall they see the Son of man coming." Did we ever see a plainer fulfillment of God's word, "men's hearts failing them for fear"? "Uncertainty," is the cry, "we cannot invest," etc. And now consider the events that Christ said would follow.

Another significant fact pictured out in the Word of God is recorded in James 5:1-7: "Go to now ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. . . . Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, . . . ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. Behold the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth. . . . Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord."

Could words be plainer, could the prophet have pictured a more nearly perfect likeness? The treasures of gold which are heaped together at present, and the millions which are accumulating, will only be a witness against those who are mentioned in this chapter. The nations of the earth are steadily following the lines marked out in the prophetic word, and many millions are ignorant of the fact that they are fulfilling God's word by their course of action to-day.

But where is refuge for the oppressed? In Christ only there is hope, for the prophet says that "at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book." "Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth."

To every soul is given the invitation to flee to Christ, and every one who will take the Word of God and study it, and live by it, and accept Christ as his Saviour will be cared for in the time of perplexity, and when all things close, will be found with his name written in the book of life.
