THE Allied American, of June 2, an A. P. A. organ, published in Cleveland, Ohio, has this editorial note:—

"When any form of religion imperils the safety of the State it should be suppressed."

This is a fit companion piece to the utterance quoted by us in the SENTINEL of May 24, concerning parochial schools. And again our caution of some months ago is justified, namely: "The A. P. A. should see to it that in its efforts to preserve civil and religious liberty, it does not destroy both."

It is exactly on this ground, i. e., public policy, that all religious persecution has been defended. The Jews sought to destroy Christ because they said: "If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans will come and take away both our place and nation." Pagan Rome prosecuted the early Christians because their religion was inimical to the State. Under papal Rome the same plea was urged, namely, political necessity. Political stability was declared to be impossible without Christianity, and the papacy was alone Christian; hence heresy must be exterminated. If the Allied American, the New Era, and the American Standard correctly represent the A. P. A., then that association is less dangerous to liberty than is the papacy only because less powerful. Do these papers speak advisedly? Do they represent the A. P. A.?
