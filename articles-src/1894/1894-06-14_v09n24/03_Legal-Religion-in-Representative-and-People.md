An exchange contains the following paragraph:—

The strong arm of the civil authority was invoked in the cause of the Lord at Maysville, Ky., April 9th. A proclamation was issued by the mayor, requesting that all places of business be closed each day during the holding of revival meetings, from 10 o'clock until noon, and from 7 until 9 in the evening. The Lord's agents must be getting desperate over in Kentucky. When a community is commanded by proclamation of its mayor to drop all business and go to church, it is about time to inquire by what authority the mayor acts, and if there is a law in that State compelling church attendance.

The authorities of Maysville seem to think it necessary to carry the idea of civil interference in religion quite to its limit, in order to uphold the good name of Kentucky in the present crisis of representative immorality under which it is suffering. It should be borne in mind that it was by just such measures as this by which the representative, whose disgrace they deplore, strove to uphold the tottering fabric of his public character. There is always sure to be something wrong at the heart when civil authority is invoked to sustain or "protect," or further, religion. Let the civil authorities of Maysville, and of Kentucky, stop and think before they follow the example of their silver-tongued deceiver whether or no their act does not cause, and strive to cover, the same impurity between Church and State.
