Four hundred thousand dollars is the amount which it is proposed to give to Roman Catholic schools this year from the national treasury. During the past eight years the Roman Catholics have received $2,366,416 from the Government for the support of their schools. During the same period "Protestants" received $1,401,535; it is true these so-called Protestants, seeing that in a game of this kind they were no match for Rome, have refused to accept further appropriations, but the mischief has been done. The precedent has been established and in all probability Rome will get the money as usual; while "Protestants" will have the experience.
