At present the different religious bills before Congress are resting quietly in the several committees to which they have been assigned. The Sunday bill for the District of Columbia has received, in this Congress, more extended notice than when previously introduced, having been referred from the Committee on the District to the district commissioners and by them to the attorney for the District, who reported unfavorably upon it; the bill was returned to the committee with his report, and it is understood will not receive further consideration this session.

The national "Bill for Sunday Rest," introduced by Senator Kyle and referred to the Senate Committee on Education and Labor, is not expected to receive further attention from that committee.

The religious amendment to the Constitution, for the insertion of a religious phrase in the preamble to the Constitution, is not looked upon with favor in the judiciary committees and is not likely to be brought into public notice at present.

As an offset to the different measures for the strict enforcement of Sunday observance in the District of Columbia and elsewhere throughout the jurisdiction of Congress, Mr. Durborow, of Illinois, has introduced in the House a joint resolution requiring the opening to the public of the Smithsonian Institution, the National Museum, the Botanical Gardens, and the Washington Monument on Sunday, as well as for two hours longer during every day, and also for certain evenings during the week. The basis for this is the dissatisfaction long existing and expressed by the many thousands of government employés, who are debarred by the present regulations from any advantage from these institutions.

The measure as introduced on May 28, is as follows:—

Joint resolution to instruct the officers in charge to keep the Smithsonian Institution, the National Museum, the Botanical Gardens, and the Washington Monument open on every week day from nine antemeridian to six postmeridian, and on Sundays from nine antemeridian to four postmeridian, and on not less than three evenings every week from seven to ten o'clock.

Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the officers in charge of the Smithsonian Institution, the National Museum, the Botanical Gardens, and the Washington Monument be, and hereby are, instructed to keep those properties open to the public on every week day from nine antemeridian to six postmeridian, and on Sunday from nine antimeridian to four postmeridian, and on not less than three evenings every week from seven to ten o'clock.

The resolution was referred to the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds. It may be that the result of this will be to stir up again the heat of religious discussion which would seem to have cooled in the presence of the critical, political, economic, and social conditions which confront the country and necessarily force themselves upon the attention of its representatives to the exclusion, at present, of those matters which are derivative and secondary in their character.

The expression of religious delusion which is at the moment most prominent in Washington, as well as elsewhere in various parts of the country, is that strange mixture of politics and reincarnation represented by the Coxey Army movement. Yet, however strange, uncouth and uncanny, this seems it is directly allied with the religious error of the religious bills before Congress and their promoters and supporters. All this is an expression of the same delusion varying in form according to the grade of society and the condition of intellectual development from which it arises.
