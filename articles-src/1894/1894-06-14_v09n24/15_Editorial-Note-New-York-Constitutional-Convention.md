THE Constitutional Convention now in session at Albany has been asked to incorporate into the new constitution this provision:—

No law shall be passed respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, nor shall the State, or any county, city, town, village, or other civil division, use its property or credit, or any money raised by taxation or otherwise, or authorize either to be used for the purpose of founding, maintaining, or aiding, by appropriation, payment for services, expenses, or in any other manner, any church, religious denomination, or religious society, or any institution, society, or undertaking, which is wholly or in part under sectarian or ecclesiastical control.

The proposed section is being opposed by Roman Catholics, who urge that while it would cut off all State aid to their institutions it would still permit appropriations to the various so-called unsectarian institutions; unsectarian as between Protestants, but nevertheless essentially Protestant in their management and teaching. This point is well taken; such is doubtless the purpose of the League for the Protection of American Institutions, which has proposed, and is pushing, the measure. If the proposed section prohibited the use of any public funds, etc., for any church, religious denomination, or religious society, institution, or undertaking whatsoever, and stopped there, no such objection could be made to it; but the words: "Wholly or in part under sectarian or ecclesiastical control," leave an open door for that colorless thing called "unsectarian religious instruction," but which is offensive to Rome because it is a denial of her claim that she alone is the Christian Church. Rome's claims are false, but the State has no right to use public money to expose or undermine them.
