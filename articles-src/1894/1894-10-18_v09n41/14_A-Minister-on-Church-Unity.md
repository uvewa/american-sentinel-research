"Church Unity" was the subject discussed by the Rev. Dr. Charles A. Briggs, of Union Theological Seminary, this city, last Tuesday at the annual meeting of the Connecticut Valley Congregational Club at South Deerfield, Mass. Dr. Briggs, who is a Presbyterian, told his hearers that the Protestant church has been more intolerant than the Catholic Church, and that Catholics were far in advance of Protestants in managing the financial affairs of the church. The doctor also said that the Protestants could well dispense with 50,000 out of their 99,000 clergymen in this country, and $200,000,000, of the $549,000,000 invested in churches.

"Nothing," said he, "is nearer my heart than Christian unity. Not only is the present pope earnestly looking forward to the time when Christian unity may come, but we see in the utterances of cardinals, archbishops, and bishops that the unity of Christendom is weighing on their hearts. There is nothing in the New Testament that prevents all of us from coming together. For some years I have agreed with the authorities of the Catholic Church to a certain extent in the interpretation that they place upon the words, 'Upon this rock will I build my church.' Peter was the first Christian to put in place after Christ. Others follow him. Many of the terms in the Testament are really synonymous. They all teach Christian unity."

We desire to remark to Dr. Briggs that the only way Christian unity can be attained is through the Catholic Church. She is the true, never changing church, and she is always glad to welcome to her fold men from every denomination. Let Dr. Briggs become a Catholic. He will then be showing his followers the way toward Christian unity.—Catholic News, Oct. 3.
