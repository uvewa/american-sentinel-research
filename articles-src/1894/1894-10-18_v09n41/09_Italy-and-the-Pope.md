As was anticipated by this journal would be the case, the overtures, if such they can be called, of Signor Crispi to the Vatican have proved to be shor' lived. A London dispatch put forth with authority states that the doubt which was felt at first regarding the honesty of Premier Crispi's speech at Naples not only continues but is being rapidly confirmed. It is explained that the pope was convinced that the speech was made with the intention of drawing from the Vatican an expression of the views entertained regarding the question of reconciliation, and therefore he issued instructions to all Vatican officials to maintain the strictest reserve on that subject. The Catholic press also was advised to leave the matter untouched. It is further stated on the authority of an official at the Vatican, that the Curia is satisfied that Signor Crispi, finding that a tendency toward a reapproachment existed between France and Germany and the Vatican, feared the isolation of Italy and hence sought a reconciliation with the Vatican. He has, it is stated, "been given to understand that the first condition of such a step will be the restitution of Rome to the pope." Furthermore "when Signor Crispi found that his overtures had resulted in failure he receded from the position he had taken and resumed his full attitude of hostility toward the Vatican." The church officials are said to consider that the incident constitutes a moral and political victory for the pope, and very naturally so.

Such an abortive result was to be expected. For while the pope would of course be glad to receive the $800,000 annual pension which the Italian government has appropriated for him regularly since May 13, 1871, but which he has steadfastly refused to accept, the pope will, it may safely be affirmed, continue to decline the pension so long as it is offered as condonement and satisfaction for seizing the pope's dominions, including the eternal city, and for the no less scandalous work, to papal view, of overthrowing the pope's spiritual power as well, by overthrowing the monastic orders, abrogating all chapters of collegiate churches, and abolishing all private benefices. When it is considered too that the capital value of the property which has accrued to the State by the temporal disestablishment of the pope exceeds $200,000,000 in value, it is easy to understand simply as a matter of finance the unwillingness of the pope to accept two-fifths of one per cent. interest on this amount. But beyond all this, the overthrow of the pope's temporal sway and the suppression of the religious orders are offenses to the Vatican which no monetary consideration can condone.

What, then, is the situation to-day so far as the pope and the Italian government are concerned? Obviously this: the pope is playing a waiting game. War is coming, and that war may result in loss to Italy, possibly in the downfall of the government. Then the pope's opportunity will have come. Then he will use his great influence with the victorious powers and especially with the Catholic governments to secure, if not a restoration of the old order, at least the giving up of Rome to the papal government with the yielding of the control of the religious orders to the Roman Curia, from whom it was wrested. And it should be recalled that the pope's influence is, and would be great, because his flat controls millions of voters. Furthermore, political considerations might make it an object on the part of the victorious power to minimize the influence of Italy and eliminating her as a great power from the chessboard of Europe. Meantime the fact should not be lost sight of that under the auspices of the International Catholic Association public opinion is being agitated and influenced in behalf of the restoration of the temporal power of the pope. But unless all signs fail nothing can be accomplished in this direction until the next war is fought to a finish. The results of that great contest are every way so uncertain as to make any prediction of the consequences to Italy and the Vatican valueless.—Christian Work.
