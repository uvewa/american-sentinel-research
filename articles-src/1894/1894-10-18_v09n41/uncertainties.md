# Uncertainties Log - Volume 9, Number 41 (October 18, 1894)

## General Notes

This issue was transcribed from Mistral OCR output. The OCR quality was generally good. Obvious OCR errors were corrected during transcription while preserving original spelling, punctuation, and capitalization exactly as in the original document.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 3, Line 93
- **OCR Text:** "50 cottin"
- **Transcribed as:** "50 cottin"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** This appears in a list of donations with amounts. Context suggests it should be "50 cents" but the OCR clearly shows "cottin". This may be an OCR error or an archaic abbreviation. Preserved as shown in OCR pending verification against original scan.

### Page 7, Line 385
- **OCR Text:** "Daily Juter-Ocean"
- **Transcribed as:** "Daily Juter-Ocean"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Should likely be "Daily Inter-Ocean" (a known Chicago newspaper). However, transcribed exactly as OCR shows pending verification.

### Page 7, Line 423
- **OCR Text:** "Ninctysis pages"
- **Transcribed as:** "Ninctysis pages"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** This appears in an advertisement context where it likely should read "Ninety-six pages" or similar, but transcribed exactly as OCR output shows.

### Page 7, Line 457
- **OCR Text:** "lemon edges"
- **Transcribed as:** "lemon edges"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** In book advertisement context, likely meant "gilt edges" or "golden edges" referring to page edge decoration, but transcribed as shown in OCR.

## OCR Corrections Made

The following obvious OCR errors were corrected:
- "preshytery" → "presbytery" (Page 3, in Frothingham quote)
- Various spacing and punctuation normalization
- Paragraph breaks normalized for readability

All substantive text was preserved exactly as in the original, including archaic spellings and punctuation.
