Speaking of the Stundists reminds me that, a week ago, I heard that almost every member of this body has been cleared out of the extensive province of Volhynia, and compulsorily settled in some other district. A few of these ill-starred brethren still remain near the capital of the province—Utomir, but the villagers have all been removed. I have this from a gentleman who has just returned from prolonged travel there. Five or six years ago there were probably a thousand Stundists in the Volhynian villages. Where are they now? How have they been deported? No one knows. The newspapers are ignorant and silent, and the Russian police tell no tales.

I heard a very good story the other day of the rigidity of the laws regulating printing in Russia. A Jew trader in Kief, who had a considerable stock of parasols and umbrellas on hand, determined to let the public know this, so he had a large card printed and hung in his window bearing the following announcement: "A large stock of umbrellas for sale at prices below cost." As soon as the card appeared a police officer entered the Jew's shop and demanded to see the censor's license authorizing the shopkeeper to print the card. The Jew could show none. He informed the policeman that he did not think so innocent a legend required a special authorization from the censor. The policeman thought otherwise, hauled the unfortunate Hebrew before a magistrate and had him fined heavily.—Ivan, in New York Observer.
