The churches of Canada greatly favor the sanctity of the Sabbath. In all our cities there has been much controversy, more or less, on Sabbath observance. In a few, street-cars are not allowed to run. We have no Sunday newspapers. The ministers of all denominations have so combined that funerals are not held on Sabbath days, except in cases of absolute necessity. The conference condemned bicycling for pleasure, and military, and similar parades. John Charlton, M. P., has been very conspicuous in his advocacy of Sabbath observance in public works, because of which his work was highly commended by some in conference; but others, who were probably his political opponents, condemned the introduction of his name into the report.—Northwestern Christian Advocate, Oct. 3.
