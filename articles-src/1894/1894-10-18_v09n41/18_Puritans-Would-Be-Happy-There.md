Valparaiso, Ind., Oct. 1.—When the new municipal administration came into power here last month the mayor issued an order to close all saloons on Sunday. Next the drug stores were closed. An order will be issued closing the cigar stores, restaurants, and livery stables, and to stop the sale of the Chicago papers on Sunday. To-day the women here gave notice that Sunday cooking will be dispensed with and a market will be opened next Saturday where cooked meats, bread, pies, and all kinds of eatables can be purchased ready for a Sunday dinner. Mayor Suman has an ordinance drawn, to be presented to the council next Friday night, to prohibit any person under 20 years of age from appearing on the streets after 9 o'clock P. M.—Daily Juter-Ocean, Oct. 2.
