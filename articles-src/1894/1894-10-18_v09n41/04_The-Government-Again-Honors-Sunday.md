Chicago has recently been greatly agitated over a proposed Sunday inspection of the letter carriers of that city.

The postal regulations require that all carriers get new uniforms twice a year, namely, in the spring and in the fall, and that the postmaster inspect them to see that the suits are of the proper cut and fit.

Last March Mr. Hesing, the postmaster at Chicago, held the inspection required by law on Sunday, and there was no protest. Recently he issued orders for another Sunday inspection, to partake somewhat of the nature of a dress parade. This provoked vigorous protest from the Sunday church element, with the result that the authorities at Washington interfered and sent Mr. Hesing a peremptory order, the pertinent part of which reads as follows:—

You will rescind your order for an inspection on the lake front and at a convenient hour on Sunday afternoon, in the corridors of the post-office and stations, if this is possible, and, if not, on the sidewalks or streets in front of the post-office and stations, you will have all the carriers in line and inspect them promptly.

Very respectfully,
F. H. Jones,
First Assistant Postmaster General.

The Chicago Herald of October 3 says:—

Mr. Jones did not come to his determination unaided. It is understood that Mr. Machen, of the free delivery department, who has charge of the whole carrier system, urged him to stop the parade. Mr. Machen witnessed the Sunday parade of last March, and the blare of the bands, and the military and political flavor of the thing shocked his sense of Sabbath propriety. Mr. Machen thinks the semi-annual inspection of new suits need not demand bands, auxiliaries, alignments or street marching. He thinks the inspection is in a measure perfunctory, and can just as well be carried on in private. Inspector Stuart, of Chicago, is also on record by telegram as saying: "Nonsense." If Mr. Bissell were here he would have probably given Mr. Hesing's idea a sharper veto.

There was a franked message to-day in Mr. Jones' hands which was carefully guarded for an hour. When Mr. Jones had read it and shown it to all the chiefs he announced his decision. There is little doubt this was a message from Mr. Bissell endorsing his action. Mr. Jones was likewise influenced by the receipt of the dispatch from Rev. Mr. Frothingham, stated clerk of the Christian Union:—

"The preshytery of Chicago, consisting of over two hundred ministers and churches, have unanimously protested against the proposed parade of postal employees next Sunday in Chicago for the inspection of new uniforms. A street parade is unnecessary; it is an infringement on the rights of men, and is an offense against the best sentiment of the city, which is trying to preserve Sunday to the working people. The community of Chicago is much aroused over the matter."

"That settles it," said Mr. Jones, "there will be no parade."

The same paper further says in the same issue:—

The proposed parade of the letter carriers assumed national importance on Monday when Mr. Meloy, on behalf of the churches and acting under advice of Lawyer Gault, attorney for the Sunday Rest League, began flooding the department at Washington with telegraphic protests against what was considered an unseemly desecration of the Sabbath. Besides the protests filed Monday, Mr. Meloy yesterday forwarded the following:—

"The proposed parade of letter carriers on the Sabbath, ordered by authority of the Government in your department, is a violation of Christian sentiment, of the rights of labor and of the quiet and good order of our city. We petition you to forbid it.

"W. C. Gray, Editor of the Interior.

"Edward Goodman, Editor of the Standard.

"J. S. Cantwell, Editor of the Universalist.

"Arthur Edwards, Editor of the Christian Advocate.

"J. E. Berry, Editor of the Epworth Herald.

"Simeon Gilbert, Editor of the Advocate.

"James W. Wilson, of the Farm, Field and Fireside.

"General C. H. Howard, of the Western Rural.

"E. B. Graham, Editor of the Midland.

"J. A. Collins, Editor of the Christian Instructor."

This probably had its influence also in deciding the matter in the minds of the Washington authorities, and in securing the order for a simple inspection instead of a dress parade. But though the parade was declared off, Mr. Meloy was not fully satisfied. As related by the Herald, he said:—

I should have preferred that the inspection be on some other day than Sunday. Still, this is a great concession. While this action of the administration is most gratifying, I have no feeling of triumph as if it were a victory over Mr. Hesing. No, there is no feeling of that kind.

It is a fortunate thing for the postmaster that the people at Washington have taken such action. I told Mr. Hesing that if there was a Sunday parade there would be a political post mortem in his office as a result.

The most objectionable features of the affair have been removed and the religious sentiment of the country will be better satisfied. There has been no politics in this matter. In politics I am a Republican, but not a partisan. In this matter the action taken at Washington shows how strong this Democratic administration is—I will say that.

The Herald suggests that "perhaps the postmaster and the dominies can compromise by the former agreeing to omit the band next Sunday in the coat-and-trouser exhibition of the letter carriers, and by the latter agreeing to give their congregations a sermon now and then on a scriptural instead of a political text."

The whole thing shows the arrogancy of the "religious element." That element has learned that it "holds the United States Government in its hands," and it is not slow to use its power.

Of course, it was claimed that the order for Sunday inspection infringed upon the rights of the carriers to Sunday rest, but Mr. Hesing had given public notice that any one who so desired would be excused from attending the inspection, thus leaving every man free in the matter. But not one objected or asked to be excused. And again it is demonstrated that the anxiety of the Sunday preachers is to protect and honor Sunday, not to secure human rights.
