Bishop Keane then went on to talk at length on the position of the pope on the leading questions of the day, and especially as they bore upon America. He believes the Church and the State should march side by side in solving the questions of the day. The questions which absorb the attention of the pope are the social and economic questions of the day. He realizes it is with great questions of this character that the world will have to deal in the near future, and he realizes that the forces that will solve them will not be the monarchical governments of the world, but the democracies; and the democracies will have to be dominated by what Huxley referred to as the ethical force, by moral force, by the power of conscience, and by the power of religion.

It is for this reason, said the bishop, that the pope is turning his face to the United States and France, because he realizes these two leading republics of the world are the principal hopes of the happy solution of the problems of the time.—The Pilot, Sept. 29.
