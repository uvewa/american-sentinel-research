The first fruit of Pope Leo's encyclical on the reunion of Christendom is the visit to the Vatican of a delegation of Anglican clergymen. His holiness spoke of the joy which recent submissions to the Catholic Church had given him, and declared that the English people were the pioneers of truth in their sincere spirit of religious craving.

Cardinal Vaughan, in opening the Catholic conference in Preston, Eng., Sept. 10, spoke concerning the reunion of Christendom. The movement had been so rapid in the Anglican Church within the last fifty years, he said, that it had been difficult to distinguish often the Roman and Anglican churches. The movement was spreading fast in the United Kingdom.—Northwestern Chronicle, Oct. 5
