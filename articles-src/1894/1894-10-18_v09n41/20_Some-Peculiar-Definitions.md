Father O'Neil's brave protest against allowing the Junior Order of American Mechanics to turn a public school of Middleboro' into an A. P. A. temple has elicited from the representative of that order the following unique definition of "non-sectarianism," as understood by its members:

We believe that the Bible should be read in our public schools, not to teach sectarianism, but to inculcate its teaching. It is the recognized standard of all moral and civil law, we therefore believe that our children should be educated in its teachings, but that no dogma or creed should be taught at the same time.

The only prototype for this view of strict neutrality is found in the notorious Father Chiniquy's declaration of religious freedom:

Though I am in favor of liberty of conscience, in its highest sense, I think that the atheist ought to be punished like the murderer and the thief—for his doctrines tend to make a murderer and a thief of every man.

—The Pilot (Catholic), Boston, Sept. 29.
