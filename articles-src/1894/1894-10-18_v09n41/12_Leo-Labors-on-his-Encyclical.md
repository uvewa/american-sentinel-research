Rome, Oct. 3.—The pope has suspended his regular audience and other routine business and has closeted himself while devoting himself solely to work on his encyclical letter in regard to the policy of the church in the United States. Yesterday evening his holiness received Archbishop Ferrata, apostolic nuncio to Paris, to whom he privately expressed a wish that the Duc d'Orleans will not act as a pretender to the throne of France.—Washington Post, Oct. 4.
