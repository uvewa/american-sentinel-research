Howell, Aug. 23.—Catholic crosses and Protestant banners mingled in the great Sunday-school parade yesterday. Catholic priests and Protestant ministers jostled each other as they marched side by side as friends in a common cause. It was the first time the Catholics had ever taken part, and the best of feeling pervaded the gathering. The procession included two 12-horse teams, one 10-horse, one 8-horse, ten 6-horse, and forty-six 4-horse teams, and the wagons were gaily decorated with bunting. Children of all sects joined in the singing as they marched to the grove. It is believed 10,000 people gathered there. All the stores in town closed in honor of the occasion.—Kalamazoo (Mich.) Gazette.
