Centreville, Aug. 23.—About five thousand people attended the Sunday-school rally here yesterday. A special train from Three Rivers brought one thousand and twelve persons accompanied by the Three Rivers Concertboard. About sixty schools numbering two thousand and sixty-eight scholars took part in the parade. Governor Rich delivered an address on the Sunday-school as a factor in the promotion of good citizenship, and Rev. Washington Gardner, Secretary of State, delivered an oration on the Sunday-school and loyalty to the State and nation. Speeches were also delivered by E. A. Hough, of Jackson, and Rev. O. F. Kiefer of this place. The president of the village, M. Sabin, cordially welcomed the assembly in appropriate remarks.—Kalamazoo, (Mich.) Gazette.
