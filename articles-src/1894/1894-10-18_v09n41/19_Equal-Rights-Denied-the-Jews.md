Budapest, Oct. 8.—The House of Magnates in Hungary, has rejected the bill recently introduced providing for the enlarging of the religious rights of the Jews in Hungary.

Court Marshal Szeczen, a notoriously intolerant man, led the reactionist clericals in the attack on the bill.

London, Oct. 8.—The Standard's Vienna correspondent predicts that the Hungarian Cabinet will be forced to resign on the religious question before the end of the next two or three weeks.

The crisis, he says, will be serious and Dr. Wekerle's resignation is imminent.—New York Sun, Oct. 9.
