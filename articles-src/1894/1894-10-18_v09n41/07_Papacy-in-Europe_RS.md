It cannot be denied that there is, at the present time, a revival of Roman Catholicism in this Old World of ours. In Great Britain every one knows that the Romish clergy have of late assumed a boldness, a spirit of propagandism, which becomes a danger to the country. Convents and monasteries are being established on all sides; there are forty of them in the county of Sussex alone. Churches and cathedrals are being erected, and "conversions" are taking place. In the Anglican Church there is an alarming progress toward the popish rites and superstitions, thousands of churches having adopted during the past few years the use of candles, early celebration of the mass, incense, confession, etc. The Romish clergy in one diocese alone (that of Salford) boast of 900 "conversions" during the past year. Who could have expected such things in the land of Cromwell and the Covenanters?

In France the death-fight between the republic and the church, which found its expression seventeen years ago in Gambetta's celebrated utterance: "Le cléricalisme, voilà Penneu!." ("clericalism is the foe") has come to a sort of truce. The people are not, to any considerable extent, more religious than they used to be; fashion, pleasure and immorality hold the sway in Paris and our large cities more than ever. But there is, at the same time, a curious sense of respect perceptible even in the most worldly newspapers, for the things which pertain to religion, and especially to the Romish religion; the pope and the priests are not derided and abused as they were a few years ago; the pope's encyclical letters and speeches are carefully reported and commented upon. Following the lead of the late Cardinal Lavigerie, the bishops have become reconciled to the republican form of government, and the pope has encouraged them in this new departure. The great reform which the Liberals under Napoleon III. were clamoring for, and which the early republican governments held out as imminent—the separation of Church and State—has been shelved by all parties except by the socialists, who as yet do not count. The Boulangist agitation revealed the fact that the masses of the people crave for a strong government which must of necessity lean upon the church; and though Boulanger is dead, Boulangism is still alive—i.e., the reactionary tendency which must end in clerical rule.

In Germany, statistics show that the Roman Catholic population increases in the Protestant parts of the country. The kulturkampf (war against Rome) has been abandoned long ago, while it was but recently that the young Protestant emperor was seen at the Vatican paying his respects to Leo XIII.

Even in the Slavonic countries, submitted to the Greek Church, Rome is making some progress. For the first time an ambassador of the Vatican is accredited to the court of the czar, who persecutes the Stundists to death. And a party for reunion to Rome is said to exist in the Orthodox Church.

What are the causes of this recrudescence of Romanism?

In Protestant countries we are afraid the main cause is the weakness and loss of power of the Evangelical churches. As they have grown rich and prosperous, the Protestants have forsaken, to a great extent, that puritanic spirit which was the strength of the Reformation. From their primitive simplicity of worship they have come down to elaborate services, beautiful and luxurious buildings which are imitations of Roman Catholic mediavial architecture, and thus have led their sons and daughters to the very threshold of Rome, with which Protestants will never be able to compete, try as they may, for finery, music, and display. Moreover, it is sadly evident that, in Great Britain especially, the work of the Reformation did not go deep enough, and that many Romish errors—such as baptismal regeneration and apostolic succession—were left in the prayer-book as seeds for future apostasy. Wherever a notion of a visible universal church is entertained, logic must lead to the Roman Catholic position.

But we believe that the main cause of this reaction toward Rome in Protestant lands lies in the fact that the Bible does not hold in those countries the same place that it did three centuries ago. They people turned away from the infallibility of a man to the infallible Book; but now the Book is no more deemed infallible; the "higher" criticism has submitted it to an ordeal as severe as that of the Inquisition in times past. The Inquisition burned the Bible, but the higher critics are tearing it to pieces. And yet there is a craving in the human soul, and especially in the soul which has come into contact with the gospel, for a moral certainty, for a divine, infallible authority. We know a case of a distinguished woman, the wife of a French pastor, whose faith was shattered by what she overheard of her husband's conversations with his colleagues on the Bible and its so-called inaccuracies. Intensely religious, the poor woman, thus deprived of her faith in the Bible, found at last what she thought to be a blessed certitude in the fold of Rome, and for ten years before her husband's death she was a Romanist without any one knowing it but her husband and her confessori Lately, however, she returned to the pure gospel, confessing on her dying bed that Rome had not given her the promised peace, and she died trusting in Christ as her Saviour.

In France the reasons for this revival of Catholicism are many. The first is, the shallowness and powerlessness of what is called "free thought," with which, at one time, our leading politicians had foolishly hoped to replace the old superstitions. People will rather eat decayed food than nothing. "Free thought," materialism, positivism, agnosticism, or whatever name modern infidelity assumes, is nothing. It gives no hope for the future, no strength for the present. Under the secular influence of the schools a new generation has grown, utterly ignorant of God, and tremendously materialistic. Learning has not been the panacea which it had been hoped it would be. Crime, drunkenness, lawlessness, have increased in proportion with the number of schools. There have been more divorces in France during the past five years than in England in thirty years. Illegal unions are numerous, infanticide common, and there is a decrease in the population of about twenty thousand souls every year.

No wonder that those who think and who retain some love for virtue are afraid of such a state of things, and, for want of a better one, appeal to the Roman Catholic religion as the only power which can stay this tide of immorality, of which she has been the main factor.

Another cause of the Roman Catholic reaction in France is the marvelous skill of the present pope in adapting himself to modern phraseology and aspirations. History shows us that "Rome never changes," and yet, serpent like, it has a wonderful ability to change its appearance, to insinuate itself in the confidence and love of the peoples by a seeming concession on almost every point of importance to them. The republican form of government, for instance, seems to have rooted itself in the French soil, and to have become a permanent institution in this country; the pope has issued commands to the French bishops that henceforth they should accept the established government, and not identify themselves, as they had done before, with the dead-and-gone monarchies. What is called the "question sociale"—i.e., the questions of capital and labor, of rich and poor—is agitating the minds of our people, as everywhere. The pope has carefully prepared an encyclical letter on the question full of liberal sentiments and evangelical utterances; and a host of Roman Catholic lecturers and journalists, priests and laymen . . . have gone to work among the masses with the aim of forming a Socialist-Catholic party. Thus we may foresee the most stupendous combination that could ever have been dreamed, and which, if really consummated, will be full of danger to the future of the world—the marriage of red democracy with papacy, the beast whose deadly wounds have been healed, at least in appearance, and which seems as strong as it ever has been.
