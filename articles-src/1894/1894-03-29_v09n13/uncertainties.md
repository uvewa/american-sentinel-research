## OCR Corrections and Uncertainties

### Page 1, Masthead
- **OCR read:** "No. 43 Bozo Straffer, New York"
- **Likely should be:** "No. 43 Bond Street, New York"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - This is the known address; OCR misread "Bond Street" as "Bozo Straffer"

- **OCR read:** "CALVIN P. BOLLMAY"
- **Likely should be:** "CALVIN P. BOLLMAN"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - Known associate editor name; OCR error on final letters

- **OCR read:** "WILLIAM H. BUKER"
- **Likely should be:** "WILLIAM H. McKEE"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - Known associate editor; OCR significantly misread surname

### Page 1, Article 1 (Protestantism)
- **OCR read:** "Dec. 14, 1898, p. 15" (for New York Independent citation)
- **Context issue:** This appears to be a date error - the article is from 1894, so a citation to 1898 is impossible
- **Likely should be:** "Dec. 14, 1893, p. 15"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Makes chronological sense given World's Parliament of Religions was 1893

### Page 3, Article "Old and New Style"
- **OCR read:** "crepation" (in phrase "Mosaic account of crepation")
- **Should be:** "creation"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - obvious OCR error

- **OCR read:** "inoffacable"
- **Should be:** "ineffaceable"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - context clear

### Page 4, "A Plea Before a Georgia Jury"
- **OCR read:** "self-siditifying"
- **Should be:** "self-stultifying"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - context and common phrase

- **OCR read:** "detusion"
- **Should be:** "delusion"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - context ("mockery, a delusion, and a snare")

- **OCR read:** "Bible Subbath"
- **Should be:** "Bible Sabbath"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - obvious OCR error

- **OCR read:** "disjects member"
- **Should be:** "disjecta membra" (Latin phrase)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH - common Latin phrase meaning "scattered remains"

### Page 5-6, "Progress of the National Religion"
- **OCR read:** "Steuakin pro tempore"
- **Should be:** "Speaker pro tempore"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - standard congressional term

- **OCR read:** "irraggiant"
- **Should be:** "religion" (in phrase "national religion")
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - context suggests this, though OCR corruption is severe

### Page 7, "Defend the Constitution"
- **OCR read:** "devontly"
- **Should be:** "devoutly"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - obvious typo in quoted resolution

- **OCR read:** "Mohrensneelans"
- **Should be:** "Mohammedans"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH - context lists religious groups

### General Note
Multiple OCR errors throughout related to proper names, technical terms, and older spellings. Where original spellings like "to-day" appear, these have been preserved as they are period-appropriate.
