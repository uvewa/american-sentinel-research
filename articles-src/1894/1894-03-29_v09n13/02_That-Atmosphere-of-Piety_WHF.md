A WRITER in the Catholic Mirror of September 2, 1893, in giving a description of the World's Fair, and especially of the three Spanish caravels of Columbus, says:

Oh that the wheel of time might turn back and dip the wide world and all of the earth in that atmosphere of piety in which the rude sailors of four centuries ago were born and bred.

The pious atmosphere of those days was of such a nature that wicked men like Huss and Jerome were not allowed to breathe out their poisonous soul-destroying errors to contaminate the purity of the hearts and minds of the people. And when they persisted in their wickedness they were not deemed fit to live, but expiated their crimes at the stake. That atmosphere of piety put such a spirit of love and gentleness in the hearts of those rude sailors that they were ready to mutiny and murder Columbus, unless he would grant their requests. Such an atmosphere proved very conducive to the life and growth of that lovely plant—the Spanish Inquisition.

What a blessed experience it would be, indeed, if the wheel of time would revolve backward and plunge the wide world once more into that pious atmosphere.

Again, in the same article, the writer says:—

Pity it is that Catholic piety is not allowed to bring its elevating influence to play on every heart.

The Inquisition made it very easy to bring the "elevating influence" of "Catholic piety" "to play on every heart." Like methods will once more produce like results. Apostate Protestantism is fast turning the wheel of time backward, and soon the wide world and all the earth will be dipped in that atmosphere of "piety" in which the rude sailors of four centuries ago were born and bred; and the elevating (?) influence of Catholic piety will soon be brought to play on every heart.

W. H. FALCONER.
