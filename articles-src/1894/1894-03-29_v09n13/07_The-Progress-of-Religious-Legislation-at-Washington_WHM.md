The Washington Post, of March 21, under the head of "Capital Chat," has the following paragraph:—

Thousands of petitions have come through the mails within the last fortnight from religious societies and others interested asking that favorable action be taken upon the joint resolution now before the House Judiciary Committee to insert the name of the Deity in the Federal Constitution. Some of the petitions are several yards long and all are numerously signed. They come principally from the States of Ohio and Pennsylvania. They are addressed to the two Houses of Congress.

The committee has decided that it will not give a hearing to persons who desire to oppose the resolution, but it is generally understood that the resolution will be reported adversely, although it was at first intended to take no action on it whatever, but to permit it to slumber in the committee.

This is the most pronounced expression in reference to the attitude of the Judiciary Committee as to the religious amendment to the Constitution, and the action that the committee proposes to take, which has yet been given out. The interpolation into the preamble of the Constitution, which is sought, is so palpably in antagonism to the First Amendment and so clearly a reversion to a Church and State polity that it seems astonishing that any man possessing sufficient intelligence to reach and retain a seat in Congress could be found willing to offer, much less champion, such a bill. But the measure is known to actually have its supporters, to the number of two at least, even in the House Judiciary Committee itself. Thus, however ignominious a fate may befall this amendment now, this fact is vividly suggestive as to what may be the success eventually of this long-sought treason to both government and religion.

Mr. Morse's bill, "to protect the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, as a day of rest and worship in the District of Columbia," it is understood, will be referred by the House Committee on the District of Columbia, in whose hands it now is, to the District Commissioners for their action thereupon. It is not known yet what the views of the commissioners are upon the matter. Mr. Douglas, who was an outspoken and rabid legal and political religionist, is no longer a member of the board. Had such a measure been presented to the commissioners while he was one of them it would have been perfectly certain what the recommendation would have been. In fact he once embodied in an annual report to the President, regarding district affairs, a suggestion as to the enactment of just such a law for the district.

The fact that the House Committee makes this disposition of the bill argues nothing decisive in reference to it either way, but shows that the committee dislikes to assume the responsibility of definite action either way, and wishes to share the onus of whatever is done in regard to it jointly with the commissioners, or perhaps shoulder upon them the entire responsibility of the decision.

The bill is openly and professedly religious in its character, not striving to conceal itself under the mask of a civil measure as was the case when presented in different form, to previous Congresses. No commissioner, committeeman, or congressman, can mistake the purpose of this bill. Every one who favors it will be openly taking his place among those who favor legislation by Congress upon religious subjects, and the establishment of religion by congressional decree.
