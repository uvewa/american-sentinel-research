# Defend the Constitution.

ONCE more an effort is made to turn the Constitution of the United States into a religious creed. From time to time attempts have been made to introduce the name of God. They have been wisely defeated on the ground that the Constitution is a political, not a religious, document, and it is not the work of our legislators to define their religious opinions, or those of their constituents, in that instrument. But now the attempt is made not only to introduce a declaration of faith in God, but also of faith in Jesus Christ and the Bible. The resolution introduced by Mr. Morse of Massachusetts into the House of Representatives and by Mr. Frye of Maine into the Senate proposes to insert in the preamble of the national Constitution the following declaration:

We, the people of the United States, devontly acknowledging the supreme authority and just government of Almighty God in all the affairs of men and nations, grateful to him for our civil and religious liberties, and encouraged by the assurance of his Word to invoke his guidance as a Christian nation, according to his appointed way by Jesus Christ our Lord.

The proposition is a most extraordinary one. Not only God, but the Bible and Jesus Christ, are to be introduced into the Constitution of a Government which is not founded on a theocracy or upon Jesus Christ or the Bible, but upon the equal political rights of men of all races and all religious faiths. It is a bit of evangelical cant, which is a direct attack upon the American principle of the separation of Church and State.

This pious attempt to adulterate the Constitution with evangelical theology will not strengthen, but weaken it. Let this precedent be accepted, and there is no telling where it will stop. Once introduce God, Christ, and the Bible, and then the next step, perhaps, would be to introduce the Trinity, the doctrine of the resurrection, and everlasting punishment. Then it would be necessary to include the miracles of Jesus, Samson, and Moses, and the dogma that the world was made in six days; and by and by the Nicene Creed or the Westminster Catechism might follow.

It may be perfectly true that the great majority of the people of the United States believe in God and the Bible as a divine revelation, and Jesus Christ as a divine being; but this does not furnish the slightest reason why the Constitution of the United States should be turned into a religious creed, in direct contempt of the religious beliefs of Jews and Unitarians and Universalists, and many other Christians, who do not accept the orthodox creed, and who do not believe in excluding from political fellowship naturalized citizens, whether Buddhists, Mohrensneelans, Brahmans, Shintoists, or what not, who call God by some other name, who regard Jesus Christ as a man, and who revere as sacred some other book. Mr. Morse and Mr. Frye were not sent to Congress as evangelists, and the resolution they have introduced is nothing more nor less than an invasion of the Constitution and an attack upon the liberties of the American people. Let the Constitution be defended against such mistaken friends.—Christian Register, March 15.
