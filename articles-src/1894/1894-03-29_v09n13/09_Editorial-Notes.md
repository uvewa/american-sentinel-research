As one receiving the American Sentinel, without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the Sentinel need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.

The president of a college in Kentucky says: "I am a reader of the AMERICAN SENTINEL, and I feel deeply interested in its work. The questions treated are all-important to every true lover of liberty, and I certainly recommend it to all good American citizens."

A Catholic paper states that "twenty-three converts to the Catholic faith were received into the church recently as a result of a mission of one week given to the men in St. Patrick's Cathedral, Fifth avenue, in this city. A still more remarkable result followed a recent mission [revival] in the Church of St. Francis Xavier, in West Sixteenth Street, where the number of converts was over seventy."

The work of deluging Congress with petitions in favor of the so-called Christian amendment to the Constitution of the United States has begun. These petitions will doubtless be poured in much as were the petitions for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, and when names have been exhausted some scheme will be devised whereby the same petitioners can be counted again, and even several times over if necessary. As in the case of the Fair the end will be held to justify the means.

In a recent pastoral letter Bishop Mesmer, of Wisconsin, says:—

It is humiliating to see how frequently a Catholic Church appears to be erected solely for the purpose of drawing customers to the saloon next door. I hope the laws of the land will eventually stop this evil.

What a commentary in this on the boast of the Catholic Church that she is the support of society and the stay of civil order! Here is one of her own bishops lamenting the fact that it so frequently happens that Catholic churches are simply feeders to saloons; and having no power to prevent this, he hopes "the laws of the land will eventually stop the evil."

Some one has sent us a newspaper clipping which says that "Justice Brewer of the United States Supreme Court teaches a Bible class in the First Congregational Church of Washington." Well, that is all right. Justice Brewer in his capacity as a citizen has an inalienable right to have and to teach any religion he pleases. It is only when in his capacity as judge he subverts the Constitution of the United States, virtually nullifying the First Amendment, that we criticize him.

Neither the AMERICAN SENTINEL nor anybody else has anything to do with Justice Brewer's personal relations to God, nor with his manner or place of worship. These are his own concern.

A Georgia attorney is credited with this utterance in one of the Adventist Sunday cases:—

They are teaching here that the Roman Catholic Church established Sunday. I don't care how we got Sunday as the Sabbath day. We got it and incorporated it in the statute book of Georgia. If it came from the Catholic Church, it is all right; if it came from the devil, it is all right.

In other words, "might makes right," and if any man doubts it and dissents practically, put him in jail or send him to the chain-gang. The Adventists, be it remembered, do not object to others keeping Sunday; they only ask that they be not required to keep it, because to keep it is to render homage to antichrist.

It is stated that the proposed "Christian" amendment to the Constitution will not be reported, for some time at least, to the House by the committee to which it was committed. It is probable that no action whatever will be taken in the Senate, at least not at present. But what is the difference? The proposed change in the Constitution was virtually made Feb. 29, 1892, by the Supreme Court, and Congress has already enacted legislation in harmony with the opinion of the dictum of the court, namely, that "this is a Christian nation." This was one of the chief reasons urged why Congress should acknowledge Sunday as the Christian Sabbath, which it did in the World's Fair legislation. The only practical purpose that the National Reform movement can now serve is to blind people to the truth that the principles of our Government have been already subverted. While National Reformers clamor for a change in the Constitution, Congress and the courts go right along trenching upon the most sacred rights of the people, in defiance of the Constitution as it reads, but in perfect harmony with that which Justice Brewer, speaking for the Supreme Court, says it means.

The following note from the New York Independent, of March 22, reveals the hollow mockery of much that passes for Christianity in these days of sham and hypocrisy:—

The suit for breach of promise brought in Washington against the most distinguished member of Congress from Kentucky opens to the whole country a very sad chapter in the life of one who has been a great favorite both in political and ecclesiastical life. Colonel Breckinridge, it seems, does not deny his long-continued criminal relations with the prosecutrix, only that he had ever promised to marry her, and he seems to see no great shame in his sin, and he expects that all this exposure will not interfere at all with his triumphant re-election. He may be right in his anticipation, but we cannot do less than express our astonishment and pain, and our hope that his sin will not be ignored or condoned by the representatives of the church of which he has been such a shining light. And we must also express our detestation of the excuses made in his behalf by his personal friends, one of them a clergyman of fame. Such excuses would undermine the whole structure of social morality, by teaching that a man has no power of self-restraint.

Mr. Breckinridge, it will be remembered, was the father of the Breckinridge Sunday bill, and an ardent champion of governmental religion in all the various forms in which it has yet been exhibited in this country. We do not rejoice in his downfall, but trust that it may enable some hitherto charmed by the siren song of National Reform, to see that morality and religion to be of any value must be a personal matter, a force in the individual life; and that unless it does reside in the individual all religious profession, whether by the individual or the nation, is only mockery.

Recently the House of the Massachusetts Legislature passed an act abolishing the annual State fast-day on the ground that it had become a meaningless farce. But to this view of the case Rev. J. M. Foster objects. In a communication to the Christian Cynosure, he says:—

After the war the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution were adopted, making the black man forever free and conferring the rights of citizenship. But these amendments have been inoperative. Caste and race prejudice in the South have deprived our colored citizens of their constitutional rights. The question now is, Shall these amendments be repealed, or enforced? . . . Our Government ought to have the power to punish these outrages against the colored people of the South. There is a missing link in the United States Constitution. We need a Sixteenth Amendment to make the last two operative. There are no Christian governments on earth. Christianity is the only solution for caste and race prejudice. This we must have.

And this is an illustration to show that we ought to have a so-called Christian amendment as the missing link between the Government and the Massachusetts fast-day, and other similar days. Instead of abolishing them because not observed, give the Government the constitutional power to enforce them and to punish their non-observance. A fine scheme truly! But such is National Reform.

One of the best numbers of the Religious Liberty Library yet issued, is No. 19, "Protestantism, True and False." This tract is now ready, and ought to be given a very wide circulation. Price, 4 cents; $3.00 per hundred. Order of Pacific Press, 43 Bond Street, New York City.
