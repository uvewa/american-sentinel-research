REPRESENTATIVE MORSE, of Massachusetts, on March 10, introduced the following bill in the House:—

**A BILL**

To protect the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, as a day of rest and worship in the District of Columbia.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That on the first day of the week, known as the Lord's day, set apart by general consent in accordance with divine appointment as a day of rest and worship, it shall be unlawful to perform any labor, except works of necessity and mercy, and work by those who religiously observe Saturday, if performed in such a way as not to involve or disturb others; also to open places of business or traffic, except in the case of drug stores for the dispensing of medicines; also to make contracts or transact other commercial business; also to engage in noisy assessments or amusements for gain, or entertainments for which admittance fees are charged; also to join in public processions, except funerals, which last shall not use music; also to perform any court service, except in connection with arrests of criminals and service of process to prevent fraud.

Sec. 2. That the penalty for violating any provision of this act shall be a fine of not less than ten dollars for the first offense; for second or subsequent offenses, a fine not exceeding fifty dollars and imprisonment for not less than ten nor more than thirty days, and one year's forfeiture of license, if any is held by the offender or his employer.

SEC. 3. That this Act shall take effect upon its passage.

This is more distinctively and openly a religious bill than the measure for the enforcement of the observance of Sunday, in the District of Columbia, introduced in the previous Congresses by W. C. P. Breckinridge, of Kentucky. It would seem that the mantle of Mr. Breckinridge has fallen upon Representative Morse, for he is the only member of the House now devoting himself to the furtherance of legislative religion in Congress.

In the Congressional Record of March 9, containing the proceedings of the previous day, is the following discussion which arose out of an item in the appropriation bill for the District of Columbia:—

MR. MORSE. Mr. Chairman, there is one single item in this bill to which I propose to address myself, . . . On page 26 is the following item:

For one new engine-house for No. 2 company, to be located on reservation at intersection of Ohio Avenue, Thirteenth and C Streets northwest. $12,000.

Now, Mr. Chairman, I have no earthly objection to the engine-house, or to the $12,000 appropriated for it, but I have a serious objection to the location of this engine-house, for the reason that it wipes out the mission chapel which has been doing great good in this city. I hold in my hand the picture of this mission chapel, which cost the benevolent people of this city nearly $5,000. I have not, Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the House of Representatives, the slightest interest in this matter except pro bono publico. I have no interest except such as all good and right-minded citizens should have in any benevolent work which is being done in the direction of elevating men and women in the scale of humanity, elevating men and women to a saving knowledge of God. . . . The new engine-house can be located elsewhere.

Since this action has been known, and since this appropriation has been passed by the committee, I have received a number of letters from distinguished persons in this city protesting against this mission station being removed or destroyed. I have one here from which I would like to read a brief extract.

Washington, D. C., February 24, 1894.

DEAR MR. MORSE: . . . I sincerely trust that the objectionable Ross in the appropriation bill will be eliminated from the same manner, if any be allowed to pass the same, and I have not heard section of our beautiful city unmolested, or better, helped by every influence for good that can possibly be brought to bear. . . . Yours very sincerely,

W. B. ROBESCO,
Superintendent Bethany Mission.

HON. ELDER A. MORSE,
The Sharehouse, City.

Now, I do not ask for the wiping out of the appropriation. I do not ask that the engine-house shall not be built; but I ask of the committee when this item is reached to accept an amendment to locate the engine-house somewhere else. . . . This mission station which it is proposed to destroy and to wipe out is located in one of the worst sections of the city. I have attended services there myself on a Sunday night. The audience was composed largely of persons who do not go to church anywhere else. There were soldiers in the audience; I should judge there were intemperate persons, from their appearance. I know that the young men who are members of the Young Men's Christian Association, and the members of the Society of Christian Endeavor, have for twenty years been conducting services there. They hold religious services there on Friday and Sunday night and the average attendance, I am told, has been something like one hundred. On Sabbath afternoon they hold a Sunday-school, and the average attendance is one hundred fifteen.

Now, it seems to me that it would be exceedingly unwise, from the lowest standpoint of the financial aspect of the question, to blow out this light, to pull down this moral light-house, stationed in that dark place, even for so laudable a purpose as to locate an engine-house, to put out a different kind of fire. [Laughter.] . . .

Now, Mr. Chairman, I have no right to detain the House further, as the hour is late, but I simply desire to send to the clerk's desk and have read in my time a brief statement of the work of this mission, and I have also obtained from the chairman of the Committee on Printing permission to print in the Record a cut showing the mission building. I think that it is a very important matter to this city whether this mission is to continue or is to be wipe out.

MR. COOSWELL. Do you say that you are going to put that cut in the Record? . . . Do I understand my colleague has asked permission to print in the Record a cut of this Bethel? I ask that question for information. If he does ask that, I object.

MR. MORSE. I will say that I propose to conform entirely to the rules of the House in regard to the matter.

MR. COOSWELL. I want to know if the gentleman has asked permission. I understood him to say so; and if so, I have the right to object.

THE CHAIRMAN. The chair has submitted no request. If the gentleman will proffer his request, the chair will submit it.

MR. COOSWELL. My colleague stated a while ago that he submitted at the same time a cut of that Bethel to put in the Record. That sometimes is taken here as unanimous consent.

MR. MORSE. I did not ask consent of the House to illustrate my remarks, but I asked and obtained in writing the consent of the chairman of the Committee on Printing, in conformity to the rule of the House as printed on the last page of the Record.

MR. COOSWELL. If he does, I object.

MR. MORSE. I will say in regard to this matter, if my colleague from Massachusetts will read the condition upon which members are allowed to illustrate their remarks in the Record, he will see that I have complied with those conditions and his objection does not count, and I have a right to insert the illustration in connection with my remark if I choose to do so. I think, however, I shall not insist on my right in view of the objection, as I do not want to injure the chance of success of my amendment, and I only wished to use the cut to show what a substantial chapel and mission building it was proposed to wipe out and destroy to make room for an engine-house.

MR. COOSWELL. I know that the relations existing between my colleague and the chairman of the Committee on Printing are very pleasant; but I will object to having that cut printed in the Record, if for no other reason, on the constitutional ground that we have no right to recognize religious or the sects thereof.

MR. KEN. That is right.

THE CHAIRMAN. Objection is made.

The Record of March 11 continues the subject thus:—

The clerk read as follows:—

For one new engine-house for No. 2 company, to be located on reservation at intersection of Ohio avenue, Thirteenth, and C streets northwest. $12,000.

MR. MORSE. Mr. Chairman, I offer the amendment which I send to the desk.

The amendment was read, as follows:

Strike out the paragraph just read and insert in lieu thereof the following:

"For one new engine house for No. 2 company, to be located on reservation at intersection of Ohio avenue, Thirteenth, and C streets northwest. $12,000."

MR. MORSE. Mr. Chairman, in addition to what I said the other day in support of this amendment, I desire to call attention once more to the fact that this proposed new engine house, if it is to be built at the point indicated in the bill, is to be on the present site of a mission station of the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church. That chapel, called the Bethany Mission, was built upon that site twenty years ago, and has been maintained as a mission ever since that time.

The building cost $4,600, which was contributed by the benevolent people of this city. A religious service is held there on every Sabbath evening, a Sabbath school on Sabbath afternoon, and a regular Friday evening meeting. . . . Many of those who attend there are people who would not go to a service anywhere else. It is an entirely benevolent and non-sectarian work.

My genial colleague from the Sixth district [Mr. Cogswell]-objected the other day to a permission which the Committee on Printing had given me to print a picture of this mission house in the Record.

I believe that my colleague objected on constitutional grounds, on the ground that this was recognizing some particular sect.

Now, I find on page 36 of this bill that it appropriates $45,700 for purely sectarian institutions, and yet, after recommending such an appropriation as that, it is proposed to wipe out this little poor lone missionary chapel! I really hope that the committee will consent to my amendment.

MR. COOSWELL. Mr. Chairman, this amendment strikes me as displaying an equal mixture of audacity and unconstitutionality. [Laughter.] In the first place, the reservation to which it relates is a small one, the property of the United States, which this Bethel has occupied for twenty years free from rent, and never should have occupied at all; and now, when the Government needs the reservation as a site for a public building, the people who are interested in this Bethel, represented on this floor by my friend and colleague, Mr. Morse, come in and do what they can to deprive the Government of the possession and use of its own property, which their Bethel has had for twenty years for nothing; although, as I believe, the Government had not then, and has not to-day, the right to appropriate, or loan, or give, the use of any Government reservation or property for the benefit of any religious sect.

I do not believe that constitutionally these people could hold the position they now occupy for a moment, and I am surprised that objection has never been raised before to their occupation of that property. So much as to the unconstitutionality of the amendment. The audacity of it is that these people, who have used this property of the United States in violation of the Constitution for twenty years, should now come in here and try to keep the Government from utilizing its own property for a site for an engine house, which is very much needed. I hope the amendment will be voted down.

MR. HULLUK. Is it proposed that the Government shall take this chapel building and destroy it without making any compensation?

MR. COOSWELL. Oh, no. It is a little wooden chapel placed on posts, which the Government does not propose to touch, but simply to ask these people to move off the ground.

MR. MORSE. They have no place to move it to.

A MEMBER. Let them buy a lot, then.

MR. HULLUK. I understand the gentleman from Massachusetts to say that it cost $4,600.

MR. MORSE. It did; and they have no other place to put it.

MR. BOWERS of California. Let them buy a lot, as the colored people do.

MR. HULLUK. I suppose very few members of this body know anything about that chapel, but they ought to go to church there some Sunday and find out. [Laughter.]

MR. LIVINGSTON. I want to ask the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Cogswell] whether we are not making in this bill very large appropriations for other denominational institutions?

MR. COOSWELL. In regard to that suggestion, which was made also by my colleague, I supposed that there was a difference between charity, which all religious sects cover with the mantle of their professions, and the recognition of a religious sect as such. My point is against recognizing any religious sect, which the Constitution expressly forbids.

MR. LIVINGSTON. And my point is that some of these institutions for which we appropriate are purely denominational institutions—nothing but that.

A MEMBER. What denomination is this Bethel?

MR. COOSWELL. Presbyterian.

MR. MORSE. It is nondenominational.

A MEMBER. I understood the gentleman himself to say that it belonged to the Presbyterian Church.

MR. COOSWELL. Now, Mr. Chairman, that Bethel ought not to stand there a minute longer. We have no right to let it be there, and never had.

MR. COMPTON. Mr. Chairman, I only want to remark, in addition to what the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Cogswell] has said, that if this amendment prevails it will entail an additional expense on the Government of perhaps $20,000. While the existing engine house in that district is absolutely out of condition for further use as an engine house, it can be given to this congregation and they can use it, at a comparatively small cost for repairs, as a meeting house, and I understand that the Commissioners are ready and willing to give them the use of the engine house for that purpose.

The question being taken on the amendment of Mr. Morse, the Chairman declared that the noes seemed to have it.

MR. MORSE. I ask for a division.

The committee divided; and there were—ayes 3, noes 60.

MR. MORSE. No quorum, Mr. Chairman.

THE CHAIRMAN. The point of no quorum being made, the Chair will appoint to act as tellers the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Compton] and the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Morse].

The committee divided, and the tellers reported—ayes 1—

MR. MORSE (pending the completion of the count by tellers). Mr. Chairman, I withdraw the point of no quorum. I move to strike out the last word of the paragraph, however, in order to say a word in regard to an understanding that I have with the gentleman in charge of this bill. I tried as hard as I could to hear what the gentleman from Maryland was saying awhile ago, but I was unable to do so. He now tells me that he stated that the Commissioners of the District of Columbia, since this matter has been agitated, have said that they would give this mission the use of the old engine house to repair and fix up for the purposes of their mission. With that understanding, and only about fifty gentlemen have voted, and there is undoubtedly no quorum in the city this afternoon, so that it would delay the public business to insist upon the point, I have withdrawn the point of no quorum; but I desire these remarks to go into the Record, and I will call the attention of the Commissioners of the District to this understanding, namely, that the Bethany Mission, conducted by the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church, is to have the old engine house to fix up to use for the purposes of their mission, such as they have conducted for the last twenty years.

In the Record of March 13, the subject is again continued:—

MR. MORSE. Mr. Speaker, I desire to correct the Record. On Saturday we passed the district appropriation bill containing an appropriation of $45,700 for charitable institutions, a part at least of which was for sectarian institutions, and in the same bill we wiped out one poor little Protestant mission chapel standing on Government land. I offered an amendment in relation to that chapel which was rejected, and the vote by which my amendment was rejected is not correctly stated in the Record, probably through inadvertence. On page 3680 appears the following:—

Mr. Morse. I ask for a division.
The committee divided, and there were—ayes 3, rows 60.

In fact, Mr. Speaker, there were 6 ayes that I saw, namely, Messrs. Grew, Springer, Blair, Hudson, Livingston, and Morse, and perhaps more I did not see. There was only about a third of a quorum present and three hundred members of the House were absent.

The Steuakin pro tempore. The correction will be made.

It is not until the next day that the matter receives its final quietus, when the matter of Mr. Morse's correction was called up and discussed at some length. This motion then prevailed:—

Mr. Starrett. I move to strike out the whole correction, inasmuch as it reflects on every member of this House, charging us with having voted an appropriation for sectarian purposes. I think for that reason the motion to strike out the whole correction should be agreed to.

This was what was finally done and the whole correction eliminated from the Record. But as will be seen by those who read these extracts, the discussion will serve to point several morals quite sharply.

These are some of the appropriations made:—

For the Church Orphanage Association of St. John's Parish, maintenance, $1,181.
For the German Orphan Asylum, maintenance, $1,181.
For the National Association for the Relief of Destitute Colored Women and Children, maintenance, including its care of colored foundlings, $7,680.
For St. Ann's Infant Asylum, maintenance, $3,840.
For St. Joseph's Asylum, maintenance, $1,181.
For the Association for Works of Mercy, maintenance, $1,181.
For House of Good Shepherd, maintenance, $4,773.
For the Industrial Home School, maintenance, $7,680.
For St. Rose's Industrial School, maintenance, $2,953.

Some of these names point their own moral. The sensitiveness to the accusation of appropriating for sectarian religious purposes, combined with the willingness to appropriate for charitable religion in general, is noticeable.

The shrewd attempt of Mr. Morse to advertise the names of those who voted with him, to his religious constituency, is also to be noted, as well as the determination on the part of others that this should not be done. Truly the "national irraggiant" is making very much the same progress in Congress that it is in the courts and municipal ordinances of the country at large.

There are two distinctively religious measures now before congressional committees, viz.: The religious amendment to the Constitution, and the Sunday law for the District of Columbia. It is understood that Mr. Blair, now in the House, will soon reintroduce his famous bill for a "national Sunday law."
