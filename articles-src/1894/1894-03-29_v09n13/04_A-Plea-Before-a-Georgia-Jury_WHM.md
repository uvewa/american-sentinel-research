The Roman Catholic Church claims to have attempted the change of the day of religious observance. Admissions in favor of truth from the ranks of its enemies constitute the highest kind of evidence,—therefore when Catholics themselves admit and declare their attempt to change the day, need we question their having done so? To support this Mr. McCutchen quoted from Roman Catholic publications,—"Catholic Catechism of Christian Religion," "Catholic Christian Instructed," "Abridgment of Christian Doctrine," and other authorities. He then proceeded substantially as follows:—

"This is sufficient to show who attempted the change of the day, and also the purpose of the Catholics in publishing this to the world—it is to show the inconsistency of Protestants. I hold in my hand a pamphlet of thirty-two pages on this Sabbath question, recently issued by the Catholic Mirrors of Baltimore, Md., the whole of which is taken up in showing that the Catholics did change the day, and challenging the Protestant world to show any scriptural authority for a change. Listen to the concluding paragraphs thrown out to the Protestants:—

The Protestant world at its birth found the Christian Sabbath too strongly entrenched to run counter to its existence; it was therefore placed under the necessity of acquiescing in the arrangement, thus implying the church's right to change the day, for over 300 years. The Christian Sabbath is therefore to this day the acknowledged offspring of the Catholic Church, as means of the Holy Ghost, without a word of remonstrance from the Protestant world.

Let us now, however, take a glance at our second proposition, with the Bible alone as the teacher and guide in faith and morals. This teacher most emphatically forbids any change in the day for permanent reasons. The command calls for a "perpetual command." The day commanded to be kept by the teacher has never once been kept, thereby developing an apostasy from an assumedly fixed principle, as self-contradictory, self-siditifying, and consequently as suicidal as it is within the power of language to express. Nor are the limits of demoralization yet reached. Far from it. Their pretense for leaving the bosom of the Catholic Church was for apostasy from the truth as taught in the written Word. They adopted the written Word as their sole teacher, which they had no sooner done than they abandoned it promptly as these articles have abundantly proved, and by a perversity as willful as erroneous, they accept the teaching of the Catholic Church in direct opposition to the plain, unvaried and constant teaching of their sole teacher in the most essential doctrine of their religion, thereby emphasizing the situation in what may be aptly designated "a mockery, a detusion, and a snare."

Should any of the reverend persons, who are habituated to howl so vociferously over every real or assumed desecration of that pious fraud, the Bible Subbath, think well of entering a protest against our logical and scriptural dissection of their mongrel pet, we can promise them that any reasonable attempt on their part to gather up the "disjects member" of the hybrid, and to restore to it a galvanized existence, will be met with genuine cordiality and respectful consideration on our part. But we can assure our readers that we know these reverend howlers too well to expect a solitary bark from them in this instance. And they know us too well to subject themselves to the mortification which a further dissection of this anti-scriptural question would necessarily entail. Their policy now is to "lay low," and they are sure to adopt it.

"Now, gentlemen of the jury, I don't know as it is necessary to give any further evidence along this line. The Bible shows no change whatever for the day. Historians show that human authority has changed it. It was over three hundred years this side of Christ before any authoritative change was made. Constantine, in 321 A. D., who himself did not even profess Christianity at that time, was the first to enact a law for Sunday observance.

"But there is another thing about this Sabbath question. In Ex. 31:12, 13 it is stated by the Lord that the Sabbath is 'a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you.' Verse 17 states the same thing. This point is made prominent throughout the Scriptures. See Ezek. 20:12, also verse 20, etc., etc.

"Our observance of the Sabbath is in conformity with the Scriptures and shows our allegiance to God who sanctifies. Notice the contrast. The Catholic Church has changed the day and correctly charges that professed Protestants are inconsistent in observing one of their festivals and not the rest. The change of the day is the sign the papacy presents to show its authority. One is the sign of the papacy which strives to change the law, and the other is the sign of God who made the law. Can you blame us, gentlemen of the jury, for obeying that which we regard as the sign of allegiance to the God to whom we profess allegiance? On the other hand if that is violated it will be recognizing the authority of the church, which would be irreligious and sacrilegious. That is the very same thing spoken of in the book of Revelation, chapter 14. Speaking of the beast, which all Protestant commentators agree, refers to the Roman Catholic power, it says, 'If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.' Verses 9 and 10.

"Gentlemen of the jury, if I with a knowledge of the facts before me and understanding the nature of the question, should acquiesce and obey that power, and keep the first day of the week as the Sabbath, to me it would be the mark of the beast in the forehead and in the hand; in the forehead by giving consent of my mind to it against my convictions, and in the hand by a cessation of labor with it in obedience to the mandates of the papacy. So, before the God of heaven and earth I take the liberty, in his name, to obey what the Lord himself has told me in his Word. To do otherwise would be to me to receive the mark of the beast spoken of in the book of Revelation. I have already read that this change of the Sabbath is the sign or mark of the Roman power. I say to you, if she herself claims it as the mark of her power, who can say it is not? There is a mark of allegiance to the true God. It is the Sabbath,—the sign of him who justifies and sanctifies. Now which shall I carry out?

"But, gentlemen of the jury, this is not merely a question of days, it is a question of rights and religious liberty. Even if Sunday were the Lord's day, the law has no constitutional right to enforce its observance upon any one. The Sabbath is a religious thing, whether it be called so or not. It is itself based on a religious principle. Can any one say that, because it is legislated upon, it is not connected with religious sentiments? Paganism observed Sunday as an institution in honor of the sun, which they recognized as their god. It is a religious institution all the way through, and the Constitution and laws of the United States cannot make it otherwise. It seems to me clearly that it is outside the civil government to undertake to enforce it upon any one. The law has no more right to enforce the right day than the wrong one upon the people. It would not be proper to enforce it upon us even if it were the right day. A man cannot acquiesce in legislation even in favor of his own religion without yielding up religious liberty. Religious liberty consists not merely in my contending for my right to worship as I please, but in my contending for the right of others to serve God as they think right. The whole tenor of Sunday legislation shows it to be religious legislation. This law is but the continuation of that enacted in 1762 on this question, when this State was a colony and the Church and State system was practically in vogue.

"The disposition of the fines imposed for Sunday work farther shows this to be religious legislation. The law provides that all such fines 'shall be paid to the ordinary of the county to be, by him, distributed for the purpose of establishing and promoting Sabbath-schools in the county.' Section 4501, Code of Georgia. Now notice, the fines collected for the violation of a supposed civil statute are to be appropriated for the purpose of carrying on religious instruction! Tell me, isn't that religious, in the beginning, and all the way through? Has the State any right to enact religious laws to enforce religious views upon any one? Let me refer here to the constitution of our State: 'All men have the natural and inalienable right to worship God each according to the dictates of his own conscience, and no human authority should, in any case, control or interfere with such rights of conscience.' Article 12, Bill of Rights. Now I ask you to think of that, 'All men have a natural and inalienable right.' What is an inalienable right? It is one that cannot be alienated; it is an inherent right. It inheres in its very nature in man; and this is to worship God according to the dictates of his conscience. I would also call your attention to paragraph 13, Bill of Rights:—

No inhabitant of this State shall be molested in person or property or prohibited from holding any public office or trust, on account of his religious opinion; but the right of liberty of conscience shall not be so construed as to excuse acts of licentiousness, or to justify practices inconsistent with the peace and safety of the State.

"Has there been any witness brought forward to show that there was anything done to menace the liberties of the citizens of this State? Has any one's life been in danger? No witness has testified to anything of that kind. The law says protection shall be impartial and complete. Every man has the inalienable right to carry out the dictates of his conscience. For what purpose have you read American history, in the face of such proceedings as are presented to us here?—A jury of twelve citizens called upon to infringe upon another's liberty?

"This principle is laid down in the Bible; every citizen is in duty bound to obey the laws of his country no matter how oppressive they may be until it comes in conflict with his duty to God and his law, in which case the law-makers will have entered upon religious legislation and exceeded their authority. There is a limit to civil authority itself. God has ordained governments, it is true. He has said to be subject to the powers that be. Some have taken a very strange view of this matter. Some have argued that the scripture (Romans 13:1) proves that we should submit to every law that may be enacted, even religious laws. But Romans 14, where it talks of matters of faith, says, 'Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.' Christ also says in Matt. 22:21: 'Render, therefore, unto Caesar [civil government] the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.'"

The address closed with an exceedingly effective plea for the personal and individual rights of the citizen, and with a moving presentation of the unjust character of such persecutions as this.
