## Old and New Style.

A CORRESPONDENT sends us the following, and requests some light on the subject:—

A gentleman here asserts that when we keep the seventh day, we do not know that that is the proper Sabbath, instituted by God, because "time changes;" for instance, he says: Washington was born February 11th, 1732, but on account of the change in time since that, his birthday had to be moved ahead to the 22nd of February, or, in other words, again in time, in one hundred and sixty-two years, of eleven days, consequently it does not matter what day we observe, because one can not be sure of observing the right one, any way.

Will the editor of the SENTINEL please give us some light on this subject, both as to Washington's birthday and the proper day of rest. Can we know that we have the right day when we observe the seventh?

Yours open to conviction.

The question is a very easy one. The year is a natural division of time measured off by the movement of the earth around the sun. It does not consist, however, of a certain number of days. The exact length of the solar year is 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 57 seconds.

The following, from "Analysis of Sacred Chronology," by S. Bliss, will make this matter clear:—

The year is the most convenient division of time. Previous to the deluge, and for a long time after, it was reckoned at three hundred and sixty days. As the sun returns annually to the same point in the heavens, it could not fail to be noticed as a natural measurement of time. The Egyptians attributed its discovery to the Phœnician, Hermes, a diligent observer of the rising and setting of the stars; but it was evidently in use before the deluge.

In process of time it was found that the primeval year of three hundred and sixty days was shorter than the tropical year, and five additional days were intercalated, to harmonize the observance of festivals with their appropriate seasons. It was subsequently found that the solar year exceeded three hundred and sixty-five days, by about six hours, or a quarter of a day.

In the time of Julius Caesar, owing to the irregularity with which the additional days had been intercalated, the vernal equinus, instead of falling on the 23rd of March, was dated near the middle of May. To remedy this, Caesar formed a preparatory year of fifteen months, or four hundred and forty-five days, called "the year of confusion." It began October 3, R. C. 46, so that the first reformed year following commenced January 1, R. C. 45. To compensate for the additional fraction of a day, he inserted a whole day every fourth year.

More accurate astronomical observations at length demonstrated that the true solar year was three hundred and sixty-five days, five hours, forty-eight minutes, and fifty-seven seconds—eleven minutes and three seconds less than the time reckoned, or one day in every one hundred and thirty years; so that in A. B. 1582 the vernal equinus was found to be on the 11th of March, having fallen back ten days. To remedy this, Pope Gregory XIII. left out ten days in October, calling the 5th the 15th of that month, making another "year of confusion." To prevent a repetition of this error, Gregory decreed that three days should be omitted in every four centuries, or that that number of years, which would otherwise be bissextile, should be reckoned as common years. This makes our year sufficiently exact for all practical purposes. Perfect accuracy, however, would require that another day be omitted in each six thousand years, and one day more at the end of one hundred and forty-four thousand.

The Gregorian calendar was not at once adopted, however, by all nations. The "Encyclopaedia Britannica," says:—

In Great Britain the alteration of the style was for a long time successfully opposed by popular prejudice. The inconvenience, however, of using a different date from that employed by the greater part of Europe, in matters of history and chronology, began to be generally felt; and at length, in 1751, an act of Parliament was passed for the adoption of the new style in all public and legal transactions. The difference of the two styles, which then amounted to eleven days, was removed by ordering the day following the second of September of the year 1752 to be accounted the 14th of that month; and in order to preserve uniformity in future, the Gregorian rule of intercalation respecting the secular years was adopted.

It will be seen that this change in the calendar had no effect whatever on the weekly cycle. Russia still adheres to the Julian calendar, but has the same week as the rest of the world. The reason for this is that the week has no connection whatever with the month or with the year. It is by divine appointment.

That the week is a definite and well-known division of time, and that consequently the seventh day of the week is likewise a well-defined portion of time, is attested by all history. Indeed, few other facts are so well attested, and no other arbitrary division of time is so ancient as is the weekly cycle. Moreover, the week is at once an unimpeachable witness to the truth of the Mosaic account of crepation, and an imperishable monument to the original Sabbath, the seventh day of the week.

Aside from the Bible, history furnishes no clue to the origin of the weekly cycle. Some have thought that it might have been suggested by the changes of the moon: but very unfortunately for that theory the moon does not change once in seven days but once in seven days and nine hours, as nearly as may be, hence its phases do not synchronize with the week. There is absolutely nothing in nature to suggest the septenary cycle; and so patent is this fact that the "Encyclopaedia Britannica," article "Calendar," says:—

As the week forms neither an aliquot part of the year nor of the lunar month, those who reject the Mosaic recital will be at a loss, as Delambre remarks, to assign to it an origin having much semblance of probability.

The same authority, article, "Babylonia," says:—

The week of seven days was in use from an early period; indeed, the names which we still give to the days can be traced to Ancient Babylonia; and the seventh day was one of solum, or rest.

This fact constitutes the week an unimpeachable witness to the truth of Genesis. But the question may be asked, How is it also an imperishable monument to the original Sabbath? The answer is easy. As the Sabbath of the fourth commandment is the seventh day of the week it can not be lost as long as the weekly cycle endures; and that it never has been lost, is attested by the fact that the week has always been known among almost all nations.

Rev. Thos. Hamilton, A. M., of Belfast, in his prize essay, "Our Rest," published by the Sabbath Alliance of Scotland, testifies that even the Chinese formerly had, not only the septenary division of days, but that they knew and to some extent observed the original Sabbath. Seventy-five out of one hundred and seven ancient languages, reveal a knowledge not only of the weekly cycle but of the Sabbath, the last day of that cycle. On this subject Rev. Dr. Lewis has eloquently said:—

The nations that spoke many of these languages have long since gone from the earth. But the words of their mother tongue embalm their thoughts and practices as inoffacable and unmistakable monuments showing the identity of the week and of the Sabbath. Tides of emigration have swept hither and thither over the earth. Empires have risen, flourished, and fallen, but the week has endured, amid all convulsions and changes. Philology has done for the truth concerning God's eternal Sabbath, what cuneiform inscriptions, and mummy pits, are doing for general and national history.

All of which facts support the statement, that the week is an imperishable monument to the true Sabbath.

That the week has not been lost this side of the Christian era need not even be asserted, in view of the facts already given. Even the tyro in history knows that such a thing would have been impossible. It follows, that unless we find in the Bible authority for keeping as the Sabbath a day other than the seventh day of the week, as we now have it, the claim that Sunday is the Sabbath utterly fails for want of even an excuse for ever having had an existence.
