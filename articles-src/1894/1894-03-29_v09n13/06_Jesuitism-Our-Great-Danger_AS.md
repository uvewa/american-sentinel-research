The society of Jesuits, one of the most celebrated orders of the Roman Catholic Church, was founded by Ignatius Loyola in 1540. The reigning pope, Paul III., immediately by his bull, sanctioned the institution. The following is a copy of the Jesuit oath:—

I, A. B., now in the presence of Almighty God, the blessed Virgin Mary, the blessed Michael the archangel, the blessed St. John the Baptist, the holy apostle the St. Peter and St. Paul, and the saints and the sacred host of heaven, and to you my ghostly father, do declare from my heart, without mental reservation, that his holiness pope —— is Christ's Vicar-General, and is the true and only head of the Catholic or Universal Church throughout the earth; and that by the virtue of the keys of binding and lossing given to his holiness by Jesus Christ, he hath power to depose heretical kings, princes, States, commonwealth, and governments, all being illegal without his sacred confirmation, and that they may safely be destroyed; therefore, to the utmost of my power, I shall and will defend this doctrine and his holiness' rights and customs against all usurpers of the heretical or Protestant authority whatsoever, especially against the new pretended authority and Church of England, and all adherents, in regard that they and she be usurpal and heretical, opposing the sacred mother church of Rome. I do renounce and discover my allegiance as due to any heretical king, prince, or State, named Protestants, or obedience to any of their inferior magistrates or officers. I do further declare the doctrine of the Church of England of the Calvinists, Huguenots, and other Protestants, to be damnable, and those to be damned who will not forsake the same. I do further declare, that I will help, assist, and advise all, or any of his holiness agents in any place wherever I shall be; and do my utmost to extirpate the heretical Protestants' doctrines, and to destroy all their pretended powers, regal or otherwise. I do further promise and declare, that notwithstanding I am dispensed to assume any religion heretical, for the propagation of the mother church's interest, to keep secret and private all her agents' counsels, as they entrust me, and not to divulge, directly or indirectly, by word, writing or circumstances whatsoever, but shall execute all which shall be proposed, given in charge, or discovered onto me, by you my ghostly father, or by any of this sacred convent. All which, I, A. B., do swear by the blessed Trinity and blessed sacrament, which I am now to receive, to perform and on my part to keep inviolably; and do call all the heavenly and glorious host of heaven to witness these my real intentions to keep this my oath. In testimony whereof, I take this most holy and blessed sacrament of the Encharist, and witness the same further with my hand and seal, in the face of this holy covenant, this —— day —— An. Dom., etc.—Papal Rome As B Is, pp. 223-225.

It will be seen that these minions of the papacy are the sworn enemies of every government on earth save that of the pope only; and that to effect the objects of their order they will not hesitate to profess any Protestant or heathen faith under the sun. They will obtrude themselves into public schools as teachers; and upon the rostrum as lecturers, and preachers, assuming for the occasion a sacerdotal or citizen's garb.

Says the "Religious Encyclopaedia":—

Their Christianity, chamelson-like, readily assumed the color of every religion where it happened to be introduced. They freely permitted their converts to retain a full proportion of the old superstitions, and suppressed, without hesitation, any point in the new faith which was likely to bear hard on their prejudices or propensities. They proceeded to still greater lengths; and besides suppressing the truths of revelation, devised the most absurd falsehoods, to be used for attracting disciples, or even to be taught as parts of Christianity. One of them in India produced a pedigree to prove his own descent from Brahma; and another in America assured a native chief that Christ had been a valiant and victorious warrior, who, in the space of three years, had scalped an incredible number of men, women and children.—P. 669.

Says Giustiniani, who was a convert from Jesuitism:—

He is a monarchist in Austria, a revolutionist in France, an autocrat in Italy, and a republican in the United States.—Papal Rome As B Is, p. 219.

In Rome they are not only the chief counselors of every project, but the executors of every plan framed by the secret council of the Vatican.—Id., p. 218.

The United States is the fruitful field of the Jesuits. Already they control all the principal cities of the country. They have also organized many Roman Catholic military societies, ostensibly as United States militia, and they are officered by some of the most skillful generals of the country.

And what constitutes the greatest source of danger to the country is that Protestants look upon the growing power of the papacy with stolid indifference. Says Chiniquy:—

The Americans, with few exceptions, do not pay any attention to the dark cloud which is rising at their horizon, from Rome. Though that cloud is filled with rivers of tears and blood, they let it grow and rise without even caring how they will escape from the impending hurricane.—Fifty Years in Rome, p. 671.

There will be an awakening in this country by and by, but it will come too late to save the nation. Only the few who are forewarned will escape the fearful consequences of the general disregard of Jesuitical intrigue.
