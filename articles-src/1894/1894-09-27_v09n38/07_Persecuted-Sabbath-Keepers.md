The Christian Reformer and Dissenter for August 25th, makes a labored effort to defend the wrongs which are being done to Sabbath-keepers by the partisan and unchristian enforcement of Sunday law in Maryland, Georgia and Tennessee. The position of our contemporary is this: The Government must have a Sabbath, a civil institution. The people must be compelled to keep the Sabbath which the Government institutes. This position is Judaistic theocracy, and pagan State churchism, combined. It is not the doctrine of the New Testament, nor of the New Testament Christianity. The real animus of the Reformer's position is found in the arrogance of majorities. It is practically this:—

1. Resolved, That the world belongs to the saints.
2. Resolved, That we are the saints.
3. Resolved, That foolish minorities of "less than one-eighth of one per cent." must be subject to the saints.

Attest the following paragraph from the Reformer:—

It is evident that the Sabbath observed by the Government must be the one observed by the people. Otherwise there will be conflict. Starting with the idea that the people have a divine right to a Sabbath, it follows that the State will regard as the Sabbath the day which the people regard. We do not now intend to discuss the claims of either the first or the seventh day of the week to recognition as the Sabbath. We maintain, however, that the first day of the week is now the Sabbath, not by the decree of Constantine or of the Roman Catholic Church, but by the decree of God. This is the day observed by the vast majority of the people. Those who observe the seventh day, including Jews, Seventh-day Baptists, and Seventh-day Adventists, are less than one-eighth of one per cent. of the entire population.

This is the polished but not less genuine doctrine of despots and bullies, everywhere, as the closing paragraphs of the Reformer's editorial further show. These read as follows:—

(1.) The State must have a Sabbath.
(2.) That Sabbath must be the day observed by the people.
(3.) It must be protected by law.
(4.) Our Sabbath laws, either by specific enactment or by judicial decision, guard the rights of those who keep another day.
(5.) Those who plant themselves on Old Testament usage, without regard to the change made at the resurrection of Christ, and who trample on statute laws protecting the first day as the Sabbath, and thereby undest others, and interfere with their rights to rest and worship and also interfere with the rights of the State, must be dealt with as polygamists or others who make their religion a shield for violation of law. We would like to see a beginning made, however, in enforcing the law against railroad, steamboat, and street car companies, and newspapers issued on the Sabbath, and the saloon that is open on that day. These are the great enemies of religion and the chief promoters of disorder and immorality.

The position of this Reformer who thus insults Sabbath-keeping Christians and Jews by classing them with "polygamists," and defends their persecution, is worthy of no date this side of the Dark Ages. Reduced to its lowest terms, we have this—

(1.) This great, good, pious Christian nation—see our late Congress, for example—empowered by Jehovah to make laws touching religion, has decreed that Sunday is the Sabbath, hence all people must keep it holy.
(2.) But this pious Christian nation wickedly breaks its own laws in countless ways. It carries on business, and runs its mail trains; its pious congressmen hold important committee meetings on its own sacred day. It is the leader in lawlessness. All strong corporations follow its example. The great newspapers, and those promoters of good order and religion, known as saloons, are very attentive to the advantages which the enforced idleness of the masses offer to their never-ceasing business.
(3.) Our reforming contemporary "would like to see a beginning made," etc. That might be well. Lawmakers ought to obey their own laws. But since the Government will not obey its own laws, since it is accustomed to grant to itself and all strong corporations and newspapers, etc., a "dispensation," to be as lawless as the circumstances may demand; and since the Jews and Sabbath-keeping Christians are a "one-eighth" minority, a mere trifle compared with the saints so whom the ends of the earth belong; and since Sunday work in a back lot, by a Seventh-day Adventist, in Georgia is a terrible menace to the morals and good order of the nation; since the selling of shoe-strings by a poor Jew in New York or Philadelphia might corrupt the morals of a weak congressman like Breckinridge, of Kentucky; and since, therefore, Resolved, that all "Saturdarians" shall be compelled to obey the righteous decrees of this Christian nation touching the sacred American Sabbath, or pay a fine or go to jail, or to the "chain gang." And the Reformer, who virtually says all this, wants God put into the Constitution of the nation, in order to get a better basis for enforcing Sunday laws!! We suggest, respectfully, that the Christian Reformer and Dissenter (Pittsburg) invite Christ to its editorial rooms that it may learn from him something of Christian charity and the meaning of religious liberty.—Evangel and Sabbath Outlook.
