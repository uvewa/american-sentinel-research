IONIA, Mich., Sept. 5.—Ionia has a law and order league which is alive to the interests of Sunday observance, and through its influence the common council at last night's meeting passed an ordinance forbidding the opening of all places of business on the first day of the week, after October 1.

It makes it the duty of the marshal to see that the law is enforced, and empowers him to shut up all places working or doing business, and to arrest such persons without due process of law. If such an ordinance is enforced, and the marshal declares it his intention to do so, Ionia will be a veritable paradise for lovers of a quiet time.—Detroit Free Press, Sept. 7, 1894.
