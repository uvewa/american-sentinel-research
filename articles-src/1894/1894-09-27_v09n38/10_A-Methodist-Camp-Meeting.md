LANCASTER CAMP GROUNDS, August 13. —As the skirmish is to the general engagement, so the work of last week has simply been a "feeler" to the great battle that will be waged this week. To-day every Christian member of this camp is hustling and making ready for the fight that is before him.

Everybody that heard Rev. N. H. Lathrop at the 10 a. m. meeting at the auditorium, pronounced it one of the most refreshing showers of gospel rainfall that we have had. His theme was the millennium and in his version of the great revelation of St. John, the divine opened up new thoughts and new studies in this old field that will last longer than the camp meeting of 1894.

In talking of the improvement and difference of worship of the old Romans and that of the Roman Church of to-day, he said: "God bless the Catholic Church of to-day," and further said, "I believe that the time will come when the Catholic Church will wheel into the same line with the Protestant churches." He strongly commended the action of Bishop Watterson in taking his manly and Christian stand in the temperance cause, and said: "God bless Bishop Watterson!" A hearty amen came from the lips and hearts of more than one hundred ministers and multiplied hundreds of listeners.—Ohio State Journal, August 14.
