[Of the return of Dr. Burtsell to this country from Rome, the Tribune, of the 3rd. inst., says:—]

He has been appointed agent for the United States of the Society for the Propagation of the Encyclical Rerum Novarum, for the proclamation of that body with his name attached has preceded him. His appointment as the agent of this society is considered by his friends to be a great honor.

The Society for the Propagation of the Encyclical Rerum Novarm, of which little or nothing is known in this country, has for its object the promulgation and fostering of the principles of the encyclical of the pope on the labor question two years ago. It is one of special interest to the pope, and its president is Cardinal L. M. Parocchi, Vicar-General of the pope. Following is a copy of the proclamation, which will be distributed in every diocese for information concerning the workingmen's organizations in the United States:

Important to workingmen's societies. Society for the Propagation of the Encyclical Rerum Novarum. His Eminence Cardinal L. M. Parocchi, Hon. President.

The committee has in hand the compilation of a collection of written opinions on the Encyclical (Rerum Novarum) and on its practical application. Until now, all the crowned heads of Europe, the episcopacy, and the most celebrated men of social science have contributed to the work; and we are able to state that this demonstration of sympathy with his far-seeing views, has gladdened the heart of Leo XIII. If by chance you have not taken part, we beg you to regard yourself as earnestly invited by this similar to do so at your earliest convenience. At this moment, moreover, the same committee is engaged in the compilation of statistics of all the practical works for the benefit of the working classes which have either been called into existence by the words of the Supreme Pontiff, or have brought themselves into conformity with the lines of action traced out in the encyclical. Hence, the committee earnestly begs you to second it in this undertaking by kindly writing answers to the questions here enclosed.

Then follows a blank form containing these questions, the answers to which are to be appended:—

Number, names and location of workingmen's societies, date of foundation, number of members. What percentage of total number of workingmen belong to the societies? By whom are they managed? Are there workingmen's banks? What is the capital of each? Has the encyclical produced an effect upon these societies?

The document closes with a space for the signature and residence of the sender, with the direction to forward to the Rev. Dr. Richard L. Burtsell, Rondout, New York. It was said that this commission, which has been given to Dr. Burtsell at the instance of the pope, may have some influence in hastening his return, for it is likely that the desired statistics should be prepared and transmitted as soon as possible.
