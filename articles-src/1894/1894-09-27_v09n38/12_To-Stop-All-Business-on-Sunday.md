SAGINAW, Mich., Sept. 10.—Special Telegram.—The Saginaw Liquor Dealers' Association will endeavor to close up all sorts of business places on Sunday next. The saloon-keepers are not allowed to do business on that day, and they propose to see that no one else does. They will protest against the running of the street cars and sale of cigars, newspapers, soda water, etc. The association insisted upon the members keeping their places closed on Sunday, and all complied but three or four. It is proposed to close every place up as tight as a drum.—Inter-Ocean, Sept. 11.
