As generally anticipated, the Prussian Federal Council has refused to sanction the bill allowing the return of the Jesuits, which was passed by the Reichstag. But it allows some Catholic orders, like Redemptorists and others, to return. This restoration costs the government a large amount withheld from the Catholic prelates and priests during the Kulturkampf, because they refused to accept the May or Falck laws. The government has paid back to them nearly 14,000,000 marks, and over 2,000,000 marks to other higher Roman officials. These immense sums are now being used by the Roman Church in Germany for the support of their poor congregations, the erection of new churches, and the support of superannuated clergymen. These facts show what it costs the State to maintain religious establishments.

The Romanists, however, will not cease their efforts to secure the return of the Jesuits, and as the Protestants are divided by dogmatic quarrels among themselves, it is feared that they will succeed. It would be an unspeakable humiliation if Germany would again "go to Conossa," notwithstanding Bismarck's famous declaration to the contrary.—The Lutheran Observer.
