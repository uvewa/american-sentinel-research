KANSAS CITY, Mo., Sept. 10.—At least a thousand people, representing three law and order leagues and twenty-nine churches, of this city, called at the city hall this afternoon, and, through their spokesman, Thomas Jones, President of the Missouri Christian Endeavor Society, made a demand on the police board to enforce the law relative to the closing of saloons on Sunday. The members of the police board were taken by surprise, but Mayor Davis responded to the demands of the people by promising to have the law enforced.—Chicago Herald, Sept. 11.
