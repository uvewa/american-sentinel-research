THE session of the German Roman Catholic Central Verein was concluded yesterday at the school hall of the Most Holy Redeemer, at 222 East Fourth Street. . . . In the afternoon the resolutions of the convention were adopted. The following reference was made to the A. P. A.:—

"The fruits of religious hatred and fanaticism, which of late years the secret societies have brought forth by endeavoring, under the mask of patriotism or Americanism, to ostracize Catholics, must spur our Catholic societies to join forces for the purpose of defending and preserving our religious as well as our civil rights. . . . In such societies our men, young and old, will learn, above all, how to face the arrogance, nay, impudence, of resuscitated Know-Nothingism. Our Catholic societies are by no means political societies; every one of their members is at full liberty to side with either political party, and yet our religious conviction, and solely this, will decide our choice in all those cases in which a party or individuals see fit to drag religion into politics and to become the tool of cliques, as un-American as they are un-Catholic."—New York Sun, Sept. 20.
