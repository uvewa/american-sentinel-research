The and again it has been shown from the mouths of Catholics themselves that the Sunday institution is the badge, mark, or sign of the authority and power of the Roman Catholic Church. It has likewise been shown that the leading representatives of so-called Protestantism acknowledge Sunday to be the test, mark, or sign of that religious system. This is particularly true of the United States. The representatives of popular religious thought call Sunday "the test of all religion," "the corner-stone of Christ's kingdom," "the sign of the Christian nation," "a mark of American religion," etc., etc. It is worth while, then, to inquire what the Sunday institution really represents.

As the papacy is set forth in the Scriptures under the symbol of a "beast" (Rev. 13:1-10), its mark is usually called "the mark of the beast." See Rev. 19: 20; 13:16, 17; 14:9; 15:2. There is a slight variation, however, in Rev. 14:11. Here the "mark of the beast" is called "the mark of his name." Sunday, then, is that which represents the name of the beast. What name is here referred to? This is explained in the thirteenth chapter, verses 17, 18: "And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred threescore and six." Here the name of the beast is declared to have a "number," and that number "is the number of a man." This proves that the "beast" and the "man" are practically the same thing. In other words, the beast is a one-man power, and is represented by that one man.

Now every one knows that this is true to the very letter of the papacy, all the power of which is exercised and controlled by the pope. It is the pope who speaks to the church and speaks for the church. In him centers everything pertaining to the church.

Does the pope bear the number six hundred threescore and six? He does. Upon his pontifical crown may be seen in jewelled letters this title: "Vicarius Filii Dei," "Vicegerent of the Son of God." Taking the letters of this title, used as Roman numerals, in their regular order, their value is just six hundred and sixty-six. The letters A, R, S, F, and E are not used as numerals. The letter U was originally made like V, and represented five. Arranging the letters used as numerals in a vertical column with their equivalent values, we have this:—

|  V | 5  |
| --- | --- |
|  I | 1  |
|  C | 100  |
|  I | 1  |
|  U (V) | 5  |
|  I | 1  |
|  L | 50  |
|  I | 1  |
|  I | 1  |
|  D | 500  |
|  I | 1  |
|  1000  |

By this it is proven that the name which has the number, is "Vicarius Filii Dei," or "Vicegerent of the Son of God." And Sunday, as a religious institution, is the mark of this name. Those who receive the mark receive the name with all that it implies. And what does this name imply? What is the meaning of it? It means that the pope stands in the place of the Son of God as the saviour of men. It means that he holds in his hands the keys of the kingdom of God, so that he can grant or refuse an entrance to whomsoever he will. It means that "the pope has power to change times, to abrogate laws, and to dispense with all things, even the precepts of Christ." It means that the power he possesses and exercises is the power of God.

All this and much more is acknowledged by the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week. Those who observe the papal Sabbath, instead of God's Sabbath, thereby acknowledge that the pope had the right to put himself in the place of God and to substitute his law for the law of God. And in this they acknowledge that his title, "Vicarius Filii Dei," is a proper one, and that they accept him as their saviour, rendering to him homage which would otherwise belong to God.

It is strange that so few realize the enormous sin which is committed to recognizing the rightfulness of this blasphemous title. To admit that the pope stands in the place of the Son of God, is to admit that he exercises the authority and power of the Son of God. But the Bible says, "The dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority." Rev. 13:3. The Scripture also says that the dragon is the devil. Rev. 12:5. It is therefore true that all the power which the papacy possesses came directly from the devil. The power of the Catholic Church is the power of the devil, and not the power of God. And those who observe Sunday, knowing its origin and authority, thereby assert, though it be unwittingly, that the power of the devil is the power of God.

Of the second beast of Rev. 13, which represents the United States of America, it is said, that "he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him." Then this nation will exercise the power of the devil, too, will it not? This power is to be exercised in influencing and compelling the people to worship the papacy and its image. Rev. 13:12-15. And they are to worship the papacy by receiving its mark, the papal Sunday. Verses 16, 17. Catholics are pleased with the prospect. They say:—

The observance of Sunday by Protestants is an homage [worship] they pay, in spite of themselves, to the authority of the [Catholic] church.—Plain Talk for Protestants, p. 212.

Again:—

The church changed the Sabbath to Sunday, and all the world bows down and worships upon that day in silent obedience to the mandates of the Catholic Church.—From a lecture by Father Enright, 1884.

This quotation agrees pretty well with Rev. 13:8: "And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life."

All except God's people will assert that the power of the papacy, which changed the Sabbath, is the power of God. When the Pharisees called the power of God the power of the devil, they were charged with blasphemy. Are not men guilty of the same offense when they assert that the power of the devil, exercised by the Catholic Church, is the power of God? And is not that equivalent to saying that the devil is God, and that his worship is the worship of God?
