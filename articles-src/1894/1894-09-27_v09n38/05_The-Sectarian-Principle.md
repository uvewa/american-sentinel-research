The contest in the State Constitutional Convention at Albany over the principle of no sectarian appropriations has been a very interesting one. When the convention met, the National League for the Protection of American Institutions submitted a form of amendment designed to assert this principle and prevent its violation. The amendment had been subjected to the scrutiny of some of the ablest lawyers in the State, and they had given it their approval. It proposed, first, in the words of the first article of the Constitution of the United States, that no law should be passed respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; second, that neither the property, funds nor credit of the State nor of any civil division thereof shall be used, directly or indirectly, for the maintenance of any church, religious denomination or religious society; third, that no institution, society or undertaking in whole or in part under sectarian or ecclesiastical control shall receive such aid.

This is a sweeping amendment. It would cut off not only all churches, but all denominational schools, even such as might be put under State control, all denominational institutions for secondary instruction, such as academies, institutes and seminaries, and all charitable institutions under denominational direction, from receiving any money from State, county or municipal treasuries. This is just what ought to be accomplished. It means complete separation of Church and State, and that, and that only, will settle the sectarian question.

The proposed amendment was divided. The first clause, we understand, is to go into the preamble to the constitution; the question of appropriations to schools was referred to the Committee on Education, and that relating to charitable institutions to the Committee on Charities. The Committee on Education gave hearings to both sides, and was so impressed with the general demand for a constitutional prohibition of sectarian appropriations, that it reported the amendment almost unchanged, and supported it with this strong recommendation:—

In the opinion of the committee there is no demand from the people of the State upon the convention so unmistakable, widespread and urgent; none, moreover, so well grounded in right and reason as that the public school system of the State shall be forever protected by constitutional safeguards from all sectarian influence or interference; and that public money shall not be used, directly or indirectly, to propagate denominational tenets or doctrines. We have sought to give the clearest and strongest expression possible to these principles in the proposed section. The arguments in favor of such a provision are, in our opinion, conclusive: and the objection that it will result in making the schools "Godless," or that such a constitutional prohibition would imply upon the part of the people enacting it hostility or even indifference to religion, seems to us to be both groundless and absurd. In adopting this section the convention will, in our opinion, most effectively aid all that is highest and best in religion; for, by establishing the principle that State education must necessarily be secular in its character, the field is left open, beyond question or misunderstanding, for religious teaching in the family, the Sunday school and the Church.

This splendid paragraph gave the unbiased judgment of the committee, and it gives with equal accuracy the judgment of the great mass of the people of the State. But large denominational interests would be affected by the cutting off of all educational institutions under sectarian control, and these interests made themselves felt in one way and another; and the committee subsequently reported the following amendment, to be added to the section:—

This section shall not apply to schools in institutions subject to visitation and inspection by the State Board of Charities.

The effect of this would be to open the door which the section originally reported would effectually close. The friends of the non-sectarian principle were amazed that the committee should so stultify itself, and they rallied against the amendment, and, with the assistance of President Choate, defeated it.

Other amendments of the same tenor were proposed, however, in committee of the whole, and defeated one after another, but by a very small margin in some instances. The most specious of them all was offered by a Protestant, a member of a denomination which occupies the highest ground on the question of separation of Church and State. He proposed a substitute limiting the use of public moneys to schools or institutions wholly owned or controlled by the State or minor civil division. This was a shrewd device to secure the continuance of State aid to denominational academies and seminaries, which are under the control of the State Regents and of such parochial schools as have been or may be turned over to the State, and it was actually carried in committee of the whole. President Choate, in the convention, characterized it as meaning "local option for the rankest sectarianism," but such was the hold which the denominational interests, Protestant, Catholic and Jewish, had secured on the convention, that it was barely defeated by a vote of 71 to 68.

The amendment, as it now stands, is sound and good; but it has not been finally adopted. Nothing could show more forcibly how deeply the poison of sectarianism has sunk into the system of the State than the unseemly struggle which has been made in its behalf in the Constitutional Convention. Men too intelligent to deny the correctness of the principle in the abstract set themselves to secure opportunity to evade and violate it in practice. A Baptist or Methodist academy that has been receiving a few hundred dollars a year, clings to the subvention and hates to have it cut off, and the politicians become eloquent pleaders for Catholic and Jewish institutions because of the promise it gives them of votes. Sectarian interests, therefore, may possibly defeat the educational amendment, or they may allow it to pass with the expectation of getting a concession when the Charities Amendment is acted on.

It is regarded as settled that private charitable institutions will not be cut off. The Committee on Charities proposes to report a paragraph of this tenor:—

Nothing shall prevent the payment of money by the State or any civil division thereof to the institutions mentioned and made subject to the visitation and inspection of the State Board of Charities, for the care, support, maintenance and education other than religious instruction of inmates received and retained therein, pursuant to law and to rules established by said board. Such rules shall be subject to the control of the legislature.

This would so far vitiate the educational amendment as to allow the State to support schools in sectarian charitable institutions. It is a pity, when the demand of the people is "so unmistakable, widespread and urgent" for constitutional safeguards against sectarian appropriations, that the convention should fail to meet it. The circumstances of its failure to do so afford one of the strongest arguments for the final and complete separation of Church and State. If the educational amendment is submitted one step in this direction will have been taken, and the campaign of education must go on until the last tie is cut and all denominational institutions are left entirely to their own resources.—The Independent, Sept. 13.
