It may have escaped the attention of our readers that the Indian Appropriation bill passed by the last Congress received an amendment directing the Secretary of the Interior to inquire into the propriety of discontinuing contract schools, and the effect of such action on the education of Indian children; and "to submit to Congress at the next session the result of such investigation, including an estimate of the additional cost, if any, of substituting Government schools for contract schools, together with such recommendations as he may deem proper." It is, of course, generally understood that "contract schools" are schools established and carried on by various religious denominations, and receiving from the Government a stipulated payment for each child under their charge. The facts which led to the offering and adoption of this amendment are, briefly, that out of the total amount of $525,881 appropriated to denominational schools last year, one denomination, the Roman Catholic, received $369,235; while all the others together, fifteen in number, got only about $156,000.

There is already a gathering storm in this country against this matter of appropriating money for sectarian purposes. The principle is wrong. It will have to be reversed sooner or later, and, in my opinion, the sooner it is done the better it will be for the rights and the liberties of the American people." —Examiner, Sept. 6, 1894.
