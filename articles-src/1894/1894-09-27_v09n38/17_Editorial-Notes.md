Any one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.

If the gentleman writing to us from South Monterey, Mich., under date of September 4, about the Capps case, will send us his name, instead of simply his initials, we will reply to his letter.

It is stated that the pope would like to interfere in the Corean difficulty, but cannot see his way clear to do so without offending one or other of the great powers. Leo XIII. certainly has a wonderful itching to arbitrate something.

The facts stated under "Significant Paragraphs," in regard to Dr. Burtsell's commission to collect statistics, are directly in line with the statement made in these columns some weeks since to the effect that the papacy is scheming to insinuate itself into the labor question in such a way as to become the arbitrator, not only of disputes between labor and capital, but between labor and the civil authorities. The pope's interest in the United States is not disinterested benevolence by any means. Rome means to dominate the United States, and she sees in the unrest of the masses an opportunity to make it appear that she is quite necessary to the stability of the Republic.

We begin this week the publication of several articles on papal infallibility. We find for them a careful reading. Of course infallibility does not attach to the pope in any way, except in the minds of his votaries. It is altogether a vanishing quantity. It is claimed that it inheres only in a certain prerogative of the office of pope, namely, in ex cathedra utterances; and to this term the Vatican council of 1870 affixed such a definition that almost any utterance, on almost any subject, may be held to be ex cathedra or not ex cathedra, at the sweet will of the pope himself, or of those who are affected by the utterance. This is of course to leave a loophole by which to escape from the many glaring errors, to say nothing of the downright wickedness of many of the popes of Rome. That which part of the church accepts as ex cathedra may be denied by another part; or that which one pope has spoken "from the chair of St. Peter," as he supposed and intended, may by another pope be ignored, or set down as simply an opinion on canon law or a deliverance on discipline. Three inquiries have recently been made from this office of as many high Roman Catholic officials in this country concerning ex cathedra utterances by the present pope. One of these officials (the highest in rank in the United States) replied: "It is not very often that the popes are obliged to speak in such a manner [ex cathedra]; but they have done so in many instances, as did Leo XIII. on a recent occasion." When asked what the recent occasion was, and where an authentic copy of the utterance could be obtained, "the prince of the church" twice evaded the question. One archbishop and another archbishop's chancellor replied that they had no knowledge of an ex cathedra utterance by the present pope. It is therefore evident that the pope's infallibility is altogether chimerical, derived from an imaginary function of a man-made office, from the will of the "sovereign pontiff," and dependant upon the interpretation of those to whom it is addressed. This is papal infallibility, and it is to faith in this that Leo XIII. invites "the rulers and peoples of the universe."

One of the most significant of our "Significant Paragraphs," this week, is that in which it is related that a Methodist preacher, in Ohio, exclaimed at a recent camp meeting: "God bless the Roman Catholic Church of to-day."

"Rome never changes." The Roman Catholic Church of to-day is, according to her own boast, the Roman Catholic Church of the Middle Ages. Cardinal Gibbons says, in "The Faith of Our Fathers," page 71:—

Perpetuity, or duration till the end of time, is one of the most striking marks of the Church. By perpetuity is not meant merely that Christianity in one form or another was always to exist, but that the Church was to remain forever in its integrity, clothed with all the attributes which God gave it in the beginning. For, if the Church lost any of her essential characteristics, . . . she could not be said to be perpetual, because she would not be the same institution.

Again, on page 83 of the same book, we find these words:—

Amid the continual changes in human institutions, she [the Roman Catholic Church] is the one institution that never changes. . . . She has seen monarchies changed into republics, and republics consolidated into empires—all this has she witnessed, while her own divine constitution has remained unaltered.

That Rome adapts herself in some measure to different ages is true; but that she changes in character is not true. Her doctrines, her purposes are the same now as in the Middle Ages, and if she could she would push back the car of human progress to the position it occupied when she dominated the civilized world, and the Inquisition tortured its victims and hunted its enemies where it would. Says Brownson, a Roman Catholic writer, whose work is on sale in all Catholic book stores: "Always will the period from the sixth to the end of the fifteenth century stand out as most glorious in the annals of the race."—Liberalism and the Church, page 182.

No, "Rome never changes," and she is sorry that the world has changed. She is sorry that there was ever such an era as that of the Reformation. She is much grieved at the existence of the various Protestant sects, of which the Methodist Episcopal Church is one. And yet a Methodist preacher says, "God bless the Roman Catholic Church of to-day." If Rome is the Church of God, there is no excuse for Methodism; its inception was wickedness, its continuance is presumption. But if Rome is, as the Scriptures characterize her, "the mystery of iniquity," "the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth," how dare any man bearing the name of Protestant, bid her God speed?

Another case of persecution for conscience' sake is reported from Australia. An Adventist was arrested for Sunday work in Parramatta, a suburb of Sydney, early in August, and was fined two shillings and sixpence, or to be set in the stocks for two hours. The fine not being paid and there being no stocks, orders were given to erect some. But the Minister of Justice did not relish a return to mediavalism, and finding that the statute of Charles II. provided a fine of five shillings instead of two shillings and sixpence, he took advantage of the technicality and ordered proceedings to be stopped and the prisoner to be set free. The Adventists embraced the opportunity to circulate their literature and their work has been advanced rather than hindered by the arrest.

In another column we print an article from the Independent touching the question of State appropriation to religious or semi-religious institutions, as viewed by the Constitutional Convention of this State. We publish the matter because of its statement of facts, but do not indorse the action of the convention; because it prohibits appropriations only to institutions "under control or direction of religious denominations or in which any denominational tenet or doctrine is taught." It leaves the door wide open for appropriations to institutions claiming to teach undenominational tenets.

It is now positively stated that Mgr. Satolli will not be recalled by the pope, but that he will presently be formally appointed supreme head of "the church" in this country.
