OUR attention has recently been called to a statement made in these columns September 14, 1893, to the effect that "the Methodist, the Episcopalian, the Congregationalist, and the Baptist churches" had "all refused to take any more" money from the Government for the support of their Indian schools. The statement is made that "the Baptists never received any public money for Indian schools, or for any other purpose, and could not, therefore, have refused to take any more."

As soon as our statement that the Baptists had refused to accept further State aid was challenged, we began to make inquiries to learn the exact truth of the matter. To this end we asked Mr. Allen Moon, president of the International Religious Liberty Association, a resident of Washington, to ascertain the facts for us. He subsequently wrote thus, under date of September 11:—

I have spent considerable time at the office of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and have looked up the record of the Indian Contract Schools so far back as 1887, and there is no record of any Baptist school in the United States having received any money from the Government, while the Catholics, Episcopalians, Lutherans, Methodists, Presbyterian, Mennonites, Quakers, and others have had such appropriations from the Government. I am inclined to think your statement is a mistake, so far as the Baptists are concerned; but you need not make any retraction on this authority. The commissioner has set a clerk to look the matter up, as far back as the contract schools have been in existence, and will give me a statement, in writing, in a few days that will be reliable.

The Baptist people have several Indian schools, but they are and ever have been supported by that denomination without Government aid.

It was not until the year 1890 that some of the Protestant churches began to refuse Government appropriations for Indian schools.

September 14, we received from Mr. Moon the following letter, containing the definite information:—

Department of the Interior,
Office of Indian Affairs,
Washington, Sept. 12, 1894.

ALLEN MOON,
President International Religious Liberty Ass'n,
738, 9th Street, N. E., Washington, D. C.

Sir:—Referring to our conversation of 11th instant, relative to contracts, for the education of Indian children, with the Baptist Church, you are informed that I find records of contracts from the year 1879 to 1884, between this office and Henry L. Morehouse, of New York City, Secretary of the American Baptist Home Missionary Society, for the Freedmen of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians, in the Indian Territory, as follows:—

In 1879, 6 day schools at $875.00 for six months.
In 1882, 1 boarding school and 8 day schools at $2,250.00.
In 1883, 1 boarding and 8 day schools at $2,750.00.
In 1884, 4 day schools at $700.00, and again in the same year for 6 schools at $1,500.00.

Very respectfully,
FRANK C. ARMSTRONG,
Asst. Commissioner.

We are sorry that the Baptists have not been able to show themselves clear in this matter. If all Protestants had consistently held themselves aloof from all such compromising partnerships with the State, Rome would not now be feeding at the public crib and complacently asking, What are you going to do about it?
