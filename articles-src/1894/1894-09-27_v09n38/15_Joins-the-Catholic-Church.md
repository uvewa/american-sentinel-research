New York, Sept. 9.—The Roman Catholic Church has gained a convert from Episcopalianism in the person of the Rev. Walter Clayton Clapp. The Rev. Mr. Clapp was received into the Catholic Church Friday by the Rev. Father Elliott, at the Paulist Church of St. Paul the Apostle.

Dr. Clapp, during the time of his connection with the Protestant Episcopal Church, was known as a very high churchman. He is thirty-two years old. He was graduated from Amherst College in 1883. He is the son of a New York business man who is a deacon in the Baptist Church of the Redeemer in Harlem.—Washington Post, Sept. 10, 1894.
