ACTING on the suggestion of Mr. C. J. Armistead for the collection of an annual "Spread the Truth Fund" of a million dollars by means of a ten cent contribution from every Catholic in the United States, a lady reader of the Catholic Review writes to it as follows: "Your paper of last week, November 17, was very interesting, and I enclose stamps for an extra copy which I want to send to a friend. In this week's issue is a letter from Mr. Armistead, whose proposal to have every Catholic contribute ten cents towards the publishing of Catholic literature is an excellent one. If you would take it up seriously in your columns and designate a place to send the money, I for one would do my best to get contributions, and I am sure many others would do the same. The world is so flooded with agnostic literature that Catholics ought to make great efforts to spread the truth.—Catholic Review, Dec. 1, 1894.
