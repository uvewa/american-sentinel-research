It is not improbable that the proposition to increase the number of Protestant Episcopal dioceses in this State from five to seven will prevail. Should the additional dioceses be created, they will comprise those of New York, Long Island, Albany, Utica, Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo. These correspond generally to the Roman Catholic dioceses, and are of the same names, except that Long Island and Utica represent Brooklyn and Ogdensburg. That the suggestion of an archbishopric should be made in this connection is most natural. And there would probably be little or no objection to the proposal. England . . . has two, and each is possessed of especial authority. But this could not be exercised here, because of the absence of any union between Church and State. Should an archbishopric be established, it would naturally be expected that Bishop Potter would be raised to the position; and perhaps, in such an event, the example of the Roman Church would not be lost upon the Episcopal Church. The former body has now fourteen archbishops with their seats in the chief cities. The Episcopal Church, should the dignity be created, would naturally increase the number.—The Christian Work, Nov. 22.
