SPEAKING of the International Sunday Observance League, the Chicago Interior says, that "though only incorporated eight months ago," it "is making rapid strides toward giving us a peaceful Sabbath." That sounds good. "Its object," says the Interior, "is to promote a more general and thorough observance of the law of God, as laid down in the fourth commandment."

Can it be possible that this "Sunday" league is teaching men to observe the Sabbath of the fourth commandment, which the Lord says is the seventh day? If this be so, why call it a "Sunday" league? What has Sunday to do with the fourth commandment? That commandment says nothing about Sunday; it speaks of "the Sabbath of the Lord thy God," and says that it is the seventh day. Now, Sunday, as every one knows, is not the seventh day, but the first day of the week. To teach men to observe the Sabbath of the Lord is a noble work, if taught as God teaches it, and as he would have his people teach it. But it can hardly be believed that this league is doing this noble work, or it would not mix Sunday with it.

The Interior says further that the Sunday league is laboring "to the end that the desecration of the Christian Sabbath day . . . may be suppressed." The "Christian" Sabbath day; that is all right. The Christian Sabbath day is the seventh day. Christ kept the seventh day Sabbath when he was on the earth. So then, the seventh day would be rightly called the Christian Sabbath. That which Christ did is Christian, and he is our example. If we do as he did, we shall be rightly called Christians.

Now, when the Sunday league says, "the Christian Sabbath," it means Sunday. But, I ask again, what has Sunday to do with the Sabbath of the fourth commandment? What has Sunday to do with Christ or the name Christian?

A further object of this league for the enforcement of the "Christian Sabbath" is "that man may rest." But physical rest is not the object of the Sabbath as given by the Lord. He said he gave his Sabbath that the people might know that he was the Lord. It is a sign of his creative power, and when men keep it they are pointed back to the creation, and so to God their Creator.

It is true that man obtains physical rest on the Sabbath as well as spiritual, but that is not the purpose of the Sabbath, for God himself rested upon the seventh day. But was it because he was tired and needed physical rest?—Not by any means.

"Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary?" Isa. 40:28. God created the world in six days, and upon the seventh day, the Sabbath, he took delight in the work he had done; and so now, on the Sabbath, man is to delight in the Lord his Creator, calling "the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable." See Isa. 58:13, 14.

Again, the object of this league is "to maintain good morals and the peace and good order of society." And how does it propose to maintain the good order of society?—By establishing "State, provincial, and local organizations, whose object and purpose shall be to coöperate in the enactment and enforcement of laws for the suppression of all violations of the Sabbath day." It is the same old story, of resort to the civil power to enforce not a civil but a religious institution. But why appeal to civil law, why not appeal to the Lord of the Sabbath?—The Lord is not in the Sunday institution, and he will not give his power to a work that is not his; therefore resort is had to civil power to aid them in their work. Sunday is an institution of the papacy. Sunday was substituted for the Sabbath of the Lord by that power. The Word of God, through the prophet Daniel, speaks of a power that should "think to change times and laws," and Roman Catholic authorities have confessed and do confess that they changed the Sabbath, thus changing times and laws. A pamphlet, issued by the Catholic Mirror, gives abundant proof of this, and in it is a challenge to Protestants to show scriptural authority for Sunday keeping. But Protestants acknowledge that there is no Scripture command for keeping Sunday or a Sabbath on the first day of the week.

This league proposes to compel all to observe Sunday, whether they want to or not. They propose to take away the divine right—freedom of worship. If there are those who desire to see legitimate fruits of these Sunday leagues, let them go to Maryland, and there see seventh-day observers in jail for doing what God commanded them to do. The Lord says: "Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work;" but the Sunday law says the first day is the Sabbath, and forbids labor thereon. These Adventists have obeyed the command of God, believing, with the apostles, Peter and John, that it is right to obey God rather than man. Supported by men the Sunday institution will stand for a season, but, supported by God, the Sabbath of the Lord will stand for ever.

No civil law is needed to enforce the Lord's Sabbath, for God is in the work, and his power is enough to turn men to him and his law. Christ says: "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations. . . . Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world." Matt. 28:18-20. This is the commission of the servant of God, and when he turns aside to another power to help the work of God, he has departed from the Lord.
