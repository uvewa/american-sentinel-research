The people who observe Saturday as the Sabbath, seem to have great trouble in America, judging by the following paragraph:—

SABBATARIANS IN AMERICA—A member of this sect having ventured to work on Sunday, keeping the Sabbath—Saturday rest—was fined 10 dollars. This fine he fought on principle with the result that it increased to 110 dollars, when he went to jail, being unable to pay the sum and having exhausted all legal remedies. The American Hebrew has opened a fund on behalf of this victim of bigotry which is being well supported by our co-religionists.—Jewish World.

To be logical and consistent the people who eternally talk about "the Sabbath," should take their rest on Saturdays if they wish really to keep "the Sabbath" and "observe" that day, on the proper day. Sunday is not, and never has been, "the Sabbath."—Free Sunday Advocate, London.
