WITH a million dollars a year collected for a "Spread the Truth Fund" by means of a ten cent contribution from every Catholic in the United States and spent in circulating church literature, a revolution in public opinion could be effected in a decade and an impetus given to the conversion of the American people that would never stop until it had done its work completely.—Catholic Review, Dec. 8, 1894.
