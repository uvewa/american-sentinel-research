Once upon a time a little three-year-old boy was left an orphan and friendless. Unfortunately, the parents had been Jews. A sharp little lady, aged six, who lived next door, begged her mother to take the child for her playmate. The mother, thinking to dispose of the matter without a direct refusal, said, "But, darling, he is a Jew; and you wouldn't like a Jew for your little brother." She reflected a moment, and then said, "No, mamma; but couldn't you spank him, and make him believe in Christ?"

Attention is called to the foregoing, which recently appeared in a humorous journal, for the reason that older heads than grace the shoulders of this precocious little girl, have imbibed the idea that men can be made Christians by compulsion. This never has been done and never can be, because it is directly contrary to the teachings of the Author of Christianity. And just as surely as true Christianity can never be forced into a man, just as true it is that the genuine article can never be forced out of him. For more than a thousand years, the papacy undertook by every means that wicked men and devils could invent to chastise Christianity out of men, but the blood of sixty million martyrs attests the fact that the effort was a dismal failure. The essence of Christianity is that men shall be absolutely free in matters of religion; that is, if of his own free will, he choose to accept the principles laid down by Christ, and him as a personal Saviour, well and good; if not, it is just the same, as far as coercion is concerned, for the Master himself says, "If any man hear my words and believe not, I judge him not." Every individual is ultimately accountable to God, and to him alone, for his course of action regarding religion, and no human being has any right whatever to employ compulsory measures to influence him in deciding what his religious belief and practice shall or shall not be. The gospel principles of separation of Church and State are that the duties we owe to our fellowmen and those that we owe to God are distinct and separate; that Caesar, in his jurisdiction, has nothing whatever to do with the duties that his subjects owe to God. God seeks those worshipers who "worship him in spirit and in truth," and the apostle says, "Whatsoever is not of faith is sin;" therefore any compulsory obedience to the requirements of God makes the individual who thus renders such an unwilling obedience both a sinner in the sight of God and a hypocrite in the estimation of his fellowmen.

But while the Saviour came to this world to set men free, to do away with this "spanking" idea among those who should be his followers, yet, in this enlightened age, in this nineteenth century, in this "land of the free and the home of the brave," we find those who are among his foremost professed disciples resorting to the very measure in principle that this little girl would have her mother employ to change the religions belief of the Jewish orphan. The National Reform Association, the American Sabbath Union, and other kindred organizations, are self-constituted "spanking machines" to regulate men's actions regarding the proper observance of Sunday as a day of rest, and to so change the Constitution of the United States that it would "disfranchise every logically consistent infidel." In other words, the logically inconsistent infidel—the hypocrite—could be a citizen, while the honest man, if a dissenter, could not be a citizen.

To-day, in at least two different States, honest, peaceable citizens are behind prison bars, because they conscientiously rest on the seventh day of the week, in obedience to the command that says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath; . . . in it thou shalt not do any work," and pursue their regular daily vocations on the first day of the week.

The advocates of this "spanking" process say that it is necessary, or the "American Sabbath will be lost to all the people." Perhaps so, for the people are beginning to learn that the Sabbath of Jehovah and the "American Sabbath" are two different institutions; that one is a rival to the other; that God has commanded his people to observe the one, and has never once hinted a word concerning the sacred character of the other. Whether this people who are honestly and conscientiously following the command of God regarding his Sabbath can be chastised into believing that it has no more claims upon them than the day that he has never once named as a day of rest, is a question for themselves alone to answer. We predict that they will only follow in the wake of others who have suffered for Christ's sake. When the "powers that be" undertook to chastise the apostles into quietude regarding the Christian religion, they answered, "Whether it be right to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye." And when in the sixteenth century the civil powers undertook to compel the leaders of the Reformation into silence by legislative enactments, regarding the preaching of the gospel, with a united voice the princes responded, "Let us reject this decree; in matters of conscience the majority has no power." That was Protestantism at that time; it is Protestantism to-day, and this is the very essence of religious liberty.
