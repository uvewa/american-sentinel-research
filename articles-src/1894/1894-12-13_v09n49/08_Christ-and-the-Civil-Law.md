It is worth while to remember that Jesus of Nazareth was persecuted and put to death solely as a politico-social necessity. It was purely a "civil" affair. In the first place, Herod sought to kill him when he was an infant because the wise men came from the East, inquiring, "Where is he that is born King of the Jews?"

Still later, when the fame of Jesus had spread throughout the country because of the good works that he had done, and the people were turning to him, "the chief priests and the Pharisees held a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles. If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him, and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation." John 11:47, 48.

Then Caiaphas, the high priest, said, "Ye know nothing at all, nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not."

Finally, when he was arraigned before Pilate, it was on a charge of sedition and insurrection. Pilate found no fault in him, but the Jews cried out, "If thou let this man go, thou art not Cæsar's friend; whosoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against Cæsar." John 19:12.

Thus it was purely a matter of civil policy throughout. And yet it was solely because of Christ's religious character and teaching that it was done. But "the church," the Jewish people, had no power to put anybody to death, and the Roman government would pay no attention to their religious prejudices. Accordingly they were obliged to make it appear that Christ's religious teaching and practices tended to subvert the peace and even the very existence of the government; and on this basis he was put to death. Will any one say that the crucifixion of Jesus was any the less a heaven-daring crime because he was put to death as a violator of civil order?

Let no one, therefore, think to excuse the persecution of men for keeping the Sabbath instead of Sunday, by saying that Sunday laws are civil, and not religious. Whatever they are called, one fact remains, and that is that they are in direct opposition to the God of heaven and earth.
