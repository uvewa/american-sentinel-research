A CIRCULAR comes to our desk calling attention to the fact that in Maryland, Arkansas, and Michigan persons are being persecuted for keeping the seventh day of the week and working on Sunday. Attention is also called to the fact that three persons are already in jail now for the offense of going about their ordinary business on Sunday. America is sinking to religious persecution rather early in her career as a nation. The principle for which our fathers died—the freedom of conscience in religious matters—is being forgotten. The simple gospel taught and lived by Jesus is the only safe guide in this matter. No person has any right to dictate to any other person where or how he shall worship God. We may believe he is wrong, but that gives us no right to persecute. . . . The gospel, the Constitution of the United States, and real common sense would forbid any one's compelling another to do differently from what his own conscience dictated in worship. We can point the correct way—if we know it. The Bible is very plain and any way-faring man, etc., need not err. It does not say he will not err, but he need not err. A little more Bible and a little less theory about the Bible would help lots of us.

The seventh-day people have been bitterly persecuted in localities—always by persons of other denominations of Christians, too, to their shame be it said. Personally we think the seventh-day people have not read the Bible as they should, but that only places us where we should persuade with the Word and not persecute with the civil law. These persons are not intentional law-breakers. May the time soon come when we shall see the truth as it is.—New Era, Grand Junction, Iowa, Nov. 24.
