LONDON, Nov. 30.—The Morning Post has this dispatch from Rome:

"In connection with the reunion of the Eastern and Western Churches the pope is preparing a constitution, presumably the one recording the decisions of the recent conference. Among its provisions will be one to determine the functions of the later missionaries in the East. The issue was delayed that the Vatican might agree with France, who is anxious to secure the direction of the whole missionary movement with a view to strengthening her protectorate over Catholics in the East. This was opposed by the Vatican.

"It is stated that, as the result of Mgr. Macchi's recent mission, the Chilian, Mexican, and Nicaraguan legations will be restored at the Vatican."—New York Sun, Dec. 1, 1894.
