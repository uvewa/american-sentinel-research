ANDREW HERTZEL, a German, 40 years old, who is employed in a Williamsburgh slaughter house and lives at 204 Johnson Avenue, was charged by his wife in the Ewen Street Police Court yesterday with assault. The woman's left eye was badly discolored and she seemed to be intoxicated. While Justice Watson was questioning Hertzel his wife interrupted the justice, and he ordered her to keep quiet. Hertzel was about to be sentenced to the penitentiary for six months, when the woman pleaded for mercy for the sake of her four children.

After eyeing Hertzel for fully a minute Justice Watson called the Rev. Henry Orne, a clergyman who attends court every day and holds services there on Sunday afternoon, to the bar.

"What shall I do with Hertzel?" the justice asked of the minister.

"I don't know, I am sure," said Mr. Orne. "The children will suffer I suppose."

"That's it," exclaimed Justice Watson, "I don't consider the woman. It's the children I'm worried about."

Then looking at Hertzel the justice said: "Look here, Hertzel, I am going to let you go. This minister here, Mr. Orne, is going to hold divine service in this court room to-morrow afternoon. You come at 4 o'clock and report to him. Come next Sunday the same way, and keep on coming so long as the services are held. Report to the minister every Sunday, and he will let me know. If you fail to attend on one Sunday he will let me know, too, and I will take these papers and send you to the penitentiary for six months. Mark what I tell you. Come every Sunday, and bring your wife with you."

Hertzel was paroled in the custody of the minister, and as they turned away from the bar, Justice Watson called to Hertzel:

"When you come here to church you want to pray long and pray earnestly and sincerely, because, otherwise I don't think there is much hope for you. There is great efficacy in prayers, of which we have many instances in Dutchtown."—New York Sun, Dec. 2, 1894.
