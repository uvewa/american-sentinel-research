Neither in Brooklyn nor in this city [New York] nor any where else in the States must saloons be allowed to keep open on Sunday. And not only must we have a Sunday law, but the law must be enforced, as it is not now: and this . . . will be accomplished when the next legislature meets.—The Christian Work, Nov. 22.
