In London the school question is more pressing even than it is with us. The present government is, through its official, Mr. Asquith, opposed to the denominational schools, whereas Lord Salisbury has come out openly in favor of religious education. Consequently, Cardinal Vaughan, in the discharge of his duty, has advised the Catholic voters of the metropolis to support those candidates who are not pledged to secularize the schools. Whereupon . . . that everlasting blunderer, Mr. Michael Davitt, and other anti-clerical McCarthyites have violently denounced his eminence, the Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster, and have urged the Catholic voters to disregard his authoritative suggestion in a question involving morals and episcopal rights. Mr. Davitt is especially bitter and radical. No obligation, he says, rests on Catholic laymen to think as do the priests on the election of a Commoner or member of the School Board, even when the faith of children is at stake and when there ought to be and can be no room for a diversity of opinion in a matter in which the church has so clearly spoken, and he basely intimates that the cardinal utilized the question of religion in education in order to electioneer for the Tory party. No wonder that the Healyites are restless under such antichristian leadership.—The Catholic Review, Nov. 24, 1894.
