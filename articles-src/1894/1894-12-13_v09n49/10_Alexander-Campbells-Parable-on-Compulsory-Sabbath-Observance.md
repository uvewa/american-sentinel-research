[In 1820 there was organized in West Middletown, Washington Co., Pa., a society, called the West Middletown Moral Society. The principal object of the society was to enforce the Pennsylvania Sunday law of 1794, which is still on the statute books of the State. This Moral Society was organized by the United Presbyterians, the same people who, later in 1863, organized the National Reform Association. Alexander Campbell, the founder of the Christian or Disciple Church, ably opposed the society in a series of articles published in the Reporter, of Washington, county seat of Washington County. His articles were signed "Candidus." A United Presbyterian minister, by the name of Wylie, attempted to defend the society, and signed himself "Timothy." The discussion continued from April 17, 1820, the date of Mr. Campbell's first article, to February 22, 1822, during which time almost every phase of the compulsory Sunday law question was treated. As a result the Moral Society perished, not to appear again until 1863 when it was revived by the same denomination under the name, National Reform Association. Every word of Mr. Campbell's invincible logic and withering denunciation is applicable to the association, reenactuated under the name, National Reform Association, and kindred organizations, such as the American Sabbath Union, the Pennsylvania Sabbath Association, etc.]

CHRISTIANS are often compared to sheep and the wicked to wolves and dogs. This comparison is designed to exhibit the peculiar temper and disposition of each towards the other. Now it has never been known that the sheep have used any violence or coercive means to subdue or persecute the dogs or wolves. The moral societies suggested to us the following fable, in reference to the above similitude. I don't know that ever it appeared in print before, and had it not been for the moral societies, in all probability it never would. It is full of instruction; it is this:—

Once on a time, we can't tell how long ago, some wild goats had put on the garb and accent of sheep and associated themselves with a large flock of sheep in Western Pennsylvania. The country in those days was much infested with wolves and dogs, which often committed depredations on the harmless sheep. The sheep were intimidated by their frequent incursions, insomuch that they could not browse in the midst of daylight, if they only heard the howling of a wolf or the barking of a dog at the greatest distance. After the complete settlement of the country the wolves became less injurious. The dogs increased with the inhabitants, and came to a better understanding with the sheep, so that they often had intercourse with each other, and only occasionally did the dogs become a foe. The wild goats having now become identified with and scarcely distinguishable from the sheep, and being naturally of a zealous and haughty disposition, laid a project for overcoming the dogs and securing to themselves and the sheep the complete domination of the West. Whereupon at a full assembly of the sheep some of the wild goats made a motion to the above effect, and after much discussion a large he goat mounted a stump, and thus addressed the assembled crowd:—

"Brethren of the sheep fold, the dogs were once our enemies, and they are not good friends yet; we are numerous and can act in concert; we will not kill the dogs, but let us compel them to eat grass with us, and thus domesticate them; let us butt them stylishly with our horns, and form ambuscades and groups for this purpose."

The vote was taken and the measure carried. Then associations, called domesticating associations, were formed, composed chiefly of wild bucks and a few rams. The business of these associations was to scour about the sheep-fold during the hours of browsing, and if they saw a dog passing along the road, they inveigled him or compelled him into the fold, then they surrounded him and "thumped him mivendibly" until the poor dog took a few mouthfuls of grass, which sat so badly upon his stomach, he soon served an ejectment upon it. In this way they proceeded for several years, and never domesticated a single dog. The practice finally fell through; all the sheep gained by it was ill will, and all the dogs gained was bruised heads and broken ribs. The application is easy and the moral good.

CANDIDUS.

P.S.—As some parts of the above are like the "Holy War," figurative, for the sake of those who are dull of hearing I will add one note: Sheep denote Christians, the grass the food of Christians, wild goats hypocrites, and dogs, men of the world. For the spiritual meaning, consult Matt. 7:6; 7:15; Phil. 3:2.—Candidus (Alexander Campbell) in Washington (Pa.) Reporter, Oct. 1, 1821.
