CONVERTS are coming into the Catholic Church steadily in all parts of the United States. For instance, last year in the remote, sparsely settled and poorly-equipped diocese of Jamestown, North Dakota, which has only about forty priests to cover the whole State, there were one hundred and one adult converts baptized. How the clergy found time from their ministry to their Catholic flocks to instruct these neophytes, is a wonder, although Bishop Shanley is a host in himself and his priests have his spirit of zeal. Yet their harvest garnered under the difficulties of a pioneer State, is a straw to show how the tide is running under more balcyon conditions. Everywhere new members are coming into the church. We who have the faith should pray more, give better example, and circulate more good books like "The Faith of Our Fathers," and instruct newspapers so as to take advantage of the current to hasten the conversion of America.—Catholic Review, Dec. 8, 1894
