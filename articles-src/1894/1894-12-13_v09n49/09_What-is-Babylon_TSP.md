BABYLON is composed of the mother church and her daughters. Rev. 17:5.

Babel is Babylon. Babel is confusion, disorder. Self-contradiction is confusion. A mixture of good and bad is disorder.

In the Michigan Christian Advocate of March 10, 1894, Rev. L. Wigle, pastor of the Methodist Episcopal Church of Indian River, Mich., makes serious charges against the people who are called Seventh-day Adventists; which he has a right to do, providing he tells the truth.

Mr. Wigle's charges, however, are false; and that he cannot be believed will be shown by three witnesses from his own church, whose testimony clearly shows one of his claims to be false, and as other charges that he makes have nothing to sustain them but his own words and a few misapplied extracts, the examination of only one charge, with its accompanying claim, will show that his word is unreliable, and that the teachings of his church are contradictory.

In an indirect way Mr. Wigle claims to be walking according to the Bible, for he says, "We prefer to listen to our old Bible still." In the same indirect way he says of the Seventh-day Adventists, "To meet them, we need to fortify ourselves with Scripture." This is a charge that Adventists are walking contrary to the Scriptures and a claim that he and his church are walking according to the Scriptures.

That his claim is the opposite of the truth is proved by the following witnesses: Dr. Binney, in his Theological Compend, attempts to defend infant baptism. He admits that there is no positive command for it, and he attempts to parry the force of this fact by saying, "Nor is there any for keeping holy the first day of the week." Here is proof that Methodists, instead of the Adventists, are walking contrary to God's Word.

Methodists claim that it is a sin to work on the first day of the week, but the Bible says, "Where no law is, there is no transgression." Dr. Binney admits that God has no law of that kind; and no person in Mr. Wigle's church, or anywhere else, has ever found a command in the Bible forbidding work on Sunday. So when any church, or all the churches combined, claim that it is a sin to work on the first day of the week, they are assuming that they know more than the one who gave us the Bible; who alone has a right to tell us what sin is.

Instead of teaching obedience to the one Law-giver, the churches have fallen so far that they take it upon themselves to manufacture something that they call God's law, and declare it as his statutes. This is proved by the second witness which we produce against Mr. Wigle's testimony.

According to a sermon of our second witness, reported in the Chicago Herald of May 22, 1893, Rev. James Miller, pastor of the Marshfield Avenue Methodist Church, Chicago, in preaching to his own congregation, May 21, said:

We Christians have changed the day and have decreed that the first, and not the seventh, day shall be observed as the Sabbath; and we have done this without any pretense of authority from either the Old or New Testament, except that which is strained and forced to meet the emergency of an argument.

Mr. Miller states the case about as it is, if by his term, "we Christians," we understand him to mean people who are called Christians. No doubt many of the class of Christians who have done this thing, and who are now defending the thing that has been done, dislike very much to be exposed by Mr. Miller's words, but his words are sustained, and cannot be denied. That wicked charge was made hundreds of years ago, and men are still sustaining that wicked thing. And in this they are not only trampling upon God's authority themselves, but they are making almost superhuman efforts to keep people in ignorance of what God's Word commands, and what it does not command. God says, "In vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men;" yet they are laboring hard to hold people in obedience to an institution of man, in opposition to what God commands. Methodist ministers are uniting with others to secure the conviction and imprisonment of those who obey the commandment of God rather than the commandment of men.

The fiftieth Psalm tells us that when the Lord comes he will say to the wicked, "What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth? Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee."

The third witness which we produce against Mr. Wigle is Rev. James H. Potts, D. D., editor of the Michigan Christian Advocate: In his pamphlet entitled, "The Lord's Day, Our Sabbath," Dr. Potts expresses himself decidedly against looking to the Bible for a command in the matter of difference between him and Seventh-day Adventists. He mentions the demand that some make for a command of God concerning the keeping of Sunday, and, being unable to find one, he says, "Such a demand is absurd." If he could find such a command he would gladly produce it for the benefit of those who still have some respect for the authority of God's Word, but as he cannot find one, he is obliged to confess it by saying, "Such a demand is absurd." This is found on page 25 of his old edition, but on page 40 of his revised edition of 1894, he says, "This requirement is absurd." We have a right to demand it because God requires it. God requires it when he says, "Where no law is, there is no transgression." Rom. 4:15. Because God requires his own law to convict a man of sin, and because we demand it of those who seek to convict us of sin, Mr. Potts says, "This requirement is absurd," and "Such a demand is absurd."

Methodists are as active as any in imprisoning Sabbath-keepers for what is called the sin of Sunday-breaking, but to call a thing sin that is not a transgression of God's law, is to place man's requirements above God's requirements, which is to place man above God.

Adventists have no disposition to defend themselves when they are attacked, or to gain sympathy when they are persecuted. Their sympathy is for the honest people who are influenced by the misrepresentations of the leaders of the fallen church. For this reason, and because the message from Heaven says, "Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plague." Adventists sometimes find it necessary to expose the conduct of some men, even though such men attempt to hide themselves and their work behind the sanctity of the pulpit.

God has said, "Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird." Those who know the meaning of this, and who know that it is fulfilled to-day, are commanded by High Heaven to show the people of God what Babylon is; what the unclean birds are; and to call his people out of her, "For her sins have reached to heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities." Rev. 18:5.
