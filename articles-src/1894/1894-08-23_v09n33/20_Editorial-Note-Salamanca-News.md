THE editor of the Salamanca News, formerly the Bugle Horn, informs us that his paper "recognizes that there are other things deserving treatment as well as 'prohibition and woman suffrage,' and treats them, too," and asks, "Does the SENTINEL do likewise?" Well, yes. In fact, as those subjects are generally treated they have never seemed to us to be very important, and we have given our attention very largely to other issues. But that is no reason why the Bugle Horn, News, or whatever the thing may happen to be this week, should violate the ninth commandment. In referring to this paper it says: "If a person were to read the AMERICAN SENTINEL, he would be led to conclude that there was only one commandment, and that for the observance of the Sabbath." Now, the editor either knew when he wrote that he wrote a falsehood, or else he had not read the SENTINEL, and so did not know whereof he affirmed. He can choose which horn of the dilemma he will take. The good Book says: "He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him." Our contemporary may not be malicious but only demonstrating the truth of the Scripture.
