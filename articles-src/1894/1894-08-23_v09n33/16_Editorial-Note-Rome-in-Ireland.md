SURELY the country in which Romanism gets the most and gives the least is Ireland. A Dublin paper says that to any one who has much to do with religious work in Ireland it is evident that Rome is not changed in the matter of persecution. The other day a mother who had placed her children in a convent in the suburbs of Dublin, went to reclaim them, she having, since their admission, become a Protestant. A hostile crowd assembled, and the mother was compelled to go away without her children. It will be like this in America if the Romanists and the half-breed Protestants have their way.—*The Denver American.*
