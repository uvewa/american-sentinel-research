In an editorial paragraph in the Examiner of this week, you say: "We are fighting for the good old Baptist principle of complete separation of Church and State." Will you please state your position on our Sunday laws, which are at present causing outrageous persecution for conscience' sake in different parts of our country. One young man, a Mr. Capps, in Tennessee, only a few weeks ago, was taken from his family, a young wife and four small children, one of them sick at the time, living in the woods, at a distance from any neighbor, and is serving a sentence of fifteen months in jail, for laboring on Sunday after having kept the seventh day as sacred. That the origin, purpose, and sentiment that is now supporting our Sunday laws are wholly religious, can be easily seen even by a careless observer.

G. B. W.

So writes one who, we infer, cannot have been a reader of the Examiner long, or he would be in no doubt regarding its position. In our issue of Feb. 15, we expressed our sentiments in no doubtful terms, in an article headed, "Shame on Maryland," regarding a similar case of persecution. A year or two ago such a case in Tennessee called forth an equally unmistakable declaration of our position.

Set it down as a fundamental principle of the Examiner that it is opposed to persecution of all kinds, everywhere. It is a Baptist newspaper, and Baptists have always protested, and always will protest, against persecution. It is religious persecution, nothing less, to punish men who keep the seventh day of the week holy because they labor on the first day of the week. That is for the State to interfere in a matter that belongs wholly to each man's conscience. All laws that thus undertake to enforce the religious observance of Sunday are, to that extent, a relic of the union of Church and State, and should be at once expunged from the statute book of every American State.—*Examiner*, Aug. 9.
