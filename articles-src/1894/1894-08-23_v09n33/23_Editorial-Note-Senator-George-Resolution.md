SENATOR GEORGE has introduced a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution, as follows:—

JOINT RESOLUTION

To amend the Constitution in relation to hours of labor.

Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House concurring therein), That the following amendment to the Constitution of the United States be proposed to the legislatures of the several States, which, when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the States, shall be valid to all intents and purposes as a part of the Constitution of the United States:

"Eight hours shall constitute a legal day's work for persons doing manual labor. No person, association, or corporation engaged in mining, manufacturing, or in any other mechanical pursuit or public work, or in transportation other than watercraft, shall require or permit any employé doing manual labor to work for such person, association, or corporation more than forty-eight hours in one week, except in cases of emergency prescribed by law. Persons voluntarily and lawfully engaged in any of the above pursuits shall not be unlawfully hindered or obstructed.

"Congress shall enforce this provision by appropriate legislation."

It seems that two things are to be accomplished by this resolution; first, six days is to constitute a week of labor; and, second, it is to give the United States undoubted jurisdiction over all labor difficulties. How far it can be manipulated in the interests of Sunday remains to be seen and will depend very much on the legislation enacted under it, should it become a part of the fundamental law of the land.
