LET no reader of the AMERICAN SENTINEL forget that during this hot weather an honest Christian man is languishing in a southern jail for no other offense than working on Sunday according to the express command of God: "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work." He had work to do and he did it; for this he is in prison and will be, if he lives, for months to come.
