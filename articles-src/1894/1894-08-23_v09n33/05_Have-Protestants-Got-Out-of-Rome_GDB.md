Was the Reformation of the sixteenth century a true and complete reform in principle, or was it only partial and incomplete in its principles and consequences? Let the following reflections by Ridpath, in his "Cyclopedia of Universal History," vol. 2, page 615, answer. After stating that the Diet of Augsburg, September 1555, produced a religious peace, which was more than a name, in that freedom of worship and equality of rights before the law were freely and fully granted, he proceeds in the next paragraph as follows:—

It is to modern times, and ever will remain, a matter of surprise, that even in this rather liberal settlement of the religious troubles in Germany, the principles of a true reform, of a genuine emancipation of the human mind and conscience, were still unrecognized. A clause was put into the treaty, that the people should not change their faith until the prince had first changed his! Thus, in substance, was reasserted by the Reformers themselves that very doctrine which they had renounced at the outset as unbiblical and opposed to reason. As a matter of fact, under the rule adopted, the people of the Palatinate of the Rhine were, in the age following the Diet of 1555, obliged to change their faith four times from Catholic to Protestant, and back again, in a vain endeavor to conform to the beliefs of their successive rulers!

Such facts as these may well lead us to inquire for a moment into the true nature of the Reformation. The trouble with the reform party of the sixteenth century was that it proceeded unconsciously under one principle of action, and openly avowed another. One motive was, so to speak, hidden in the breast of the movement, and another was given forth as the reason of the insurrection.

In fact, the Reformation tended to one result; in its avowed principles to another. The Reformers said that they set themselves against the authority of the Church, only because that authority had become abusive. They admitted the principle of [Church] authority almost as absolutely as the mother church herself. They claimed to fight against the abuses of authority only. But, in fact, the movement was against the principle of authority. Thus the Reformers were soon obliged to disown the logical results of their own work. The actual tendency was to emancipate men from ecclesiastical and dogmatic thraldoms; but this the Reformers durst not allow. They were afraid to admit the doctrine of religious freedom. They denied that their labors were to that end. They affirmed that their work was to substitute a legitimate for an illegitimate authority in the Church. But what was a legitimate authority? Should the Church decide that question for herself? If so, that was what Rome had said from the beginning, and Protestantism was already on the high road to run the same career as Catholicism had run, and to arrive at the same miserable end. For, suppose that the Church had declared her authority, and the individual judgment and conscience rejected the decision, what then? Would Protestantism punish and persecute the heretic? Her avowed principles declared she must, and her practices soon showed that she would. And for more than three centuries the fatal results of this false assumption of authority, which in the very nature of a genuine Protestantism cannot exist, has distilled its deadly dews in the world.

As a result of this misapprehension or cowardice on the part of the Reformers, the new churches which they established in those countries that fell under their religious sway, became as abusive as the mother church had been before them. True it is that in a certain moral purity—a certain inner cleanness of the organization—the new church was better than the old, but her practices were equally abusive, and her logic worse—worse, because she could adduce, in justification of her conduct, no major premise which had not belonged to Rome for centuries. So when Protestantism, coming into the ascendancy in Germany, Switzerland and England, began to commit in the name of religion, the very crimes of which Catholicism had been guilty, and to justify them by the same arguments, it was not wonderful that sarcastic Rome turned upon her rival a withering glance.

After these clear cut reflections the historian proceeds to outline briefly the events which followed the Diet of Augsburg, in which the true character of the Reformation was seen. He continues:—

It will thus be seen that the Reformers of the sixteenth century, having once made the fatal mistake of taking up the very same major premise under which Rome had all the time been acting, namely, that individual judgment, will and conscience might be properly governed, controlled and coerced by church authority, rushed blindly and of necessity into the same abuses and crimes of which Rome had been so monstrously guilty.

And this came to pass simply because the Reformers did not get entirely out of Rome. Perhaps a complete and perfect emancipation from Roman principles in one or two generations was impossible. The Reformers could not see the logic of their relation to Roman Catholic principles while their great central purpose was organic separation from her communion. Three and a half centuries have passed away and their descendants boasting of greater light fail to see the logic of their modern position on the principles of Rome while they vigorously (?) oppose her outward organization. Rome says the Church was constituted to rule the State. Protestants of Europe and America have all along said and still say the same. Proof—Protestant State churches of Europe and in America clamor for church power in politics and the government. Rome claims infallibility, so does Protestantism, by undertaking to establish her religion on "an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land." Rome forbids the Bible to the common people wherever it is possible for her to do so. Protestantism, by her higher criticism, sets the Bible at naught in the estimation of the people, and results are practically the same.

Rome claims to rest her faith on the Bible and tradition. Protestants, in the great central thought of their religious practices—Sunday observance—admit that they have only the authority of the Church, and they take this charge from the mother church and swallow it without a whimper (See "Rome's Challenge"). Rome claims the right to coerce the conscience to even correct it by punishments, yea, even to burn a soul to save it.

Protestantism upholds Sunday laws, which fine and imprison men for not giving allegiance to an institution which they consider to be an offspring of apostasy and an abomination to God and heaven. Note the manner in which Seventh-day Adventists and Seventh-day Baptists are treated wherever those old relics of the Dark Ages—Sunday laws—are still upon our State statute books. These men cannot conscientiously bow down to this pago-papal antichristian pseudo-Sabbath. But their Sunday-Protestant neighbors give them no credit for any conscience nor admit that they have any rights in this matter any more than did religious bigots of the sixteenth century the dissenters of their time, and so send them to jail. How long before they will demand blood to atone for Sunday desecration? Where is the clear-minded man or woman who cannot see the logic of the present situation? Those who are drunk with the wine of Babylon's false principles will not see but will repeat the history of the past, and thus fulfill the prophecy of God's Word.
