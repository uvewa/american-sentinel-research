THE paragraphs quoted on page 260, from the Examiner, in condemnation of the persecution of Adventists under the Sunday laws of certain States, are from an article, the latter part of which is a weak defense of such statutes on so-called civil grounds. The Examiner's heart is in the right place, but the paper is not consistent throughout.
