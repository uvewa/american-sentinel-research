THE Christian Statesman states that "under the régime of the present emperor of Germany, a strict observance of the law forbidding manual labor on Sunday is being enforced." That is not strange since it is written in the Word of God that all the world shall worship the papacy "whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb." Of course Germany will be no exception; it, too, will exalt the Sunday, the badge of papal power.
