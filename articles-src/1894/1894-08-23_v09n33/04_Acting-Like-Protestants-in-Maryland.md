The Sun, of the 8th inst., had the following:—

QUEBEC, Aug. 7.—A French Baptist mission has recently been established in this city with its headquarters in a building on Bridge Street, not far from its intersection with St. Joseph Street. Yesterday's Le Lecteur contained a reference to this mission and erroneously styled it the Salvation Army. Last night a mob estimated at 5,000 persons gathered round the place and began throwing stones at it. Those in the mission at the time were the Rev. Mr. Burwash, of Grande Ligne, general evangelist, Mr. C. W. Grenier, Grande Ligne, missionary, Mme. Grenier, Mlle. Desjardines, and Mr. Taylor. The attack was a fierce one, and windows and doors soon yielded to the shower of stones. The missionaries were without any means of defense and were held prisoners until after some time a force of policemen came along and cleared the crowd away somewhat.

The mob left the Baptist mission and went up to the building at the corner of George and Richelieu Streets, which is now occupied by the French Episcopal mission. This place, too, was battered with stones, the windows being destroyed. Before the time that the police came up the rioters had moved on to the Salvation Army barracks on Palais Hill.

Another broadside of stones was fired and the property of the army sustained considerable damage. The girls who occupied the place were obliged to flee. The police again arrived too late to make any arrests, and hearing that the gang had again made for the Grande Ligne mission house on Bridge Street, they started in haste for that place, where they arrived just in time to prevent a second riot. The streets were cleared as thoroughly as possible and the missionaries were then escorted to their home by the police.

A similar disturbance led to serious results a few years ago. To-night's papers say that if the police are unable to cope with the rioters and to preserve the peace and protect all law-abiding citizens in worshiping according to the dictates of their own consciences, they should say so at once, and the military will be called out to do it for them. As it is, the tax-payers will have quite a bill to foot as a result of last night's riots, and not a single person has been arrested. Services will be again attempted at the mission house to-morrow.

This is very similar to the way in which certain so-called Protestants in various parts of Maryland act toward Seventh-day Adventists. Is such conduct any less justifiable in one case than in the other?
