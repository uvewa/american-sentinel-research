THE Philadelphia Inquirer, of July 31, has this significant paragraph concerning the trouble between China and Japan:—

Supposing that England and Germany took up the cause of China, and Japan refused to take their advice with the backing of the czar, and supposedly that of France, there would be a war such as the earth never felt before. With 10,000,000 European soldiers, armed and equipped in the latest manner, added to the countless millions of China and Japan, and with several hundred modern warships, there would ensue a war that would bear out all the terrible prophecies of the Apocalypse.

This does not seem probable just now, but the general war referred to as a subject of prophecy will surely come. The Word of God cannot fail. But whether it comes now or a little later the paragraph quoted shows the state of mind which prevails very largely everywhere. General forebodings fulfill the words of our Lord: "Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things that are coming on the earth."
