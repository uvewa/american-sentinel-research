IN a recent editorial on the state of the churches the Boston Herald says: "Between this age and those which have preceded it, there is no point of difference more clearly marked than that which relates to the attitude of the State toward religion. Not even the mechanical triumphs of our age would make a greater impression on men of another time permitted to revisit earth than this unqualified subjection of the Church to the State. For it is a complete inversion of the order of society out of which our civilization has grown and in which our liberty found its roots. The doctrine that the State has no concern with a man's beliefs is a conception so decidedly modern as not yet to have made a complete tour of civilization. There are certainly countries within the pale of civilized intercourse in which it would be scouted as energetically as it would have been in the England of three hundred years ago, where restless and daring spirits were already beginning to conceive the scheme of founding a greater England across the western main." Our contemporary is a little over-confident, however, when it assumes that there is no substantial danger in these days from the encroachments of any church in the sphere of government. We have only to recall recent attempts to introduce a religious creed in the Constitution, and the Sabbatarian agitation to close the World's Fair on Sunday, to be reminded that ecclesiasticism is anxious enough to use government for the restriction of liberty.—*Christian Register.*
