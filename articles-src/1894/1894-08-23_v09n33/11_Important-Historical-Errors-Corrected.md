A work has recently appeared on "The Sources of the Constitution of the United States." Its author is Dr. C. E. Stevens, the rector of a Protestant Episcopal church. The book has received high praise for fullness of information concerning the relations which our political institutions bear to those of the mother country. It contains, however, evidence that the author holds "a brief for his pet theory of the exclusively Anglican source of our American ideas." Dr. Lewis G. Janes, President of the Ethical Society of Brooklyn, points out serious historical errors in the work, and does it so conclusively as to deserve the thanks of the public.

The statement of Dr. Stevens which he refutes is this:—

The boast is wont to be made that the Puritans of New England led the way in establishing by law religious toleration. A similar claim is still put forth in behalf of the Baptists of Rhode Island. Truth must award the honor to Maryland, where action proceeded from a combination of Roman Catholic and non-Catholic conditions. This action of Maryland took place in 1649, and that of Rhode Island in 1663. In the next year (1664) the proprietaries granted to the colonists of New Jersey the widest toleration. Enactments known as the Duke's laws, issued in 1663 by an assembly which met on Long Island at the call of Governor Nicholls, declared that no person professing a belief in Christianity should be molested for his judgment in matters of religion.

On this Dr. Janes shows, first, that the Maryland declaration limited the conditions of toleration to those Christian sects who did not deny the doctrine of the Trinity, and excluded not only all non-Christians, but all Unitarian Christians, from its benefits. He then shows that the original compact of the settlers of "Providence Plantations," 1636, bound the inhabitants to submit themselves to all orders and agreements made for public good by the majority "only in civil things." He shows that March 17, 1644, five years before the date of the Maryland edict, a charter had been obtained at the personal solicitation of Roger Williams, during the period of the Commonwealth in England, which expressly affirmed the principle of noninterference of the civil government with matters of conscience and belief, and that even before that the towns had by mutual agreement organized a general government and chosen representatives to a legislative assembly. One of the first acts of this assembly was to affirm the principle of religious liberty in these words: "That none be accounted a delinquent for doctrine, provided it be not directly repugnant to the government or laws established."

Roger Williams held the doctrine of "soul liberty," and he argued that neither papists, Jews, nor Turks should be deprived of liberty of conscience, or be forced to observe any other worship than that which satisfied their own conscience. Having disposed of this matter, and thus shown that Dr. Stevens errs in fixing the date of the Rhode Island Edict of Toleration in 1663, because that year King Charles II. granted a charter to the colony, for the Baptists preceded that seventeen years; he then observes that the exclusive claim sometimes made for the Baptists of Rhode Island is also open to objection, as the doctrine of "soul liberty" was proclaimed as the corner stone of the new commonwealth before the Baptists, or the Anabaptists, as they were then called, came thither from Massachusetts, and before Roger Williams himself was converted and baptized into that faith; but that Roger Williams was in fact the founder of the first organized commonwealth in the world's history that expressly affirmed the doctrine of soul liberty and the complete separation of religion from the control of the civil authority.

We have long been aware that the most careful critics hold that the religious toleration which prevailed in Maryland, so much vaunted, was "evidently dictated by worldly prudence rather than prompted by advanced charity," and became aware of it in a very peculiar and somewhat humiliating manner. The writer, making an address in Maryland, paid it the usual compliment for being the first to establish toleration, and one of its citizens took him aside afterward, and said that that was rhetorically proper, but if he would investigate closely the facts he would discover that it was an act dictated by political prudence, under a condition making it practically necessary to give the Roman Catholics what they wanted, and was not upon a principle of general liberty and the right of all to it, but was restricted to serve the purposes of those who formed the combination.

Dr. Janes justly observes that it is to the honor and credit of Roger Williams, who, during his whole life was involved in controversies with papists, Quakers, Puritans, and many others, that "in spite of these controversies and disagreements, he steadfastly upheld the right of every sort of schismatic to hold his own opinions, obedient to the dictates of his own conscience, without interference by the civil power."—*N.
