IN a sermon in this city, July 29, Rev. Thomas Dixon said:—

The outlook for the immediate future is one of suffering and oppression. The capitalists will surely retaliate on the workingmen. They will triumph in their strength. Yet they should not imagine that they are safe from future violence. Another strike is bound to come. It will affect every industry and paralyze the world. I predict that a fearful struggle will occur in the near future.

Thoughtful men everywhere take a similar view of the situation. The outlook is not promising from a worldly standpoint. But while men's hearts are "failing them for fear and for looking after those things that are coming on the earth," the foundation of God stands sure. He will be the refuge of his people.
