Mr. George, of Mississippi, has introduced into the Senate a joint resolution for an amendment to the Constitution providing that eight hours shall be a legal day's work for persons doing manual labor, and forbidding an employer to allow an employee to work more than 48 hours a week. But why 48? Is there anything sacred and mystical about that number? There would still have to be a Saturday half holiday. That would reduce the hours of labor to 44 a week. Then there should be a mid-week rest on Wednesday. Hours of labor remaining, 36. But Monday should be fishing day, Tuesday hunting day, Thursday speech and convention day, and Friday should be set apart to making the hours of labor still shorter. Then instead of 48 hours a week, 6 hours a week would be a constitutional week's labor. Still, Mr. George could have done better by resolving to abolish hours and labor altogether.—*The Sun.*
