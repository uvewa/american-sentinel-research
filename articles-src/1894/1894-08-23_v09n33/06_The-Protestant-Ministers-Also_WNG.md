A GREAT deal has been said, and much of it justly said, about the arrogance of the Catholic priesthood in the matter of the expurgation from the public school text-books of certain matters of well authenticated history, which show up the papal church of the past in an unenviable light. Much has also been said, and justly said, in denunciation of the subserviency of certain boards of education (notably that of San Francisco), in yielding to the aforesaid demands of the Catholic clergy. One who has given utterance to the bitterest words against Catholics and Catholic aggression is a leading Protestant minister of Stockton, Cal.

And now come the Ministers' Union of that city, including that same bitter critic of Catholic arrogance, to present a demand to the school board of Stockton, involving the same principle as that of which such loud complaint has been made against the Catholics. It appears that the principal of the high school took occasion to deliver some lectures before his classes on the subject of "evolution," to which the ministers, and quite a good many other people for that matter, took exception; and the Ministers' Union, in their ministerial capacity, formally protested.

If the said principal transcended his prerogative as a public school teacher in presenting before his classes, as such, matter of a disputed character not included in the authorized curriculum of the school, the ministers, as citizens, had a legitimate right to protest, and protest earnestly. But that their protest should have any more weight because they are ministers, is sheer assumption. And that assumption is becoming more and more marked as the clergy, both Protestant and papal, assume authoritative functions in the promulgation of their doctrines.

As evidence that the Ministers' Union of Stockton, deem their protest of superior importance on account of the ministerial position of the petitioners, we present one of the resolutions contained in said protest. It reads as follows:—

Resolved, That the school board be also requested by us as ministers not to employ as teachers in our public schools those who will knowingly and intentionally teach in the schools such things as they know to be directly opposed to the teachings of every pulpit in the city, and that without warrant or authority found in the course of study or curriculum adopted by the board, and also, in our estimation, contrary to the spirit of the laws governing the public schools.

As before stated, there is no doubt of the right of the ministers, as citizens, to protest against the introduction in the schools of unauthorized matter; but when they protest against the teaching of anything merely for the reason that it is opposed to that which is taught in their pulpits, then their position is as unwarranted and dangerous as that of the Catholic prelates who demand the expurgation of historical facts from the text-books because such facts are opposed to the teaching of the Catholic pulpits. Whenever our Protestant brethren assume special prerogatives for the ministry or for the Church in secular affairs, they place themselves on Catholic ground. Whenever they assume that the voice of the ministry should be heard above that of others in such matters, they mount the Catholic platform.

The tendency of Protestantism to-day is strongly set that way. As it was in Great Britain in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the contest between Protestantism and Catholicism is not for purity of religion, but for political influence. In those days when Catholic prestige was overcome, Protestantism assumed the prerogatives that the vanquished religion temporarily laid down, and vice versa. To-day, when Protestant ministers assail with bitter denunciations the presumptuous acts of Catholic authorities, we are apt to see them ambitious to wield the same power that they deny to the Catholics. If we are to have Church domination in secular affairs, it matters but little to the masses which Church is the dictator,—it is bigoted oppression in either event. As the spirit of Church dictation in secular matters is the papal spirit, whether it proceed from a Protestant or Catholic professor, it will finally lead to papal victory. Much that is nominally Protestant to-day, under the growing Church-and-State spirit will shortly appear in its true papal character. The "deadly wound" of the papal "beast" is fast healing, and it is being healed with the effective salve of professed Protestantism, which is blinded with the delusion that there is spiritual power in numerical strength and political influence.
