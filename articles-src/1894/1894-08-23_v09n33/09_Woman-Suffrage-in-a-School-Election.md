Much ill-feeling has been engendered in South Amboy by the school election. The election was the first held under the new law, and a full board was elected. The trouble has grown out of the action of the priest in charge of St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church, who, it is said, ordered the women of the parish to vote for the candidates of their religious faith. About the time the polls opened the Catholic women met in St. Mary's School Hall. From there they went to the polling place in blocks of four. All were provided with ballots.

The Protestants knew nothing of this until the women began to vote in large numbers, always four in a squad. They soon found out what was going on. For the rest of the time the polls remained open there was lively work on the part of the Protestants to overcome the advantage obtained by the Catholics. The wives, daughters, and sweethearts of the Protestants were hurried to the polling places as soon as possible.

Many of them were called from bed to cast the ballot they were entitled to. It was too late when the work of the Protestants commenced to avail them much. The count showed that the Catholics had elected six of the nine trustees. The Protestants claim that they will contest the election on the ground that many of the women who voted were not of the required age. It is understood that prominent members of the Junior Order A. P. A. will enjoin the board from entering into the discharge of their duties. This will bring the matter into court on quo warranto proceedings.—*Primitive Catholic.*
