REV. A. MEILLE, a Waldensian pastor in Italy, comments very pertinently on the encyclical letter regarding the "Study of the holy Scripture" issued some months ago by the pope. In a late number of the Voice from Italy, a missionary periodical of the Waldenses, he writes:—

"Those who fondly hoped that the encyclical marked a new departure in the attitude of the church of Rome towards the Bible must recognize that, on the contrary, all the old positions are maintained without a single exception. At the very outset, oral tradition is placed on the same level as the written word, as being equally with it a revelation of God. 'The church' is declared to be the only custodian and rightful interpreter of the Bible.

"There is not the slightest promise in the whole encyclical of the Bible ever being given into the hands of the people, who must remain satisfied with such fragmentary portions of it as they can find in their mass books or hear read from the steps of the altar. And as for the priests, they themselves are not to be allowed to study the Scriptures in an independent manner.

"Then the text-book to be placed in their hands is the Latin Vulgate Version, and recourse to what is curiously called 'the previous languages' is only to be allowed in special circumstances. No one is permitted to expound the Scriptures in a way contrary to the meaning attached to them by the church or the unanimous consent of the fathers."
