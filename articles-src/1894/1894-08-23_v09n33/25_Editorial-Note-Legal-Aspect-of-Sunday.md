"The Legal Aspect of Sunday: Its History and Character," is the title of No. 22 of the Religious Liberty Library. The work is by James T. Ringgold of the Baltimore Bar, who is not a stranger to the readers of the SENTINEL. The author discusses the historical, moral and constitutional aspect of the question so exhaustively as to leave "no point untouched and no question unsolved." The work is dedicated to members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, though as the preface declares, "the author is not a member of that communion." Though holding views of this question similar to those held by members of this church they are not borrowed from them, since Mr. Ringgold published a legal work embodying these views long before he knew that there was such a people holding them. The matter is divided into seventeen chapters which, together with the prefaces and a very interesting supplement on the present "fad" of "clerical slumming," make a book of 252 pages. The work is a veritable digest of the Sunday law fallacies with their complete refutation. Price 40 cents, with usual discounts to dealers. Order of Pacific Press, 43 Bond St., this city or of the International Religious Liberty Association, Battle Creek, Mich.
