THE Examiner, "the national Baptist newspaper," published in this city, has these pertinent words relative to the influence of women in politics:—

One wonders what sort of women those are who are joining in "ovations" to Col. W. C. P. Breckinridge, the dissolute representative from Kentucky, who is now seeking reelection to Congress. The revolting conduct of which he was guilty, and of which he seems on the whole, rather proud, ought to exclude him for ever, not only from public life, but from the society of all pure-minded men and women. And yet, at a recent political gathering in his district, one hundred "ladies" are said to have been present, and to have lavished upon him the most fulsome flatteries. Is it in such ways as this that "woman's influence" is to purify politics?

The fact is, as we have before remarked in these columns, that men and women are both human, and it is vain to look to human nature for salvation from the evils of such nature.
