DISAPPROVING of the Coxeyite movement does not entail approval of the treatment of the Denver contingent of the army which is now lying in jail at Fort Sidney, Neb. According to the dispatches the men have been confined more than a month in a small building, hardly large enough to accommodate one-half their number. Many of the prisoners have no blankets or other covering, and are compelled to sleep on the bare floor, which is overrun with vermin. They are without the most common conveniences generally granted to even the lowest class of criminals in all prisons. The men are guarded by about forty deputy United States marshals, who allow the prisoners no outdoor exercise except an occasional bath in the creek. Two meals a day are given, generally consisting of boiled beef, often tainted, bread, and a thin infusion of coffee. To make matters worse an epidemic of typhoid fever has broken out among the prisoners.—*The Examiner.*

Are we living in the latter part of the nineteenth century, or in the Middle Ages, which? The men who are responsible for such outrages should be put for a long term where the Coxey movement would not trouble them.
