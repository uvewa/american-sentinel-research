A MISSIONARY of the American Board, writing on the progress of the gospel in Spain, says:—

During the year the editor of a Protestant periodical in Malaga, replying in moderate terms to a violent attack in the public press by a priest, on evangelicals and evangelical doctrine, was summoned by the State's attorney to answer to the charge of holding up to contempt the religion of the State. He asked for the editor a fine of fifty dollars and costs, and imprisonment for "two years, four months and one day." Ball was set at $600. The case was ably and eloquently defended by one of the most prominent lawyers of the district. The judge charged the jury with evident sympathy for the accused, and in a few minutes the jury brought in a verdict of acquittal. The agitation of the case did the cause of the gospel unquestionable good.

If it is God's truth that is at stake it is always certain that nothing can ever be done against it, but for it; and that, invariably, the wrath of man will be made to praise Him. The prosecution of the Seventh-day Adventist publishing house in Basle, Switzerland, is a case in point; that also will do "the cause of the gospel unquestionable good." All who know the circumstances will look to see the Lord work in this.
