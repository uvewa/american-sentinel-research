THE May Arena closes the ninth volume of this leader among the progressive and reformative reviews of the English-speaking world. The table of contents is very strong and inviting to those interested in live questions and advanced thought. Among the important social and economic problems discussed and ably handled in a brave and fundamental manner, characteristic of this review, are, "The First Steps in the Land Question," by Louis F. Post, the eminent single-tax leader; "The Philosophy of Mutualism," by Professor Frank Parsons of the Boston University Law School; "Emergency Measures for Maintaining Self-respected Manhood," by the editor of the Arena. The saloon evil is also discussed in a symposium. One of the strongest papers on heredity that has appeared in recent years is found in this issue from the pen of Helen H. Gardener, Rev. M. J. Savage appears in a very thoughtful paper on "The Religion of Lowell's Poems," a fine portrait of Lowell appears as a frontispiece. Dr. James R. Cocke contributes a striking paper on "The Power of the Mind in the Cure of Diseases." A strong feature of this number is a brief character sketch by Stephen Crane, entitled, "An Ominous Baby." Stinson Jarvis' series of brilliant papers on "The Ascent of Life" closes with this issue.

The Arena has made steady progress; its circulation having increased during the panic, and it has necessarily been enlarged to one hundred and forty-four pages. There is, also, in addition to this, the book reviews, which covers over twenty pages, making in all a magazine of over one hundred and sixty pages. The steady increase in circulation of this $5 magazine during a period of unprecedented financial depression shows how deep rooted and far reaching is the unrest and social discontent; for this review has steadfastly given audience to the views of the social reformers of the various schools of thought.
