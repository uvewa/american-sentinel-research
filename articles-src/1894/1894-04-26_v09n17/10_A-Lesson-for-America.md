RELIGIOUS education in the public schools of London has been a dominant issue for months and has been decided—it can hardly be said to be settled—by the close vote of 27 to 21. The plan adopted makes the Bible a text-book from which the teacher shall give such explanations in the Christian religion and morality as are suited to the capacities of children of various ages attending the schools of the board. This instruction must not "diverge from the presentation of the Christian religion which is revealed in the Bible;" and the teacher is at liberty to elucidate and enforce Christian principles by referring to any part of the Bible. As might be expected, such a scheme has aroused intense opposition. Among the minority of 21 were ministers who opposed the plan because it made school teachers instructors in theology whose teaching would naturally take on the color of their own belief. This issue is growing in intensity, and it is said appeal will be taken to the new board.

All this furnishes a lesson for America. It is the irreconcilable character of this controversy which irrefutably demonstrates the fact that religious instruction by secular teachers is impossible in schools which are supported by the public, and which contain children whose parents share all religious beliefs from Roman Catholicism to Judaism and blank infidelity. And as in London, so here, the opposition to religious instruction in the schools comes from parents of decided religious convictions; the agnosticism of the day is indifferent to dogmatic religion, rather than hostile to it. Very many parents, more especially the fathers, who are usually the agnostics, make no objection to the religious education of their children, deeming it generally useful to them because of its moral cultivation, by reason of which, desirable reverence and elevation of sentiment are encouraged. Where the parents are religious believers, with a definite creed, they are fearful of of any religious instruction by which a dogmatic tinge offensive to them may be imparted.

In this matter it will doubtless be found that what is adapted to the latitude of London is equally adapted to the latitude of New York. Religion dogmatically taught—and there is no religion without dogma—is out of place in a public school, both because the teachers are not qualified to instruct in its tenets, and because if they were, there are too many diversified opinions on the subject to render any reconciliation possible.—The Christian Work.
