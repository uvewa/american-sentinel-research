UNDER the head, "General Rules for Postmasters in the Conduct of Their Offices,—Days and Hours of Business," speaking of when the mail arrives on Sunday, the Postal Department directs:

If it be received during the time of public worship, the opening of the office should be delayed until services have closed. Sunday-school services are not to be regarded as "public worship," within the contemplation of the regulations.

So we see that the United States Government, in this respect, takes it upon itself to determine what is public worship and what is not. S. H. CARNAHAN.
