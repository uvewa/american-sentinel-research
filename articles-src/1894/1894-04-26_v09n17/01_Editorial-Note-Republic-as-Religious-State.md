WHEN the Republic becomes a religious State and the Bible is made the code of civil procedure as of religion, the laws will be formulated upon the Bible as interpreted by the ecclesiastics. Such a condition will be papal, and the church which so rules will be a papal church by whatever title it may choose to name itself.
