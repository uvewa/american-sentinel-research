In the Iowa legislature not long ago a resolution was offered prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors on the "Sabbath." Immediately a member offered as an amendment that the word "Sunday" be inserted instead of the "Sabbath," saying that Sunday was not the Sabbath, but Saturday, the seventh day, was the Sabbath, and consequently if the original resolution should prevail it would, if subjected to accurate interpretation, fail of its intended purpose, and involve a troublesome controversy. The amendment was adopted, and thus the members of the legislature of Iowa showed their knowledge and recognition of the fact that the seventh day of the week is the Sabbath and the first day is not.
