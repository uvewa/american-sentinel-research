An exchange contains this earnest and pungent paragraph, which holds up the mirror to nature so closely that all they who are opposing Catholicism from those motives which impel the natural man, ought to be able to see the old man Adam in it, and recognize whether or no they have yet cast him off. The paragraph is this:—

We are informed by a paper representing a certain self-styled reform faction, that the American people are reckless in "allowing any such press to operate in its limits as will publish any sentiment in favor of the Romish Church." Does not this Protestant bigot and would-be inquisitor have sense enough to see that because Rome in times past acted upon the principle he advocates she made herself the scourge of humanity? That is why she is mistrusted to-day. Cannot this candidate for the editorship of a Protestant Labor Expansionist grasp the fact that in demanding the suppression of Roman Catholic literature he is himself inculcating the fundamental political ideas of that church? She did what he wants to do and for that he curses her! Poor deluded sectarian! Before and above all else is the freedom of the press.

The censorship of the press, and consequent restriction of free speech, is a legitimate conclusion of the premise upon which this "self-styled reform faction," works, —that this is a "Christian nation." If their supposition is correct, according to their application of it, an ecclesiastical supervision of all expression of thought and opinion is logical and inevitable. There will be a struggle to accomplish this very thing. No sooner shall the Congress of the United States commit itself openly and avowedly to their measures by the passage of a national Sunday law, or some such act, than a demand will be made for legislation affixing penalties for writing, speaking and circulating printed matter in opposition to accepted religious forms. A certain foundation for this is already laid in the almost forgotten laws against blasphemy.
