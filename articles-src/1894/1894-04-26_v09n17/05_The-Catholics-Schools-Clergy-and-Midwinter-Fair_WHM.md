The San Francisco Monitor, of April 7, devotes four-fifths of its first page to the question of "Myers' History" in the public schools of San Francisco, and an attack upon the Baptist minister who has made himself obnoxious to the Roman Catholic element by his championship of the book. The publishers of the history and their local agent also receive considerable gratuitous and unsolicited advertising. The A. P. A. and Sunday closing of the Midwinter Exposition do not fail of notice with all the rest. These are the first two paragraphs:

A committee of the Protestant clergymen of San Francisco waited on the director-general of the Midwinter Fair the other day to present a petition in favor of closing the Exposition on Sunday. The papers tell us that they called on Mr. De Evong at the administration building and waited and waited and waited for the director-general who never came. Such apparent discourtesy was most surprising, and we were exceedingly anxious for an explanation. We got it before we finished the account of the incident. An adequate reason why any gentleman should refuse to meet the committee was found in the name which closed the list of its members. J. Q. A. Henry.

Decent people do not like to concert with liars and forgers. Mr. Henry knows he is a liar; we shall prove him a forger. He has suddenly sprung into notoriety by championing the A. P. A. and the A. P. A. programme of bigotry and intolerance. He is now busily engaged in the congenial task of trying to force on the public schools of San Francisco an infamous convention of anti-papist perjurious dignified by the name of "Myers' History." Against him is solidly arrayed the entire body of fair-minded and self-respecting Protestants, but Mr. Henry only knows the morals of his masters, the A. P. A., and fair-mindedness and self-respect are carefully expunged from their commandments.

The Monitor also pays its compliments, in the course of the article to Josiah Strong and his book, "Our Country," and then relapses again into very forcible rhetoric, in the course of which Mr. Henry is called a liar in the tersest form in which that opinion could be expressed, and other equally uncomplimentary terms applied to him in very fluent Saxon.

Taken all together this seems a very furious outbreak against the publishing and teaching of the facts of history. How long will it be before the Presbyterians will be demanding the suppression of the facts in reference to the early persecutions for which they were responsible in New England? and the Episcopalians require that the chapters of general history relating to their course as to the Presbyterians in England and Scotland be expunged before the text-books are laid before the pupils of the public schools? Great crimes and cruelties have been perpetrated by wolves in sheep's clothing under the name of religion, in other folds than the Roman Catholic; why may they not be expected to follow Roman Catholic example in this, as in other things, and require a general expurgation for their benefit? It is more and more evident that the dominant religious faction in this country will eventually dominate, educationally as well as socially and politically.

The San Francisco clergymen have memorialized the executive committee of the Midwinter Fair, asking that its gates be closed during the remainder of the time that the Fair is held. These clergymen deny that they ask this because they are clergymen or Christians, yet the reasons which they assign, in accordance with which the Fair should be closed on Sunday, are all religious. The San Francisco Examiner comments thus:-

The first of these reasons, which is a fair sample of the rest, is that "this is a Christian nation, so decided by the Supreme Court of the United States." Our clerical friends are considerably in error here. The Supreme Court of the United States has no authority to decide this to be a Christian nation, or a nation attached to any other religion. Its powers are strictly specified in the Constitution. They do not include any jurisdiction over matters of belief, except in enforcing the constitutional provisions that "no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States," and that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."

The memorial accuses the committee of expelling the "American Sabbath" and introducing the "gay and godless-Parisius Sunday with sports." On the contrary, the Fair managers have expelled nothing and introduced nothing. They have not expelled the "American Sabbath" of the Salem witch-hangers, because it never existed in our favored State, and they have not imported a Sunday from Paris or any other foreign locality, but have retained unimpaired the bright and wholesome holiday Sunday of California. If we except a very few Midway Plaisance features, which are demoralizing on any day, there is nothing at the Fair which even a delegation of clergymen might not witness on Sunday with distinct advantage.

The memorialists appear to overlook the fact that the Fair is situated a considerable distance from the settled portions of the town, that it employs no emissaries to kidnap unwilling citizens and force them to witness its godless sights, and that even people who voluntarily undertake the long journey to its gates are compelled to yield up fifty cents apiece before they are allowed to enter. Certainly the churches have no reason to complain of such competition as that. They charge no admission fees, and if they want the public to attend their services instead of flocking to the Fair, all they have to do is to make their entertainment as interesting as that at the Park.

These are the same claims which were made as to the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, in but slightly differing phraseology. Clearly the ground has been laid out, back and forth over which the religious contest is to be fought until the end of time. It is wearisome to think of this unending repetition of arguments which prove nothing and of puerile statements which have no foundation in fact, but they will be repeated and repeated until at last by their very wearisome insistence they will be tolerated and then accepted.
