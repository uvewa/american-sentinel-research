SENATOR KYLE has introduced in the Senate a national bill for Sunday rest, and the measure has been referred again to Ex-Senator Blair's old committee,—the Committee on Education and Labor. This bill appears to be identical with that introduced by Mr. Blair in the Fiftieth Congress, with the exception of the title, which is simplified to read merely, "A Bill For Sunday Rest." A thorough discussion of this bill, in all its different phases and applications, can be found in No. 27 of the Sentinel Library—"The National Sunday Law," also in the files of the SENTINEL.
