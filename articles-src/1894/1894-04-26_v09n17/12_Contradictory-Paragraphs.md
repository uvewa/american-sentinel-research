UNDER the head of "Sabbath Reform" the Theocral, of Johnstown, Pa., publishes these contradictory paragraphs:

Eleven nations were represented in a convention the German Emperor called together, and they unanimously demanded a day of rest.

The newly-appointed postmasters of Pittsburg and Allegheny formally took possession of their offices on Sabbath, April 1st.

A new railroad between St. Croix and Yverdon in Switzerland was dedicated at its opening by religious services. One of the conditions for building the road was that no train should be run on Sabbath.

Sabbath, April 1st, was made children's day at the Midwinter Fair, and an immense number was present. The total admissions were 90,907 for the day, making it said, the largest number of persons ever assembled in one place west of the Rocky Mountains.

The claim of the electric street railway of Kingston, Canada, to the right to run cars on Sabbath is being earnestly opposed by the citizens. The mayor seems to side with the citizens.

After many years of hard fighting, the Sabbath opening of picture galleries in London has just been conceded by the Common Council, but only through the casting vote of Lord Mayor. The council stood eighty-eight in favor and eighty-eight against the motion, and it was amid much excitement that the Lord Mayor gave his casting vote. A motion to rescind the resolution will probably come up at the next meeting.

A petition of 251 citizens favoring the passage of the Blair Sunday rest bill was presented to the House of Representatives last week.

Not only are the contradictions elicited here suggestive, but also the breadth of territory and number of nations covered. Let the thoughtful mind consider within how short a time all this agitation has sprung up.
