C. E. MOORE, the editor of the Blue Grass Blade, of Lexington, Ky., has been indicted for blasphemy. Mr. Moore's offending seems to have been in stating the Unitarian views of the human origin of Christ in such positive terms as to have aroused the religious feeling of Congressman Breckinridge's town, which is at this time, no doubt, particularly tender. This is said to be the first case brought under the ancient statute which Kentucky inherits, through the Carolina laws, from Church and State, England.
