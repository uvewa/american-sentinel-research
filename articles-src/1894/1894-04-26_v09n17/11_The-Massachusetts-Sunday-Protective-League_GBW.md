CHRISTIAN patriotism as represented by the Massachusetts Sunday Protective League at the People's Church last Sunday seems certainly a burlesque in view of the avowed object of these Sunday afternoon gatherings, which is to maintain the "fundamental principles of religious and political freedom" and to oppose imagined plottings against the civil Government that have for their supposed object the compelling of every one to conform to certain ideas of right in religious matters, without regard to the convictions, wishes or interests of those who think differently.

The object of the Massachusetts Sunday Protective League is to compel everyone to conform to their ideas of right in the observance of Sunday as a sacred day, without any regard for the convictions, wishes or interests of those who think differently.

Is it "Christian patriotism" for one part of the religious community to arrogate to itself a divine prerogative, compulsion in the observance of a religious institution, while at the same time combining under the beautiful cloak of "Christian patriotism" to prevent another part of the religious community from doing the same thing?

To show further the inconsistency of their position, there is not a single statement in the Scriptures to show that there is any sacredness attached to Sunday whatever, and all the authority there is for Sunday sacredness comes from the Catholic Church. In proof of this statement I refer to the Scriptures, and to the following canon by the council of Laodicea in the latter part of the fourth century, when it was customary to observe the seventh day as the Sabbath: "Christians shall not Judaises and be idle on Saturday, but shall work on that day; but the Lord's day they shall especially honor, and, as being Christians, shall, if possible, do no work on that day. If, however, they are found Judaising, they shall be shut out from Christ;" also numerous statements from Catholic authority.

Many cases of outrageous persecutions for conscience' sake have occurred in different States of the Union recently as a result of the enforcement of the principles of the Massachusetts Sunday Protective League. Upright, godly men have been imprisoned in Maryland the past winter for refusing to regard Sunday as a sacred day by abstaining from work on that day, after having kept the seventh day as sacred. And a startling illustration of the "Christian patriotism" of the Sunday law advocates is that while some of the arrests were made at the instigation of Protestant ministers, almost the only protest against it by the religious papers was made by the Roman Catholic Mirror of January 13.

The "civil plea" which has been used by nearly every persecuting sect, from the time of Christ to the present, is without a shadow of ground in fact. It is that the individual's own health and longevity is promoted by one day's rest in seven. To compel rest on this ground is against the simplest principle of civil liberty, which is, according to the definition in "Century Dictionary": "National liberty so far restrained by human laws, and so far only, as is necessary and expedient for the public good." But these Sunday laws on civil grounds are for the individual's own good, and not for the public. In "Webster's Unabridged Dictionary" it is said: "A restraint of natural liberty, not necessary or expedient for the public, is tyranny or oppression." The State has no more right to compel every one to rest on Sunday for their own good than to compel every one to take a dose of spring bitters at a stated time for their own good.

The welfare of "the poor toiler," upon whom so much sympathy has been expended by the Sunday law advocates, does not weigh a feather when it comes in contact with the sanctity of the day. A large proportion of the "poor toilers" in our large towns and cities are confined closely during the week, and nothing can be more healthful to those who are indifferent to Sunday sacredness than such public amusement as baseball, excursions, etc., which are opposed by the Sunday Protective League because of the sacredness which they attach to the day. A "Christian patriotism," to be worthy of the name, to be consistent, ought to be broad enough to oppose all compulsion in religious matters. It is, however, so much more agreeable to the feelings of some to see others compelled to conform to their ideas of right than to be compelled to do what the "other fellow" thinks is right. The Golden Rule is not taken into account.

The only proper relation of the State to religion is to protect every one in all of their religious observances so far as they do not infringe on the rights of their neighbors, but never to uphold and enforce observance to a religious institution or doctrine.—George B. Wheeler, in Boston Herald.
