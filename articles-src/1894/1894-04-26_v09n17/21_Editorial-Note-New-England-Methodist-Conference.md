THE New England Methodist Conference, in session on April 16, after a warm discussion adopted resolutions "viewing with alarm the oft-repeated attempts of the Roman Catholic priesthood to make our public schools sectarian," declaring also that "the members of the New England Conference will by voice, pen, and ballot, in private and public, in press, pulpit, and on the platform, utter no uncertain sound on the subject of these aggressions." Having adopted these resolutions the conference proceeded with all seriousness and gravity to adopt another set condemning Sunday newspapers, etc.—What a genius for blowing both hot and cold in the same breath, those who imagine themselves Protestants have developed in these last days.
