THE man who is a Christian will be a good citizen and the best of patriots. That is, he will have a love for his country which will lead him to do nothing to her injury, but all for her good. He will give his life, if need be, to save the souls of those who dwell therein. But, as a Christian, he cannot give his allegiance to principles of injustice, intolerance, or iniquity in any form. And if the government under which he is a citizen becomes a party to intolerance, his higher allegiance to Christ will demand that he shall protest against it. Love of country and people will demand it. And yet this very stand for righteousness and truth is ever in great crises misunderstood, and the hero is condemned. Jesus Christ loved Judea and Jerusalem, as none other ever did, but he was condemned as her enemy. Elijah was the truest patriot in Israel, but he was called a troubler. Roger Williams breathed the pure principles of the liberty of the gospel, and would have made a most earnest patriot had he been permitted a home in Massachusetts, but he was driven hence by that people, who considered themselves to be the only patriots and only Christians, but who knew neither patriotism nor Christianity as taught in the religion of Christ.

Do not be deceived. The patriotism of the world is not Christianity, nor will it save a soul. Christianity is not the patriotism of the world; it is much more. It places Christ first, and all things earthly, secondary and subsidiary; but it will labor more earnestly, and make greater sacrifices for mankind, yea, even its own enemies, than the most ardent patriotism ever knew. It is not patriotism, Protestantism, Christianity, nor is it Protestantism, patriotism, Christianity, but it is Christianity, Protestantism, patriotism; and both of the latter, in the truest sense, are found in the former.—Signs of the Times.
