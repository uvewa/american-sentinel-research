THE District of Columbia Sunday bill, which the House Committee on the District referred to the District Commissioners, has been by them sent to the attorney for the District, and he has reported upon it at some length. The attorney reviews the origin of Sunday laws and says that the Sunday legislation of this country, in most of the States, has followed generally the model of the English act of 29 Chas. II. The opinion appended to the historical effort of the attorney is as follows:—

Sunday laws are not based on the idea that it is immoral or irreligious to labor on the Sabbath day, but on grounds of public charity, in order to protect all persons from the physical and moral debasement which comes from uninterrupted labor. Such laws are merciful and beneficial, especially to the poor and dependent, to laborers and mechanics in factories, workshops, and the heated rooms and close quarters of great cities.

The keeping one day in seven as a time of relaxation and reflection, as well as for public worship, is deemed to be of admirable service to the State. It enables the industrious workman to pursue his occupation in the ensuing week with renewed vigor and cheerfulness. From the examination I have been able to give the subject, I do not conceive the necessity for the enactment of the bill in question. All laws should be founded on necessity. If, however, the commissioners on mature reflection should be of opinion that this District stands in need of further moral legislation, the present bill appears to be in good form and they might favorably recommend it to Congress for enactment.

From this it does not positively appear that the attorney for the District is earnestly desirous that the commissioners should recommend to the committee that they ask Congress to pass this unconstitutional measure, neither does he openly oppose the bill on its demerits. Why does he not?
