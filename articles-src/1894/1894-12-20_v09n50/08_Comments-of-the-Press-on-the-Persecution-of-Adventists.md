So far as religious liberty is concerned, the laws of Switzerland are seemingly, strangely and unreasonably discriminating against the Adventists.—Clinton Weekly Age (Iowa).

The dominant religion of Switzerland is Lutheran, but those in power have strayed from his teachings, for he denied the holiness of Sunday, and rather than that his followers should give sanction to such an unscriptural doctrine, he told them, if necessary, to give emphasis to their abhorrence of attributing sanctity to a pagan holiday, to work on it, and even dance on it. . . . We, in the United States, however, can complain with poor grace of the action of the authorities in Switzerland. It is always best to cast the beam from our own eye before we search for the mote in our brother's. As we write, there is lying before us the account of the arrest of two good, upright, peaceable, Christian citizens of Maryland, who have just been incarcerated in prison in that State for following their legitimate vocations on Sunday. They, too, are Seventh-day Adventists. They believe in the ten commandments strictly, the fourth with the rest. They rested on the Sabbath, and were attempting to do all their work on the other six days of the week, as commanded, when they were arrested.

Such laws are totally at variance with the principles at the basis of this government as set forth in the Declaration of Independence and the Federal Constitution.—The Gazetteer, Denison, Texas, Dec. 2.

Religious persecution of the present day does not put on the thumb-screws, torture people on heated iron bedsteads, bore out one's eyes, slip the tongue or burn at the stake, but it does occasionally take up the practice in a degree.—The Charlotte (Mich.) Tribune, Nov. 14.

It is such laws and their prejudicial enforcement that keeps the independent, thinking men and women out of the church. Sometimes we think the nineteenth century is not commenced, let alone being so near its end.—The Four Corners, Wheatland, Cal., Dec. 1.

The Adventists, as a denomination, are conscientious and law abiding citizens. In this country they are quite numerous, and while a majority of them carry on their labors on Sunday, they observe their own Sabbath (Saturday) religiously. Further than this, they give those in their employ, of a different faith, perfect liberty, and never require them to violate their own Sabbath. The prosecution of these people for infraction of the Sunday law smacks very much of religious persecution.—The Dixon (Cal.) Tribune, Nov. 30.

In all these places non-professors, and a good many professors, follow the bent of their own minds as to work or pleasure on Sunday, and no complaint is made; but the instant an Adventist digs a few potatoes, chops a bit of firewood, etc., on Sunday, some one's religious senses are wounded, and that individual immediately proceeds to the Christian(?) work of having his seventh-day neighbor instructed in religious matters through the medium of the courts!—Medical Lake (Minn.) Ledger, Nov. 30.

The International Religious Liberty Association calls the attacks upon the Adventists "religious" persecution. It is difficult, however, to see what religion has to do with such manifestations of hatred and fanatical spirit. The Seventh-day Adventists reject the authority and custom of all other Christian denominations in not observing the first day of the week as the "Lord's day," but that is certainly no reason for alleged Christians displaying toward them the spirit of persecution, which is far more opposed to the genius of Christianity, than any question about the proper day of Sabbath.—Davenport (Ia.) Leader, Nov. 23.

The absurdity of Sunday laws has been shown in Switzerland, where an American Seventh-day Adventist preacher has been put in prison in Basel for working on the Sabbath, though the whole city is given over on Sunday to popular sports. Although the widest latitude is given to diversion in this Swiss city on Sunday, work is very carefully prevented by law, and it was because he chose to set type in his printing office that the American was punished. It is to be feared that this preacher will have to abate his ardor for work and take two holidays during the week, for the Swiss laws are something like those of the Medes and Persians.—San Francisco Chronicle, Nov. 13, 1894.

The public is fairly familiar with the outrageous persecutions of the Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee, where they were repeatedly arrested and imprisoned for exercising their vaunted "religious liberty." It was supposed that this country and Russia were the only "civilized" nations left that possessed an inquisition, but word comes that Switzerland, the "cradle of liberty," has just sentenced Rev. H. P. Holser, a Seventh-day Adventist pastor, to a sixty-one days' term of imprisonment, on prison fare, for working in his office on Sunday. This seems all the more strange because the "Continental Sunday" is observed in Switzerland, as elsewhere in Europe, with noisy revelry.

But they have a law which forbids ordinary labor on Sunday, and this is used by the powers that be to prevent the exercise of the conscience.—Galion (Ohio) Inquirer, Nov. 16, 1894.
