"ANY one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it."

WITH this number of the AMERICAN SENTINEL Vol. IX. closes. The next issue of the paper will be No. 1, Vol. X., and will bear date of January 3, 1895.

LAST week, in giving some account of an assault upon a Seventh-day Adventist colporter by a city marshal in Arkansas, we located the scene of the brutality at Lewisville. That was a mistake. The letter giving us the facts was written from Lewisville, but the assault was committed in Waldo, Columbia County.

A LETTER just received from W. T. Gibson, of Everett, Mass., the Seventh-day Adventist, who was fined fifty dollars and costs for selling a half pound of candy on Sunday, announces that his case, which was appealed, has been postponed to the next term of court with the probability that it will never come to trial. The reason given by the prosecuting attorney for the first postponement was that it ought not to come up until after election. As of old, the persecuting priests fear the people. We will give our readers some interesting matter connected with the trial in the lower court in our next.

THE annual meeting of the American Sabbath Union was held in this city Dec. 9 and 10. As usual, the meetings were small, but boasted great things. A "grand rally" was advertised for Monday evening in one of the largest churches in the city. But the large audience expected did not materialize, and at 8 o'clock the one hundred, or possibly more, present adjourned to the chapel, because the auditorium was too large for such a small gathering. The only notable feature of the evening was a speech by Mr. John W. Wood, general secretary of the Brotherhood of St. Andrew, an Episcopal organization. Much had been said about the "Sabbath," but Mr. Wood boldly took issue with the use of that term and said he preferred the name "Sunday." He said, "We do not keep the last day of the week but the first day; we do not keep the day commemorating creation but redemption; we do not keep a day of rest but of activity," etc. And then he said he thought people ought to go to holy communion in the morning and spend the rest of the day in recreation. He thought excursions down the bay and into the country were in perfect keeping with proper Sunday observance, and said that the real Sabbath-breakers were not the poor who spent the day in recreation, but the rich who made it impossible for them to take recreation at other times. Of course all this was sadly out of harmony with the spirit of the American Sabbath Union. But nevertheless that organization goes marching on in its campaign for more rigid Sunday laws and stricter enforcement of those already on the statute books. Its meetings may be small, but its organization is thorough and its influence far-reaching. It is still one of the powers for evil in this fair land once dedicated to liberty of conscience, but now dominated largely by religious bigotry and intolerance.

A MISSIONARY, writing to the Advent Review and Sabbath Herald, from South Africa, tells of the methods of the British South African Company—which is an English colonial government—in securing its land from the natives. He says:—

The Chartered Company that conquered the Matabeles in the late war, claim their cattle as well as their land to pay expenses. The cunning Matabeles, however, have secreted many thousand head in the bush, which from time to time are found and sold by the Chartered Company.

After thus obtaining the land of the natives, the government offers to give large tracts of this land to missionaries in exchange for their aid in civilizing and christianizing the natives, and thus encouraging immigration. We have been informed by the secretary of the Foreign Mission Board of the Seventh-day Adventist denomination, that a large tract of this land has been offered to Seventh-day Adventist missionaries, but that the land has not been accepted by the denomination. Here was a subtle temptation to violate the great principle of complete separation of Church and State, and we are glad to know that the denomination has not compromised itself.

A READER, writing from Elgin, Nebr., frankly commends the course of the SENTINEL in general, but says:—

I don't think you are justified in your persistent hostility to the Catholic portion of the population of this country. There is nothing in the past history of our country to prove that they are enemies of free government or opposed to a republican form of government.

Our correspondent mistakes opposition to the doctrines of the Catholic Church for opposition to Catholics themselves. We would not injure a Catholic in any way if we could. We would not deny them a single right enjoyed by others; but we would, if we could, induce them to exchange the errors of popery for the truths of the gospel, the bondage of priestcraft for the glorious liberty of the children of God.

We have never intimated that Catholics were opposed to a republican form of government. Individual Catholics no doubt love liberty just as well as do Protestants, and they are no doubt just as ardently attached to republican institutions; but the Roman hierarchy is opposed to all liberty outside the Catholic Church, and to all government not controlled by the church. A republic dominated by "the church" would doubtless suit Rome just as well as any other form of government. Indeed, Leo XIII. seems to be rather partial to republics, doubtless because he finds it easier to dominate the people than to control the princes.

But any government dominated by Rome, or Romish principles, could be nothing but a despotism; and a despotism of the many is not less galling than a despotism of the few or of one. Republican government is a guarantee of civil and religious liberty only so long as the people know what liberty is and prize it as they ought. "Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty," not less in a republic than under any other form of government.

It is superficial reading and thinking that makes people indifferent to encroachments on their liberties, and cause them to rest in fancied security when the very foundation principles of liberty are being assailed. "Rome never changes." And she has promised to do for this country what she has done for other countries. Rome never gave freedom to any country, but she has fettered the mind; stifled conscience; clogged the wheels of mental, moral, and spiritual progress; degraded and debauched whole peoples; murdered millions who dared to think for themselves; enshrouded the world in darkness; and she would do the same again. Verily, "Rome never changes."

"THE Mutiny of the Bounty and Story of Pitcairn Island." This book which is just out, is written by Rosalind Amelia Young, a native of the island, and is a complete history of Pitcairn Island from its occupation by the mutineers of the Bounty in 1790 to the present time. While other books have been written about Pitcairn, none gives so complete a history of the island as does this one, and not all of them together approach the present volume in the story of the domestic and social life of the descendants of the mutineers. The book contains twenty-six illustrations, besides illustrated chapter headings. It is printed on good paper, is well bound in cloth, and is embossed in jet and gold; 254 pages; price $1. Address Pacific Press, 43 Bond Street, New York City; or Oakland, Cal.
