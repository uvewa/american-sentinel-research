Rome, Dec. 6.—A papal decree, the outcome of the recent conferences looking to the reunion of the Roman and Eastern churches, appears to-day.

It provides that ecclesiastical colleges founded in the East by the papacy shall be developed in favor of the Eastern Church. The rites of the latter church shall be maintained intact. Any Latin priest trying to proselyte among Greek Christians shall be suspended.

Roman Catholics in places where there are no priests of that church may attend services held by priests of the Eastern rite without prejudice to their own religion. No more Roman Catholic colleges may be established in the East without papal permission. The pope will found colleges and churches there.

All members of the Eastern Church who live outside Eastern sees will receive instruction according to the rites of their own church, and those who have embraced the Roman Catholic faith can return to the Eastern rites.—New York World, Dec. 7, 1894.
