ALL the world is indeed beginning to wonder after the beast.

In the recent trouble in Armenia, as was to be expected, the Armenians appealed urgently to the pope to approach the Sultan in their behalf. But the "Holy Father," "like all intuitive souls," of course observed the greatest caution, fearing to offend the Patriarch of Constantinople, and thus obstruct the reunion of the Eastern and Western churches, that is so near his heart.

And now comes a dispatch in a roundabout way from Tokio, saying that "on November 8, a telegram was received by the Japanese government from Rome to the effect that the Chinese minister had applied for the mediation of the pope in the war, and that his holiness had replied that he would use all his influence with the European powers to initiate mediation." Count Ito, the Japanese premier, is reported as endorsing the truth of this announcement.

Thus all things are slowly but surely tending toward the aggrandizement of the papacy, and hastening on the time when "all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life."
