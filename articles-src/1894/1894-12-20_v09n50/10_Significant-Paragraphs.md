The new Czar of Russia has celebrated his accession by pardoning a great many people, among them fourteen murderers, in addition to two steamboat captains who are under penalty for having caused a collision between their ships in the Black Sea, by which many lives were lost. It is a very doubtful way of celebrating the coronation to let loose fourteen murderers once more to engage in their favorite industry. It is a very doubtful mercy to the few and very certain danger to the many. Now, if he had ceased the infamous persecution of his Stundists and the Jews, and had released all of these innocent and long-suffering people from punishment and exile, there would have been something in it.—The Examiner and National Baptist, Dec. 13, 1894.

One of the largest retail dealers in New York will not advertise hereafter in the Sunday newspapers, though we believe he has formerly done so. By putting his advertisement in Monday's newspaper he accomplishes two things: he defers to the sentiment of a large and influential part of the community, and he secures a prominence for his business announcements that he could not have in the unwieldy and over-crowded Sunday paper. We do not know but this has come to be a question of conscience with the merchant, or it may be only a shrewd business policy; we pass no judgment on his motives, but we commend his act to the consideration of other retail merchants. Indeed, we wonder that it never before occurred to some of them that there were advantages in "pandering to the moral sentiment of the community." The people who are the largest buyers in this city are people who wish Sunday observed, not with Puritanic rigidity, but with some decency and order. They are thoughtful people, and they recognize the fact that of all the influence promoting the desecration of the Lord's day the Sunday newspaper is the most powerful and the most unscrupulous. Therefore it is safe to say that they will not be less disposed than before to buy of a merchant who shows respect for the day they reverence.—The Examiner and National Baptist, Dec. 13, 1894.
