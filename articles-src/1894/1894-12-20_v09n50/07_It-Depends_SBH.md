APROPOS of the persecutions of Seventh-day Adventists in Maryland, the operation of the Sunday law of that State is brought to bear principally, if not wholly and solely, on this religious sect, who believing that the recognition of Sunday as a religious day would be offensive to the One who established another day (the seventh), exercise the God-given right to work on that day. The writer, on a recent Sunday, happened in the neighborhood of the home of the magistrate before whom R. R. Whaley and W. G. Curlett, recently released from Centreville prison, were tried for Sunday work. Just across the road from the magistrate's home, a man was working in his hay loft while the magistrate was looking on and talking with him. No action was taken against this man. Had he been an Adventist the probabilities are the matter would not have passed unnoticed.

And now comes the Kent County, Md., Sunday-school Association, which held a convention in Millington, recently, and it proposes to do something for an institution for which there is no warrant in the gospel of Christ. Among the resolutions passed by this convention is the following:

We deprecate the violation of the Sabbath law in our county whether such a violation is made in the name of religion or for purpose of pecuniary gain, and believe the time has come when we should set our faces like flint against every encroachment upon the sanctity of God's holy day.

When it is known that there are Seventh-day Adventist churches in Millington, and Rock Hall, Kent County, it is not very difficult to determine that unholy zeal and religious prejudice lie at the base of this "deprecation," and furnish the excuse for the consequent use of the words in the resolution, "whether such a violation is made in the name of religion."

These are some of the many cases which go to show the character of all religious worship which is not built upon a plain, "thus saith the Lord."
