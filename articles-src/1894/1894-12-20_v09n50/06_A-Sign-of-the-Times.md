[From "Great Controversy," a Seventh-day Adventist work, issued in 1860; Vol. 4, pp. 380-382, 387, 388, 409.]

ROMANISM is now regarded by Protestants with far greater favor than in former years. There is an increasing indifference concerning the doctrines that separate the reformed churches from the papal hierarchy; the opinion is gaining ground that, after all, we do not differ so widely upon vital points as has been supposed, and that a little concession on our part will bring us into a better understanding with Rome. The time was when Protestants placed a high value upon the liberty of conscience which has been so dearly purchased. They taught their children to abhor popery, and held that to remain at peace with Rome would be disloyalty to God. But how widely different are the sentiments now expressed.

The defenders of popery declare that she has been maligned; and the Protestant world is inclined to accept the statement. Many urge that it is unjust to judge the Romish Church of to-day by the abominations and absurdities that marked her reign during the centuries of ignorance and darkness. They excuse her horrible cruelty as the result of the barbarism of the times, and plead that civilization has changed her sentiments.

Have these persons forgotten the claim of infallibility for eight hundred years put forth by this haughty power? So far from relinquishing this claim, the church in the nineteenth century has affirmed it with greater positiveness than ever before. As Rome asserts that she has never erred, and never can err, how can she renounce the principles which governed her course in past ages?

The papal church will never relinquish her claim to infallibility. All that she has done in her persecution of those who reject her dogmas, she holds to be right; and would she not repeat the same acts, should the opportunity be presented? Let the restraints now imposed by secular governments be removed, and Rome be reinstated in her former power, and there would speedily be a revival of her tyranny and persecution.

It is true that there are real Christians in the Roman Catholic communion. Thousands in that church are serving God according to the best light they have. They are not allowed access to his Word, and therefore they do not discern the truth. They have never seen the contrast between a living heart-service and a round of mere forms and ceremonies. But God looks with pitying tenderness upon these souls, educated as they are in a faith that is delusive and unsatisfying. He will cause rays of light to penetrate the dense darkness that surrounds them. He will reveal to them the truth as it is in Jesus, and they will yet take their position with his people.

But Romanism as a system is no more in harmony with the gospel of Christ now than at any former period in her history. The Protestant churches are in great darkness, or they would discern the signs of the times.

Protestants have tampered with and patronized popery; they have made compromises and concessions which papists themselves are surprised to see, and fail to understand. Men are closing their eyes to the real character of Romanism, and the dangers to be apprehended from her supremacy. The people of our land need to be aroused to resist the advances of this most dangerous foe to civil and religious liberty.

Every principle of popery that existed in ages past exists to-day. The doctrines devised in the darkest ages are still held. Let none deceive themselves. The popery that Protestants are now so ready to honor and embrace is the same that ruled the world in the days of the Reformation, when men of God stood up at the peril of their lives to expose her iniquity. She possesses the same pride and arrogant assumption that lorded it over kings and princes, and claimed the prerogatives of God. Her spirit is no less cruel and despotic now than when she crushed out human liberty, and slew the saints of the Most High.

Popery is just what prophecy declared that she would be,—the apostasy of the later times. It is a part of her policy to assume the character which will best accomplish her purpose; but beneath the variable appearance of the chameleon, she conceals the invariable venom of the serpent. "We are not bound to keep faith and promises to heretics," she declares. Shall this power, whose record for a thousand years is written in the blood of the saints, be now acknowledged as a part of the Church of Christ?

It is not without reason that the claim has been put forth that Catholicism is now almost like Protestantism. There has been a change; but the change is not in Romanists. Catholicism indeed resembles the Protestantism that now exists; but it is far removed from Protestantism as it was in the days of Cranmer, Ridley, Knox, and other reformers.

As the Protestant churches have been seeking the favor of the world, false charity has blinded their eyes. They do not see but that it is right to believe good of all evil, and as the inevitable result, they will finally believe evil of all good. Instead of standing in defense of the faith once delivered to the saints, they are now, as it were, apologizing to Rome for their uncharitable opinion of her, begging pardon for their bigotry.

Through the two great errors, the immortality of the soul and Sunday observance, Satan will bring the people under his deceptions. While the former lays the foundation of Spiritualism, the latter creates a bond of sympathy with Rome. Protestantism will yet stretch her hand across the gulf to grasp the hand of Spiritualism; she will reach over the abyss to clasp hands with the Roman power; and under the influence of this threefold union, our country will follow in the steps of Rome in trampling on the rights of conscience.

FOR the first time in the history of the Union Theological Seminary, and probably for the first time in the history of any Protestant divinity school in this country, the lecture platform was occupied last evening by a priest of the Roman Catholic Church. It has been the custom during the past few years for the members of the Homiletical Society, an association of students of the senior class of the seminary, to invite clergymen of various denominations to address them at certain periods on subjects appertaining to the work of the ministry, to which the most prominent pulpit orators and thinkers of all shades of Protestant belief have responded. It was left, however, for this season's course of lectures to include one from a representative of the Roman Catholic Church, the Rev. Alexander P. Doyle, of the Paulist Fathers. The subject was, "Methods of Preaching."

When it had been determined to ask Father Doyle to address the students, the Rev. Dr. Briggs, Professor of Biblical Theology, was requested to extend the invitation to the Paulist, and did so. With the hearty assent of Archbishop Corrigan, the Rev. Father Doyle accepted.

Prof. Briggs presided, and introduced the lecturer in these words: "I take pleasure in introducing to you the Rev. Father Doyle. He represents the great preaching order of the Paulist Fathers. I knew the Rev. Father Hecker, the founder of the order, slightly. I have watched its progress with much interest. In my own mind it has done much more to elevate the character of preaching in the Roman Catholic Church than any other. I am glad to welcome Father Doyle here as the representative of the great Mother Church of Christendom, whose head recently issued a touching appeal for the reunion of the Church. It breathed a spirit like that of the Master himself."

Father Doyle said: "When the invitation came to me to address the Homiletical Society of the Union Theological Seminary, through my highly esteemed friend, Dr. Briggs, I felt it would not only be an error of judgment on my part to refuse it, but I would be guilty of neglect in my devotion to one of the great principles of my life, for it would be casting aside one of those rare opportunities of healing the breach of religious dissension and securing Christian unity. I have always made it a settled purpose to sit on the same platform with my brethren of other denominations whenever it was possible without sacrificing any principle of dogmatic faith. I felt constrained, therefore, to accept the invitation so generously accorded me, because I knew that the coming of a Catholic priest among you would be one more span added to that magnificent bridge that is being built in this age across the dark and muddy stream of religious intolerance.

"It goes without saying that all our religious misunderstandings and most of our religious antipathies arise from the fact that we do not know each other well enough. Ignorance of each other's opinions and want of appreciation of each other's motives have often led us to impute false ideas and extravagant notions to each other, while a better knowledge and broader charity would have united us in a common brotherhood. There is much that is in common between us like the solid mother earth that unites these two cities on either side of the East River, but there has been a stream running between us as swift, as dark, and, at times, as dangerous, as the river itself. It has had its shoals and hidden rocks of error, and it has been poisoned by the sewerage of religious prejudice, and it has been running strong and swift with its currents of misconception; but the day of building a great bridge came, and on the day that the bridge opened its wide arches for the people to pass and repass, on that day we conceived the Greater New York that was born of the vote of the people in the late elections.

"These are days of bridge-building over the streams of religious prejudice, and as I used to boast that I passed over the Brooklyn Bridge before there was any bridge there, when only one cable was laid and a little footpath over it, so I rejoice to-night that mine is the pleasure to be the first to pass over the bridge of religious toleration and join hands with you in Christian unity."
