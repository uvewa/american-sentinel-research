The pastor of a Christian Church in Missouri sends us the following excellent letter:—

Nevada, Mo., July 19, 1894.

Encloses American Sentinel,—I have received a sample copy of your paper with a tract entitled "The Civil Sabbath," by the kindness of some friend.

I have read the copy, and take this method to say to you that I am in sympathy with every move away from religious legislation.

No government has a natural right to dictate religious duty, much less a free government like that of the United States. Christianity is natural government. State government is arbitrary. To unite these must bring persecution and destruction. That the present status of our civilization is precarious, no one abreast of the times can for one moment doubt. God made man free, and he who proposes to arbitrarily rule him is a usurper and claims divine prerogatives.

I am for freedom in religious thought and action. Truth unfettered by human law will triumph in the end, and we can afford to wait the coming of the truth religiously, as well as we have waited for scientific truth.

Yours in the love of truth and freedom.

This letter is encouraging to us, and will be also to the person who sent the paper and tract referred to. They were not sent from this office, and we take this method of letting the friend who sent them know how they were received. We very frequently receive letters of this character from those who have had through others copies of the SENTINEL. Be not weary, friends, in well-doing, even if you get no immediate return.
