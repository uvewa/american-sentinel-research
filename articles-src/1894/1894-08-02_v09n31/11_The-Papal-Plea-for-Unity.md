The Roman pontiff has issued an "encyclical" in behalf of Church unity, which is remarkable in that it is addressed to all Christendom,—Protestant, Greek, and Roman Catholic. The fact affords strong evidence of the feeling of confidence which pervades the Roman hierarchy at this stage of their struggle for the recovery of Rome's former supremacy. It is said that the pope was previously in possession of reliable assurances both from Greek and Anglican Church parties that such a plea from himself would be welcomed in their midst; though doubtless the ever increasing flow of the Romeward tide in so-called Protestant churches throughout Christendom, furnished the pontiff with all the evidence needed that his effort would not be in vain.

The papal plea for unity is, of course, nothing more than a plea for union with Rome. No other kind of unity is desired or recognized by the papal church. The pontiff has deliberately invited the Protestant bodies throughout the world to acknowledge the authority of the church of Rome in spiritual things, and to declare that the reformation was wrong and that Wycliffe, Luther, Wesley, and their collaborators were agents of the devil, instead of servants of God. An Italian, surrounded by others of his kind, brought up in an atmosphere that knows never a ray of gospel light and liberty, invites those who have been reared in the atmosphere of freedom to acknowledge him as their spiritual leader! But on the other hand, the insult has itself been invited by the inconsistent, compromising, and spiritually-lifeless character of the Protestantism which a great part of the Protestant world has now for some years exhibited.

The basis of the desired union is, as stated, an acknowledgment by all other churches of the authority of Rome, of the error of all doctrines which stand in opposition to hers, and of the wickedness of the work of all by whom such doctrines have been taught; for this is what a compliance with the pope's proposition involves. It is not Christian unity for which the pontiff pleads, but for the "unity of Christendom," in that sense of the word which refers more to a profession of Christ than to possession of what he gives. Christian unity is, "the unity of the faith" (Eph. 4: [3:])—not unity of belief merely, nor unity which men can bring about with respect to the faith, but unity which the faith itself gives to men, as many as will receive it. Faith—Christian faith—is a gift of God, and not an outcome of the will or reason of man (Eph. 2:8); and Christian unity is the result of the faith which they have, and not of any efforts on their part to agree on points of doctrine while in a state of discord. There being but one faith, there must necessarily be unity among all who possess it. All who are united to Christ are by that very bond united to each other. And therefore no anxiety need ever be felt by any one for Christian unity itself, for that must always exist wherever there are Christians; and the very fact that a plea is put forth for the unity of Christendom is itself proof that it is not Christian unity that is called for, but only such unity as can be produced by the will and efforts of man.

The encyclical declares, as stated in the Catholic Times, that "the church continues with an ardor that knows no abatement the work of propagating the faith which has lived through nineteen centuries,"—in which assertion there is more of truth stated than is realized by the pope or his defenders; for what he miscalls "faith" has, in its Catholic phase, existed since the days of the Apostle Paul, who saw the beginning of its working nineteen centuries ago (see 2 Thess. 2:7); but the Christian faith is very much older than that, for "by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous" (Heb. 11:4); and the gospel was preached to Abraham (Gal. 3:8); and to his descendants who came out of Egypt. Heb. 4:1, 2. The Christian faith is as old as the days when God first spoke to man, for faith is belief of God's Word, and we read in the first Epistle of Peter, "the word of the Lord endureth forever, and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you." The gospel is everlasting (Rev. 14:6); and therefore the Christian faith,—the faith which God gives to man,—is everlasting; it has been prepared from eternity. The doctrines of the papacy are, in principle, older than nineteen centuries, extending back into the darkness of ancient heathenism until they become lost in the mists of time; but in their Christian guise they have existed for nineteen centuries and no more.

The pope offers himself to the Protestant world as an infallible religious guide, since they have, as he informs them, uncertain rule of faith nor authority. In other words since the word of the Lord, which by the gospel is preached unto men is not a sure rule of faith nor authority to them, the pope offers them the word of man, preached by the prelates of Rome! Bad indeed it is that the attitude of professed Protestants should invite such a

deliverance from the "man of sin." The root of this terrible evil is neglect of the words of God,—the holy Scriptures. Turning away from them and refusing to accept them in childlike faith, they have indeed no certain rule of faith nor authority left them, but have only the dire remedy for their schisms of going back to Rome. But "nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal: The Lord knoweth them that are his." 2 Tim. 2:19.—Present Truth, London, England.
