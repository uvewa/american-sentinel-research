In a sermon preached in Wilmington, Del., May 20, Rev. T. E. Terry, pastor of St. Paul's Methodist Episcopal Church, thus defined the term, "A Christian Nation":

There is a decided and growing tendency among the masses of our population toward irreverence for the sacred institutions of Christianity, and toward positive irreligion. No nation can be truly said to be a Christian nation that has not a distinct national type of Christian morality. If this nation is equally given up to the doubts of skepticism, to the denials of agnosticism and infidelity, to a multitude of pagan beliefs and to no belief at all, and to belief in Jesus Christ, then it cannot in truth be said to be a Christian nation. A Christian nation must be a nation acknowledging Jesus Christ, and adopting his religion. This national morality cannot exist without religious principles and religious institutions. Wherever Rome carried her conquests there she set up her standards and established her laws, and that province became a part of the great Roman Empire. So, wherever Christianity prevails, there she must set up her standards and establish her institutions, and so long as she stays to bless the nation these must remain intact. But what are the facts? Where in all this land is the sanctity of the holy Sabbath not violated? Who does not know that the respect and reverence that men entertain for the Church and for the Christian ministry is sadly waning? With what Sippant irreverence do men handle the Word of God? and yet let it ever be borne in mind that without the Christian Sabbath, and the Christian Church, and the Christian's Bible—without all of these sacredly cherished and immorably fixed as the foundations of our civilization, America is not, cannot be in any true sense a Christian nation, and he who in any way, and to any extent impairs the strength and influence of these or either of them, or in any way lessens the respect and veneration men feel for them, to that extent he digs away the foundations of our Republic, and forfeits the protection and goodness of God. Let him who sins against God, and against the Christian conscience of this nation beware!

Notice, "A Christian nation must be a nation acknowledging Jesus Christ and adopting his religion." "Wherever Rome carried her conquests there she set up her standards and established her laws." And this man, who is called a Christian minister, sets this forth as an example of what the Church should do: do as Rome did: conquer by force and promulgate its religion by the sword!
