The Albany correspondent of a city paper announces that the Committee on Charities of the Constitutional Convention has changed its opinion regarding the withdrawal of State aid from sectarian charitable institutions. At the beginning it says the majority of the committee believed that none of the State's money should be paid to these institutions. Now the opinion of all the members but one is that the present system should not be changed, because the members have been convinced by personal observation "that the purely State institutions—those that are maintained absolutely at the expense of the State—are the poorest and most incompetently managed, and that the sectarian institutions—those that succeed in deriving a certain stipend per capita from the State—are most commendably controlled."

Assuming this statement to be correct, we submit that it furnishes no reason why State money should continue to go to substantially private asylums over which the State has not any control. If the State's institutions are inferior to the others that is the fault of the State, and it is not a reason for continuing a system of diverting public money to the support of private and sectarian institutions. The machine which has dominated the Democratic party of our State has undoubtedly demoralized the asylums and hospitals which the State conducts. The remedy is not to continue the payment of public money to private institutions, but to elect a governor who will reform the management of these institutions. No other course is logical.

If the committee has concluded that the present system of giving public money to private sectarian institutions is right it might as well go further and recommend the abandonment of State hospitals and asylums, and turn over the unfortunate to the care of sectarian asylums, protectories, schools and hospitals at public cost, but without public oversight. Why not? If the sectarians do so much better than the State can do with some institutions, would they not do better with all?

A large number of the people of the State desire an opportunity to vote upon a proposition to abolish all sectarian appropriations. If the members of the committee, who have seen some sectarian institutions at their best, and under circumstances that are not normal, think to deny the people this right, they will not perform their duty.—Mail and Express.
