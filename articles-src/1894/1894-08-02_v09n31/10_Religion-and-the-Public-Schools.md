The Committee on Education of the Constitutional Convention at Albany proposes an amendment to the constitution absolutely forbidding any sort of State aid, direct or indirect, of schools "wholly or partly under the control of any religious denomination, or in which any denominational tenet or doctrine is taught."

This makes complete the secularization of the system of public education in this State. If such an amendment be adopted by the convention and ratified by the people, all attempts of religious or parochial schools to participate in the distribution of the public school fund will be frustrated permanently by the positive prohibition of the fundamental law. It would, moreover, exclude from the public schools every trace of religious education, prayer, reading of the Bible, or any formal recognition of supernatural religion, for in whatever shape such instruction is introduced it must take on the character of "denominational tenet or doctrine."

Under the English system of State aid to primary education, voluntary and denominational schools are recognized as a part of the public provision for instruction, but these are supplemented by separate schools, especially established by the school boards, which are empowered to make their own arrangements respecting religious teaching, subject to the restriction that it shall not be denominational. Where it is provided, however, it is Christian, and generally, in the Roman Catholic view, Protestant. Of the 2,392 school boards in England and Wales, only 91 have excluded religious instruction altogether, and these are wholly in small villages. In all the rest the Bible is read and careful provision is made for inculcating religion. Birmingham is almost alone among them in going even so far as to require that the Bible shall be read without note or comment. In London the school board has always provided for the reading of the Bible and "such explanations and such instructions therefrom in the principles of morality and religion as are suited to the capacities of children;" but last April it went further and laid down a scheme of dogmatic religious teaching, justly described by a writer in the last number of the Nineteenth Century magazine as "a creed of its own, designed to serve as a new safeguard of the faith, and to render all Unitarian and other heterodox interpretations of the Bible impossible."

The scheme satisfies neither the teachers nor the public, and, generally, the religious instruction of the board schools satisfies neither believers nor unbelievers. As Lord Salisbury calls it, it is "a patent compressible religion which can be forced into all consciences with a little squeezing." He has also declared with the force of irrefutable truth that "no State necessity ought to allow you to sweep away" a parent's "inalienable right to determine the teaching which his child should receive upon the holiest and most momentous of all subjects." That right cannot be guarded except by excluding all religious instruction from schools provided and controlled by the State. The logical outcome of the controversy provoked by the course of the London School Board last spring in laying out a scheme of dogmatic religious instruction will be the complete secularization of the London schools maintained by the board. If the State desires to encourage such teaching, it must do so, after the English plan, by treating every elementary school, voluntary or religious, as a public school. In its own schools, specifically, it must let religion alone, or else it invades an inalienable right of the parent, as Lord Salisbury says.

The proposed amendment to the Constitution of this State would absolutely forbid the adoption of that plan here. All schools which gave religious instruction would be debarred from State aid by its prohibition. The Faribault plan would be unconstitutional in New York. The public money would be expended for purely secular education exclusively.—New York Sun.
