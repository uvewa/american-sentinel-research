The Christian Reformer, Pittsburg, says:—

The persistent and systematic efforts to make the weekly day of rest and worship a day of secular enjoyment, are meeting with remarkable success. On Saturday the daily papers publish the attractions offered in the public parks on the Sabbath, and hold out every form of inducement to the people to forsake the churches and go to the parks for a day or an evening of pleasure. Bands of music are engaged to add to the attractions offered. On Monday the papers tell what multitudes of people spent the Sabbath in the parks, and how they enjoyed themselves and were benefited. It is said that at least 40,000 people were in Schenley Park, Pittsburg, on Sabbath, June 10th. These people who are shot up from morning till night in offices, shops, business houses, and kitchens, certainly need the advantages afforded by the parks. But it is a great wrong done to their own souls to use the Sabbath to obtain that advantage. There are six days for secular, and one day for sacred, employments. It is an outrage on humanity to spend the whole of six days in shops, and mills, and stores, without necessary recreation, and then to rob the soul of its rights that the tired body may be recuperated. Let there be a Saturday half holiday for bodily recreation. "Verily ye shall keep my Sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary."

"Verily ye shall keep my Sabbaths!" How does the Reformer do this? By calling God's Sabbath "Saturday," and urging men to give half of it to business, and half to holidayism. The Reformer treats God's Sabbath with greater disregard, if possible, than those, of whom it complains, do Sunday, and adds to this profaning of God's day the false claim

that it is justified in so doing because prevailing custom and majority rule are with it in such disregard. It sets an example of godlessness by its treatment of the real Sabbath, and then denounces those who follow its example in general by disregarding both the Sabbath and Sunday. Physician, heal thyself. Cease your disobedience to God, and teach men to revere this law, the authority of which surpasses human custom, as light surpasses darkness, as the mountain peak surpasses the marshy plains. Until such leaders as the Reformer are reformed the "remarkable success" which now attends the destruction of Sunday will continue to be increasingly successful.—Evangel and Sabbath Outlook.
