AND NOW LET THE NATIONAL REFORMERS RISE UP IN THEIR WRATH AND PRONOUNCE CURSES BOTH LOUD AND DEEP ON THE RATION: THE ATTORNEY FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HAS DECIDED THAT ORDINARILY THE WORD "DAILY" WOULD NOT INCLUDE SUNDAY, THAT BEING A DIES NON, BUT THAT IN THE MATTER OF REMOVING GARBAGE IT MEANS JUST WHAT IT SAYS. "GARBAGE IS ACCUMULATED ON SUNDAY AS WELL AS ON OTHER DAYS," Writes MR. THOMAS, "AND SINCE ITS PRESENCE IS JUST AS OBJECTIONABLE TO HEALTH ON SUNDAYS AS ON OTHER DAYS, THE WORD 'DAILY,' IT SEEMS TO ME, MUST BE CONSIDERED AS USED IN THE CONTRACT WITH REFERENCE TO THE SERVICE TO BE PERFORMED, AND MUST, THEREFORE, IN THE NATURE OF THINGS, INCLUDE SUNDAYS."

NOW LET MR. CRAFTS DECLARE THAT THE RATION CANNOT BE PRESERVED WITHOUT RELIGION, NOR RELIGION WITHOUT THE SABBATH, NOR THE SABBATH WHILE THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA REMOVES ITS GARBAGE UPON SUNDAY. LET DR. GEORGE RENEW HIS ONSLACHT OF CONGRESS, AND LET JOSEPH COOK EXPAND HIS BROAD PALM AND CLOSING HIS FINGERS ONE BY ONE, CLINCH THE SUNDAY ARGUMENT IN THIS MOST UNHAPPY AND INCONCLUSIVE WAY.
