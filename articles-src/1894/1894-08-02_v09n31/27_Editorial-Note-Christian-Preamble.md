THE NATIONAL REFORM ASSOCIATION HAS ONE OF ITS SECRETARIES AT ALBANY TRYING TO SECURE THE ADOPTION OF A SO-CALLED "CHRISTIAN" PREAMBLE TO THE NEW CONSTITUTION. THE PRESENT PREAMBLE READS THUS:—

WE, THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, GRATEFUL TO ALMIGHTLY GOD FOR OUR FREEDOM, IN ORDER TO SECURE ITS BLEEDING, DO ESTABLISH THIS CONSTITUTION.

IT WOULD SEEM THAT THIS OUGHT TO SATISFY EVEN A NATIONAL REFORMER, BUT IT DON'T, AND SO MR. WEIR, A CITIZEN OF PENNSYLVANIA, WANTS THIS ADOPTED IN ITS STEAD:—

WE, THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, GRATEFUL

TO ALMIGHTLY GOD FOR OUR FREEDOM, IN ORDER TO SECURE ITS BLEEDING, AS A CHRISTIAN PEOPLE IN THE NAME AND BY THE AUTHORITY OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST, ON WHOSE SHOULDER IS THE GOVERNMENT, DO ESTABLISH THIS CONSTITUTION.

THIS IS MONSTRONS. TO BEGIN WITH, THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE ARE NOT, PROPERLY SPEAKING, TRACKFUL TO GOD FOR FREEDOM; THEY ARE NOT, IN ANY PROPER SENSE, A "CHRISTIAN PEOPLE;" AND CERTAINLY AS LONG AS TAMMANY BEARS RULE, THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW YORK IS NOT ON CHRIST'S SHOULDER. LET NO LIE BE INCORPORATED INTO OUR FUNDAMENTAL LAW. LET THE OLD PREAMBLE STAND; OR BETTER YET, SUBSTITUTE THIS:—

WE, THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, IN ORDER TO SECURE ITS CUCERIES AND OUR PROSPECTLY OF BENEFITS OF GOOD AND STABLE GOVERNMENT, DO ESTABLISH THIS CONSTITUTION.
