THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN SAYS THAT THE GOVERNMENT, BY ITS MAIL CONTRATS, REQUIRES "HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS TO SET AT Naught THE LAW OF THE MOST HIGH," IN THE SUNDAY MAIL SERVICE. WILL THE STATESMAN PLEASE TO BE MORE DEFINITE AND POINT OUT THE DIVINE LAW WHICH PROHIBITS THE CARRYING OF MAIL ON SUNDAY? OUR CONTEMPORARY MOST REALIZE THAT THE CLAIMS OF THE SUNDAY SABBATH ARE AT A GREAT DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE WITHOUT THE VESTIGE OF BIBLICAL AUTHORITY. WHAT WOULD NOT THE WHOLE NATIONAL REFORM OUTFIT GIVE FOR ONE "THUS SAITH THE LORD" FOR SUNDAY OBSERVANCE? BUT THEY HAVE IT NOT. THE WEALTH OF THE WORLD COULD NOT BUY IT, AND SO THEY MUST CONTINUE TO STEAL THE LIVERY OF HEAVEN IN WHICH TO SERVE THE PAGAN SUNDAY. OH, THE WICKEDNESS OF APPLYING THE FOURTH COMMANDMENT TO SUNDAY!
