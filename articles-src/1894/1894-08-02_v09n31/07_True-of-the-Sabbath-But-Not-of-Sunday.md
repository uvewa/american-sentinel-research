[The Christian Statesman has the following words, sound and true when applied to the Sabbath, but false as applied to Sunday. Have men no fear of God before their eyes that they can thus pervert the truth and give to a base counterfeit the honor claimed by God for his own rest day?]

Our complex civilization makes it difficult, we concede, to determine just what is, and what is not, proper to be done on the Sabbath day. But our unwillingness to make sacrifices for conscience' sake adds greatly to that difficulty. There are some kinds of work one cannot do if he would live a loyal Christian life. Because our complex civilization calls for the operation of the telephone, for example, does not prove that that call is right and should be obeyed by the Christian. It may only be another call to sacrifice for Christ's sake. "The Sabbath will be observed as the Lord of the Sabbath would have it observed only when all men humbly ask God to direct their observance of it, and then go straightway and do what he tells them to do." But how will he direct them? Will it be by some new revelation or by the word of truth? Has God spoken so distinctly and definitely that one may be sure of his mind? If one shall take the fourth commandment as fundamental and then all that is found elsewhere in the Bible on the Sabbath question as complementary, with a sincere desire to know and to do "what he believes the Lord would have him do," will he not be likely to become an enlightened and loyal Sabbath-keeper? Is there any other safe way for one to do in a matter surrounded with so many difficulties? Let us be careful that our instruction is such that those who follow it will build on the bed rock. Nothing else is safe.
