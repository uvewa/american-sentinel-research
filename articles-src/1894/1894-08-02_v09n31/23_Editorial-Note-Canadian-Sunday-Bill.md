ON ANOTHER PAGE WE BEGIN THE PUBLICATION OF A SPEECH BY HON. G. AMYOT, A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, CANADA, AGAINST THE PASSAGE OF A SUNDAY BILL, ENTITLED, "AN ACT TO SECURE THE BETTER OBSERVANCE OF THE LORD'S DAY, COMMONLY CALLED SUNDAY." A NOTABLE FEATURE OF THE SPEECH IS MR. AMYOT'S RECOGNITION OF THE VITAL QUESTION AT STALK IN SUNDAY OBSERVANCE. HE DECLARES THAT THE MAN WHO ATTEMPTS TO ENFORCE SUNDAY OBSERVANCE BY LAW UNDERTAKES "TO COMPET A GREAT NUMBER OF HIS FELLOW-CITIZENS TO DISOBEY THE WORD OF GOD AND TO OBEY THE WORDS OF THE CHURCH OF WHICH THEY DO NOT APPROVE." THIS IS THE SITUATION IN A NUTSHELL; AND

RATHER THAN THUS PROVE DISLOYAL TO THEIR GOD, SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS CHOOSE TO SUFFER IN PRISONS, IN CHAIN-GANGS, AND IN EXILE.
