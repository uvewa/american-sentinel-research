The Indian appropriation bill occupied the attention of the Senate July 18. It was considered for five hours and then went over without final action. It appropriates about $9,500,000 an increase over the amount appropriated last year of $1,500,000.

The bill gave rise to no discussion except when the paragraph appropriating $1,000,000 for the Indian schools was reached. Mr. Quay then presented a large number of papers, printed in uniform style and language, numerously signed by citizens of various counties in Pennsylvania, and headed, "A petition concerning appropriations for Indian education at sectarian schools."

The paper protests "against the violation of the American principle of separation of Church and State" involved in the pending bill. He said that the petitions came from the Patriotic Sons of America, and he moved that the further consideration of the bill be postponed for two weeks, so that the patriotic orders of the country might be heard from. The motion was rejected, and the consideration of the bill was proceeded with.

Mr. Gallinger, of New Hampshire, referred to what he called the remarkable fact that within the last eight years the Catholic Church received $2,366,000 for the education of Indian children, while fifteen other churches had received only a little more than half of that amount. It was not to be wondered at, therefore, he said, that the other churches had come to the conclusion that it was time to come back to the principle that Church and State ought to be divorced.

Mr. Call on behalf of himself and of the committee, concurred in the propriety of a separation between Church and State; but explained that as the matter had come down to the present administration the committee had no discretion in the matter, unless it recommended the entire discon

tinuance of education of Indian children as now provided for.

Mr. Gallinger expressed the belief that these school appropriations were in contravention of the spirit, if not the letter, of the Constitution. He did not believe that Congress could long stand on the ground which it occupied to-day. There was already a gathering storm against appropriating money for sectarian purposes, and that storm would break before a great while. The principle was wrong and had to be reversed sooner or later—and the sooner the better.

Mr. Call said that the senator from New Hampshire did not differ on that point from the Committee on Appropriations, nor did the committee differ from him. He knew that the public opinion of the country was opposed to sectarian schools. But the question was, what could the Committee on Appropriations do? These contracts had been made and these contract schools established. Ought the children to be taken away from them?

An item of $1,000 for the repair of the church and building used for school purposes on the San Xavier reservation, in Arizona, led to a statement by Mr. Cockrell, of Missouri, chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, that this was an old Greek Church, probably the oldest church in the United States, not even excepting that at Santa Fe; that it was a work of rare skill in architecture, and that the real object of the appropriation was to preserve it as one of the antiquities of the country.—Washington Post.
