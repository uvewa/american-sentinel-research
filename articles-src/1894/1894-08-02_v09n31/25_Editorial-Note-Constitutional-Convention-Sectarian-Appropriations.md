THE COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION OF THE NEW YORK STATE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION HAVING IN CHARGE THE PROPOSED SECTION DESIGNED TO PREVENT SECTARIAN APPROPRIATIONS, HAS REPORTED TEN TO THREE IN ITS FAVOR, TO THE CONVENTION. IT READS AS FOLLOWS:—

NEITHER THE STATE NOR ANY SUB-DIVISION THEREOF SHALL USE ITS PROPERTY OR CREDIT OR ANY PUBLIC MOONEY, OR AUTHORIZE OR PERMIT EITHER TO BE USED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN AND OR MAINTENANCE OF SCHOOL OR OTHER INSTITUTIONS OF LEARNING, WHOLLY OR PARTLY UNDER THE DIRECTION OR CONTROL OF ANY RELIGIOUS DENOMINATION, OR IN WHICH ANY DENOMINATIONAL TENET OR DOCTRINE IS Taught.

IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THIS LEAVES THE DOOR WIDE OPEN FOR THAT COLORLESS THING CALLED "UNSECTARIAN RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION." THAT WHICH IS HELD IN COMMON BY A NUMBER OF DENOMINATIONS IS NOT GENERALLY REGARDED AS DENOMINATIONAL, THOUGH IN FACT IT IS SO WHETHER HELD BY ONE DENOMINATION OR BY FORTY.
