The commandment is a lamp and the law is light. Prov. 6:23. Christ was the true light. John 1:9. His life was the light of men—that is, the light or law that was in his heart (Ps. 40:8) was manifested through his life. Now our Saviour says to us, he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life (John 8:12), or the law in our hearts. How is this?

Love is the fulfilling of the law. Rom. 13:10. Love cannot fail to render entire obedience just as far as the law is understood. But the natural, carnal mind is enmity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. Rom. 8:7. In order to keep God's holy, just and good law, the carnal heart must be changed; right here we begin to realize our helplessness, for when we would do good evil is present with us, and we cry out: O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from this body of death? With Paul, it is our blessed privilege to thank God for victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Rom. 7:12, 21, 24, 25. He it is who says to us, Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness and all your idols will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments (laws), and do them. Eze. 36:25-27.

The love of God is then shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given us. Rom. 5:5. The Lord puts his laws into our minds and writes them in our hearts. Heb. 8:10. And the love which is in our hearts makes the law a great delight, we exclaim with David: "Oh, how love I thy law!"

Does the Lord do all this without our cooperation? Oh no; by grace are ye saved through faith. Eph. 2:8. The grace, unmerited favor, of God, does the work; but our faith first sees and accepts his promise to do it. We shall receive no more than our faith grasps. Having been sanctified by the very God of peace, he preserves us blameless, actually keeping his whole law unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Thess. 5:23. This is true Christian liberty—freedom from sin. If we do the will of God we have the precious privilege of committing the keeping of our souls to him in well-doing (that is, keeping his royal law), as unto a faithful Creator. 1 Peter 4:19. Peter does not call him merely a Preserver; God creates the souls of those who trust him in well-doing, more and more into his own divine image.
