It is a matter which must cause sorrow and shame to every true Protestant that the Protestantism of to-day is going back on the noble stand made by the reformers in the sixteenth century, which gave birth to Protestantism itself. The protest of those noble men at the Diet of Spires in 1529 contained the very essence of Protestantism, and gave to the reformed church its name.

But this protest was a disavowal of the theory that the State should have supervision of religion or anything to do with religion. They said, "In matters of conscience, the majority [the State] has no power." And this is yet true Protestant principle. But it is a matter of deep regret to see many of those churches which claim to be Protestant repudiating this principle, and advocating the enforcement of certain religious customs, such as Sunday observance, by law; the teaching of religion by the State, and the appropriation of government funds to religious and sectarian purposes. This is a virtual repudiation of Protestantism, and the adoption of the papal theory bodily.

True Protestantism is not simply a protesting against the Romish Church having anything to say about governmental affairs or receiving governmental aid, but at the same time attempting to dictate to the government, and doing all in its power to receive State aid itself. No: this is not genuine Protestantism in any sense of the word, but simply another papacy under another name. True Protestantism repudiates the principle of any Church and State union whatever, irrespective of what government or what church it may be. It says that the consciences of men are above the State, and that the religion of Jesus Christ is not in need of State aid.

To say that there should be no connection between the Romish Church and the State, but that Protestantism should be the favored religion, is not a repudiation of Church and State union. It is simply to argue that the State should decide between the various religions in the world as to which is true and false, and champion the one selected as the true. But this is simply the idea of the bigot, and not of the man who esteems the religion he professes as too sacred to become connected with the State, or to be submitted to any such test in determining whether it be the genuine or not. It is the same style of reasoning that Macaulay refers to in his essay on "Sir James Mackintosh." He says:—

The doctrine which, from the very first origin of religious dissensions, has been held by all bigots of all sects, when condensed into a few words, and stripped of rhetorical disguise, is simply this: I am in the right, and you are in the wrong. When you are the stronger, you ought to tolerate me; for it is your duty to tolerate truth. But when I am the stronger, I shall persecute you; for it is my duty to persecute error.

But the doctrine of the reformer is that the State is ordained for the government and protection of all the people, irrespective of their attitude toward religion; and that all religions should stand upon an equal footing as regards the State, none favored, none suppressed, but all free to be propagated and believed or disbelieved by the people as they may see fit. This is the only sure antidote to Church and State union with all its evil results. It is neither tolerance nor a doctrine born of indifference to religion, but one born from a sense of equality and true liberty.—Bible Echo, Melbourne, Aus.
