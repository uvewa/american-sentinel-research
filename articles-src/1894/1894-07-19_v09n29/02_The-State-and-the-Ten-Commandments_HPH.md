The Lord made the earth, and as Creator he is Proprietor. He has not given any man or nation a monopoly of the world, but has created all men free and equal, and holds all responsible for doing his will. Those that do his will are given eternal life, while those that do not, perish. God's will is expressed in the ten commandments, hence it is every man's right to keep these commandments.

If a community of men associated together in a State forbids its citizens to keep these commandments, or makes laws which render it impossible to keep them without loss in fines or imprisonment, it then becomes a question with the individual of obeying God or man. Under such circumstances, the man that is true in obedience to God is compelled by the State to stand in society as a transgressor, and is punished as such. By making laws that produce such conditions, the State exceeds its province in that it takes from man a right that God has bestowed upon all alike.

According to the Scriptures, the province of the State is to punish evil doers, and not those that do well. Rom. 13:1-3. By keeping God's commandments one is doing well, not evil, and should have praise of the State instead of punishment. In making laws that hinder its citizens from keeping the commandments, the State sets itself up in direct opposition to God. It forbids and punishes as evil what God pronounces good and the duty of all men.

This is precisely what is brought about by Sunday laws. Such laws make it impossible to keep the ten commandments without suffering under the pious-gloved hand of the State as an evil-doer, for God's law requires men to keep the seventh day (Saturday) and work the other six days. Men may say that Sunday-keeping is meant to fulfill this Sabbath law; but it does not. God's law plainly says the seventh day, and what right have we to make such wholesale changes in the divine law? To assume the right to change the law is to claim to be above the law giver. The papacy claims the right to change God's law; and for this reason the Bible represents the papacy as exalting itself above God. 2 Thess. 2:1-4. Any power, civil or ecclesiastical, that takes the same course is guilty of the same sin; and God solemnly warns men against doing it.

In civil courts the judge holds to the letter of the law; he will not allow one word to be changed, and is careful to get at the true meaning of every word. If man is thus particular with his own law, should he be less so with God's? Or, if while he is so exact with his own law, he allows, and even advises, wholesale changes in God's law without God's sanction, does he not show much more regard for his own law than God's? And if Christians consent to such a course, are they not equally guilty? God's law is binding on all men, whether they acknowledge it or not; all will be judged by it, and eternal life depends on standing in this judgment. Can we hope to stand if we knowingly change this law, and live according to our change in preference to God's plain requirement?

In proportion as one values eternal life, he will jealously cling to the letter of this law. If men make laws which require him to depart from the explicit command of God, he is called upon to choose between obeying God or men. To obey men under such circumstances is to do it at the peril of eternal life. By clinging to the letter of God's law the individual does not endanger the interests of the State; on the contrary, his course is for the good of the State. It is possible for the State to make such laws as would lead to its own ruin, and it is the duty of every true friend of the State to oppose such laws. If he does so by refusing to obey in order to keep God's commandments, and suffers punishment in consequence, he becomes a martyr to protect the true interests of the State.

All laws enacted by the State infringing one's right to keep God's law according to his word are against the interests of the State and should be opposed by every true citizen for two reasons. First, because he cannot endanger his eternal interests by not exercising his right to keep God's commandments; and second, because he desires the good and the preservation of the State.
