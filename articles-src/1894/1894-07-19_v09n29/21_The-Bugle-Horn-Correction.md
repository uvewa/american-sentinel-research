THE Bugle Horn, "for prohibition and equal suffrage," published at Salamanca, this State, says:—

If a person were to read the AMERICAN SENTINEL, he would be led to conclude that there was only one commandment, and that for the observance of the Sabbath. . . . Are there not other things in the Decalopoe? Where are the nine? By what right does the SENTINEL select one, as above the rest?

This is too bad! but we can scarcely blame the editor of the Bugle Horn, for he has only judged us by himself. Evidently he has forgotten, at least one of the commandments. Without doubt he has overlooked the commandment which says, "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor." Will our contemporary please bear in mind that there are ten commandments? and that "whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all"? It is just as wicked to lie as it is to steal. We have never intended to be partial in the law, but have especially emphasized the fourth commandment because it is specially disregarded. Does not the editor of the Bugle Horn conduct a prohibition paper for a similar reason?—Certainly. Why then does he "darken counsel without knowledge"?
