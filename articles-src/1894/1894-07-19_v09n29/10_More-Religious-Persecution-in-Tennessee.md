The following statement of facts is from the appendix to No. 16 of the *Religious Liberty Library*, recently issued:—

**Religious Persecution in Tennessee.**

FLOWING A TURNIP FAUTH ON SUNDAY IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIELD OF FULL-BROWN CORN SENDS AN INOFFENSIVE CITIZEN TO JAIL FOR OVER A YEAR.

On June 26, 1894, W. B. Capps was locked up in the county jail at Dresden, Weekley County, Tenn.; for performing common labor on his farm on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday.

The first time he was seen at work, he was cutting corn stalks in his own field. The witness's farm is adjoining, and he could see Mr. Capps at work from his house a few hundred yards away. This was on a Sunday, in May, 1892.

In the fall of the same year the same witness went to Mr. Capps's house on Sunday to see him about a note on which he was surety, and found him plowing a piece of uncoltivated land in the middle of a field of grown corn, in which he designed to sow turnips. The witness informed Mr. Capps that his father, the payee, expected him to send the money, though in his testimony the witness denied that he went to see the defendant about the note. This secluded spot in which Mr. Capps was quietly following the loadings of his conscience by tilling the soil on the first day of the week, was not only shut in by full-grown corn, but was three quarters of a mile from any public road.

At another time Mr. Capps was seen on Sunday splitting rails. Before the day was over, two of his neighbors came along, took up the manl and ax, and assisted him for a time. The neighbors were not interfered with in their liberty.

Mr. Capps was arrested June 8, 1893, and at his trial before the Circuit Court of Weekley County, June 27, 1893, he was fined $10 and costs, amounting in all to $51.80. His case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Tennessee, which affirmed the judgment of the lower court, May 24, 1894, at Jackson, fixing the costs at $58.69; making as a grand total the catrageous sum of $110.45, to be served out by the criminal (?) at the paltry rate of twenty-five cents per day. This will necessitate the confinement of the prisoner 443 days, or one year and nearly three months.

The Supreme Court did not write any opinion, but simply said: "There is no controversy as to the facts in this case [as of course there was not], and we find no error in the record; therefore the judgment of the court below will be affirmed." It gave no reasons, and did not attempt to meet the convincing arguments raised by the defense. Plainly the principles contended for by the defense are correct, and cannot be controverted.

Mr. Capps has a wife twenty-four years of age, and four children, the eldest being only six years old, and one of them sick at the time of its father's imprisonment. His family is left all alone in the woods a quarter of a mile from any house. He is a poor man and unable to support his family during his confinement. He does not deny working on Sunday, but did so because he had rested the day before according to the Bible, because he recognized his (lod-given right to labor six days in the week, beginning on the first, as did his Creator; and because in acceding to the demands of the State to rest on Sunday, he would be denying his Lord.

Hence he refuses to pay the fine and costs, regarding them unjust, since the State is attempting to enforce upon him a dogma of religion, with which it can of right have nothing whatever to do. Therefore he has gone to jail, though a physician stated that he could never live in that unhealthy place the time required by the enormity of the State's assessment.

Where is a clearer case of religious persecution?

---

The facts stated in this leaflet should be known by everybody. It is indeed a clear case of religious persecution; but the fact that the work done by Mr. Capps was at a distance from any public road and not in a place likely to be observed really cuts no figure in the matter. Mr. Capps, or anybody else for that matter, whether an observer of the seventh day or not, has just as much right to work on Sunday as anybody else has to work on any other day. Of course, everybody should at all times do as they would be done by, and this Mr. Capps does: he works when he pleases and is willing that others should do the same. But as Mr. Capps' neighbors want him to refrain from work when they do, they ought likewise to rest whenever Mr. Capps does. Mr. Capps does not work on Saturday, the seventh day, the Sabbath of the Lord. Now, if he must rest on Sunday because his neighbors do, why should not they also rest on the Sabbath because he does? And as long as his Sunday work does not interfere with them what right have they to say that he shall not work on that day?—Clearly no right at all, except the right of brute force.
