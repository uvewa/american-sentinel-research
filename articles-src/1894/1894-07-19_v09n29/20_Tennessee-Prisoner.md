LET no reader of the SENTINEL forget for a moment that in the State of Tennessee a man is languishing in prison for no other crime than doing ordinary farm labor on Sunday, on his own place; or rather we should say, for no other crime than observing the Sabbath of the Lord, and disregarding the Sunday of the papacy.
