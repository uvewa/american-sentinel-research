The convent can be made so entrancingly lovely to the rich girl, during the period in which influences so easily become powerful, that in after years when fortune is in her hand, it is simple work to secure large gifts. Miss Caldwell gives a quarter of a million dollars to start the great Catholic University at Washington. But who is Miss Caldwell? She is a relative of Congressman Breckinridge of Kentucky, and belongs to an old Presbyterian family. When a child, on the death of one of her parents, influence was exerted to place her in a convent. That was all that was necessary. The convent did the rest. Miss Drexel bestows what is represented as a million and a half upon a Catholic institution. Who is Miss Drexel? She comes from a Methodist ancestry on one side, and a Baptist on the other. Protestant parents who send their girls to convent schools are placing them in the power of the best organized evil ever uncovered by history. It is a crime against their own offspring. How intelligent fathers can commit such a stupidity is little less than a marvel.—S. F. Hershey, in St. Louis Presbyterian.
