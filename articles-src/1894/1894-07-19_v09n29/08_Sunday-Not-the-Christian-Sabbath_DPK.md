AMERICAN SENTINEL: I was prompted to write this from reading the article of Thomas Hodge in the SENTINEL some weeks ago. He claims that the first day of the week, or Sunday, is the true Christian Sabbath because of the resurrection of Christ on that day.

I have always believed, until recently, that a person or community might observe any day they chose, so it was the seventh day after six consecutive days of labor. But as Sunday, being the universally observed day by all Christians, it was more convenient to keep that day than any other. But I am now led to believe otherwise, and from the very arguments advanced to sustain the Sunday theory.

I was reading, a few days ago, in "The Life of Christ," by Goikie, page 805, wherein the author says, "A whole week elapsed before the next appearance [of Christ] recorded. On Sunday, known henceforth as the 'first day of the week,' in contrast to the Jewish Sabbath, the seventh day, and as, especially, 'the Lord's day,'—the eleven, having once more assembled, as they had done daily through the week and continued to do, Jesus, honoring his resurrection day, once more stood in the midst of them. But Thomas, not having been present on the Sunday before, had doubted. But now, 'on this first Lord's day after the resurrection, however, his doubts were forever dispelled.'"

Now, thought I, this is conclusive evidence that Sunday is the true Christian Sabbath. But just then it occurred to me that it was a wrong construction, and that the facts disproved the theory, even though it was against my inclination to believe it, and that I had better investigate further before deciding. Hence I find in Gen. 2:1, 2: "Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made."

Now I infer from the foregoing that God was at perfect rest on that day. But it does not prove that his labors were ended, or that he did not resume them on the eighth day, or the first of another series of six days' labor.

Now I find a parallel in John 19:30, "When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost." Now as God rested on the seventh day after finishing the creation, and so established the Sabbath, so Christ rested on the same Sabbath, or seventh day, after finishing his labors for the purpose for which he came on the earth. And on the first day of the week he arose to commence his second life and resume his labors incident thereto.

Christ was crucified on the sixth day of the week. His life and necessary labors up to that time were finished and he rested on the seventh day or Sabbath. Was it by chance that he was crucified on the sixth day, or by design, that he might rest on the Sabbath, and so the day become doubly consecrated thereby? The people who were Jesus' companions before the crucifixion kept that Sabbath in the usual manner, Luke 23:25, 26. "And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. And they returned and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the Sabbath day, according to the commandment." But the next day, the first day of the week, they resumed their ordinary duties and labors. And that same day as Cleopas and another were going to Emmaus, Jesus walked with them and conversed with them, and they, then, knew him not, and he sat at meat and did break bread with them. And after that, the same day, he appeared to the eleven at Jerusalem. And after eight days he appeared unto them again at Jerusalem. And again he showed himself to the disciples at the Sea of Galilee.

Now there is no record of anything happening at any of these meetings to justify any one in changing the Sabbath, or to indicate that Jesus especially designed to honor his resurrection day more than any other. His other life and labors were closed, finished, at the crucifixion on the sixth day of the week and on the seventh, or Sabbath, he lay in the sepulchre at rest. But early in the morning on the first day of the week, he arose to take up a new life, as it were, on the earth for a while, and a work that he could not do in the other life, before the crucifixion; the work of impressing upon his disciples the very fact of the resurrection. He could not do that until after the crucifixion and the resurrection had taken place. And it took place very early on Sunday, first day of the week, and he immediately commenced the work necessary to accomplish his purpose.

Would it not be more appropriate for Christians to keep the seventh day, or Sabbath, as a holy day because of the fact that Christ kept it in the manner he did? Or if we must keep Sunday, would it not be more appropriate to keep it as a holiday with feasting and rejoicing, because of Christ having risen from the dead on that day to resume his life and work attending it?
