THE Christian Advocate of this city says of the second coming of Christ:—

There is not a vestige of evidence that goes to show that He will appear in a thousand years from now, Not even the angels in heaven know when He will come.

But these words are themselves an evidence that the event is near. Says the scripture: "There shall come in the last days scoffers, . . . saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation." 2 Peter 3:3, 4.

The Advocate confesses total ignorance of the coming of that day, but the Word of God says that sudden destruction shall come upon those who say, "Peace and safety," and adds, "But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief." 1 Thess. 5:3, 4. Those who know nothing about it will be destroyed because they don't want to know and willfully turn away from the truth. The Lord says of the signs of the second coming of Christ: "Now learn a parable of the fig tree: When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh. So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors. Verily I say unto you, this generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled. Matt. 24:32-34. And yet the Advocate says it may be a thousand years distant, and that we can know nothing about it!
