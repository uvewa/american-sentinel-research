In the formation of a union of Church and State, little by little the Church encroaches upon the domain of the State, until she finally obtains and usurps full control. The demands are mild at first. A law touching only one point is all that is asked, and this in a very mild form, and perhaps for ostensibly humanitarian reasons. But this one, though small in appearance, is big with results. By it the precedent for religious legislation, is established. This furnishes a foundation for all the like legislation that may follow. By and by another law is wanted, or the first one to be made a little more stringent.

This was indicated in the report of the hearing granted by the Premier of New South Wales, February 16, to the deputation from the Council of the Churches which waited upon him, to ask for the enforcement of the law prohibiting admissions being charged at Sunday concerts and amusements. The Rev. Dill Macky said, "By and by they would want the law a little more stringent." Yes; by and by, after a few concessions have been granted them, they will demand that the law shall be made more stringent. Seeing that they have gained control of the legislature, they will cease to petition and pray for what they desire; they will threaten and command.

This compulsory attitude which these religio-political organizations take on after they have become successful in their plans is well illustrated in a speech recently made by the field secretary of the American Sabbath Union. He said:

All denominations of any note are now united in this movement. Catholic and all, and we have succeeded in getting the cooperation of all labor unions, temperature associations, and other societies, political and ecclesiastical, to unite in one solid move on Congress to force them to pass a national Sunday law. We are prepared to make Congress understand that this is a Christian nation. We would be a set of fools to give up the battle now, after gaining the victory over Congress in the World's Fair movement. We must have a Sabbath day as we want it. The States have Sunday laws, but this is not enough. We are going to have a national law, and I think, I am sure, we shall have it before the first session of this Congress is closed. Measures are now effected to besiege Congress with representative men from every organized body in the land, and they will not dare refuse us. The Church should use the power of Congress to control the sins of the nation, and if she does not do so, blood will be upon her garments.—Review and Herald, Jan. 16, 1894.

This is plain enough. One victory was gained in the World's Fair movement, and now they propose to force Congress to pass such a law as they want. And under such a mighty combination they expect Congress to bend; "they will not dare refuse us," say they.

A union of Church and State is said to exist "where the Church usurps control over the State, as on the Romish theory, or where the State assumes to establish and control the Church, as in England." The union involved in such movements as are now on in the United States and Australia is evidently of the Romish kind.

The victory in the World's Fair matter was not a victory of Congress, but a victory "over Congress." The plan proposed is that "the Church should use the power of Congress" to control affairs and do her work. Plainly enough this is Church domination that is intended. It is the papacy over again; a veritable likeness, or image, of what that was in the days of its supremacy. And as men would shrink from seeing the days of proscription and persecution revived, and the Dark Ages lived over again, so should they shrink from giving countenance or support to this thing. Like causes cannot fail to produce like results. This law is still inexorable. Where are the wise men to foresee the evil and act with discretion? Who with pen and voice will sound the alarm?
