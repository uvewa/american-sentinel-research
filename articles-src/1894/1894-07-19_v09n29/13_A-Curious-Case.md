A LATE Belfast paper has this item of news under the heading, "A Curious Case":—

Justice Mather, in the Queen's Bench to-day, tried a case in which Mr. H. Reid, on behalf of the Lord's Day Observance Society, sought to recover penalties, under the Act of George the Third, from Mr. E. Wilson, solicitor to the liquidators of the Leeds Coliseum, and Mr. Ward, ex-mayor of Leeds, the former for allowing lectures at the colossum, and the latter for presiding at such lectures on the Sabbath day. The defending counsel contended that the lectures were intended to convey instruction in a pleasant and profitable way. The judge suggested to the observance society whether in attempting to protect the Lord's day, they were not aiding in filling rival institutions. The jury found for the plaintiff, but expressed the opinion that this law should be repealed. The judge concurred. Points of law remain over for further consideration.

It is only a few weeks since we printed the particulars of two cases in Australia under an old English statute. Is it not a little strange that such cases are coming up all over the world, and that men are being prosecuted under statutes that have for more than a century slumbered in innocuous desuetude?
