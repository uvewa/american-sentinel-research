Just now we are beset with a host of alarming manifestations, in our own population. Through a variety of causes a condition of our industrial forces has been superinduced, which threatens to convert a peaceful army of bread-winners, scattered through our cities and hamlets, into an army of maddened and persistent petitioners congregated at the nation's capitol, whose demand must be patiently considered, or blood will flow as the consequence. From nearly every point of the compass an industrial army with increasing force, is marching upon Washington, intent upon demanding that the Government shall do something to furnish employment to the now unemployed thousands of the land. Will these men content themselves with peacefully petitioning the Government authorities, or will they resort to violence? Herein is the alarming feature of the case.

Anarchists keep Europe in a continual state of alarm, especially the republic of France, and break out in deeds of violence occasionally here, to remind us of their presence.

Another source of anxiety to us now is the wide-spread strikes prevailing in our land. The Great Northern, and the miners' strike, as well as the threatened street car strike, not only throw vast numbers of men out of employment who, together with those dependent upon them, greatly need their earnings, but promise to breed greater mischief in the future, as the feeling of bitterness they engender becomes more intense.

In the midst of these alarms, nothing so becomes us as American citizens, as loyalty to the Government. It must be upheld at all hazards. There must be no compromise with open violence or rebellion. But the right of all to petition for redress of supposed grievances must be kept intact. We should know no difference between the poor laborer who comes any way he can come from west or east to petition the Government concerning his supposed wrongs, and the millionaire who comes in his sumptuous private car, to lobby with congressmen or the officers of the general Government respecting some scheme from which he hopes to realize a few million dollars. If one is received and listened to, the other should be and must be.

The critical character of the approaching crisis is now becoming apparent to all. The press that treated Coxey's Army as a huge joke, now takes on a tone of serious contemplation of an event which nearly all acknowledge may become a turning point in the nation's history. It is well that it should be soberly treated. It demands the most careful consideration and the most careful manipulation.—The Independent Patriot.
