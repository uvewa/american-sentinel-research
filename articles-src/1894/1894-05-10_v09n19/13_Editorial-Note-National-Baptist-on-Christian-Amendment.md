THE National Baptist, at the close of an article on the "Christian Amendment" to the Constitution, expresses itself in this language:—

We have seen Christianity make its way in spite of obstacles and menaces and persecutions; now we are afraid that it cannot continue to exist without a great deal of legal help. Christianity has asserted itself against the dominion of Nero, of Louis XIV., of the Inquisition. It will still conquer, and it will not allow itself to be indebted to the legal power for the triumphs which it will win.

Part of the last sentence of this is especially worthy of notice and of remembrance,—"It will not allow itself to be indebted to the legal power for the triumphs which it will win." This is truth. The fact that it is so, even if there were no other reason to offer, would make all attempts by the civil law to enforce, support, or promote religion, utterly futile, and therefore entirely uncalled for.
