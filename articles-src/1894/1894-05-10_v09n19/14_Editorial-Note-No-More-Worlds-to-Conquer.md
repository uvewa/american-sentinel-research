IN its issue of November 23, 1893, this was said in the SENTINEL:—

There are no more worlds to conquer. For generations the hives of Central Asia and Central Europe had swarmed and swept on to the westward. The Atlantic met them. They bridged it with ships. A new world was found. That too is occupied. They go to and fro but find no more worlds to conquer.

As these advancing human tides turned back upon themselves when they first came to the impassable sea, so now, as they meet the Pacific boundaries of emigration and encounter the reverse current from the Orient, they turn again. There is no new world beyond. Neither is there any possibility of stemming the flood, either from the east or the west. Here the conflict will be.

It is the showing of history that at comparatively regular periods, as the generations have reached their majority, vast and seemingly inexplicable movements of human hordes have been organized and have never rested in their aimless march, until dissipated by destruction or by being swallowed up in new and unoccupied lands or absorbed by alien peoples. The present march of the "Army of the Commonweal" may well be another of these great world movements, but if it be the beginnings of such it will prove of greater moment than the devastating incursion of the Huns across the then known world, or of the return march of the crusaders. Present social conditions do not so readily admit of a final advantageous outcome of such things, as then. The commonwealers will find no new worlds to conquer. It is beyond their power to renovate the old. What will be the result?
