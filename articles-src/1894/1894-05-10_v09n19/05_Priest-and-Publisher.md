S. D. Phelan is not only a priest, but the proprietor of the Western Watchman. As a priest he is a paragon of servility to the popish propaganda. As an editor he is an American man, an unawed advocate of freedom of the press. He will take his religion from Rome, but no ban from bishop or pope on his republican right of utterance. He recently promulgated the pernicious heresy that priests and ecclesiastics are subject to the States, to the civil statutes, the same as any one else. He maintained that the allegiance of American Catholics to our Government was paramount to their religious loyalty to the ghostly potentate at Rome. For this presumption Archbishop Kain ordered a condemnation of the Western Watchman. It was pronounced a paper unfit to circulate among Catholics. It was interdicted, like heretical publications in the Middle Ages. Its ecclesiastical condemnation was ordered to be read in every Catholic Church in the diocese. Rev. Phelan, still faithful as a priest, read the condemnation of his own paper to his own congregation. But the next day he entered his editorial empire and expressed himself thus:—

I own this paper. Now let me say to Archbishop Kain: No man owns me. He comes from an ex-slave State, and he knows what that means. No man owns me. I will go further and say, no man owns my pen.

Neither Archbishop Kain, nor all the bishops that assembled in Baltimore, have any authority to control the columns of the Watchman. As long as I am editor I shall control this paper, and while expressing honest opinions in a respectful way, I shall never apologize for them at the point of a threat or the threat of a censure. If the future is to be stormy for me, may it be bright for my fellow-priests, who will benefit by my suffering.

But for all this bravado the Rev. Mr. Phelan, in the columns of his paper April 15, publishes the following public apology and retraction:—

I, Rev. D. S. Phelan, editor of the Western Watchsons, also of the Sunday Watchman, hereby publicly disavow every utterance which I have published or permitted to be published in said papers derogatory to the person, or sacred office, of any bishop of the church, and I hereby recall any reflection upon the most reverend administrator of this diocese which has appeared in the columns of those papers, and I promise to prevent any such publications in the future under my control. I also retract the false position assumed in the article entitled "Address of the Editor," and fully acknowledge the right given to bishops over papers that claim to be exponents of Catholic thought.

It appears that the Church of Rome is again triumphant in her determination that free speech shall be suppressed, and that Catholic editors are owned by their superiors.—Ironclad Age.
