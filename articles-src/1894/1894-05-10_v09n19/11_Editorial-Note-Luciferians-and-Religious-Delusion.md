AMONG the suggestive signs of the hour is the appearance of a strange infatuation, of which the European dispatches make this mention:—

The recent sacrilegious thefts in Paris, including that at Notre Dame the other day, have been traced to the sect known as Luciferians, or worshipers of the devil. Their headquarters are near Fribourg, Switzerland, but a large branch live in Paris. They have a liturgy which is a parody of the mass. The consecrated elements are either stolen from churches or received in communion by female adherents. A service of profanation then takes place, which is known as black mass. Mgr. Fays, Bishop of Grenoble, has issued a circular to the clergy, ordering special vigilance, as the Luciferians abstract the hosts from village churches in lonely districts without stealing the ciberiums and nonustrances in which the sacrament is contained. At the Ministry of Public Worship the subject has been discussed, and instructions have been given to the Prefect of Police to increase his surveillance of the churches of Paris.

Religious delusion and fanaticism is increasing on every hand. The leaders of the so-called "Army of the Commonweal," in this country, are making pretensions to supernatural possession, and claiming to be reincarnations, under such circumstances that no man can forecast what may be the result, or what moment the utter unreason of devil-born religious mania may not seize them and their followers.
