About sixty years ago Alexander Campbell, editor of the Millennial Harbinger, a man of extraordinary acuteness of intellect, and who seemed to see into the far future almost with the eye of an inspired prophet, put upon record the following words:

Were I to be asked what is the darkest and most ominous cloud in our national heavens, unhesitatingly I would answer: "Slavery as now established by law."

Again, were I asked for the next most inauspicious and portentous cloud in our political horizon, I must, with equal promptitude, reply: "The rapid growth of a popish empire in the bosom of a republic."

Popey is naturally, essentially and necessarily despotic, cruel, and implacable. It constitutionally claims a sovereignty over, not only the secular sword, but over everything on earth; thought, language, action, spirit, soul, body, and estate. It regards itself as the heir of all earthly things, and by a right divine, and irrevocable, the only earthly king of kings and lord of lords. Its motto is: "The empire of the globe or nothing." The law of gravity will cease to act sooner than this superstition sleep on this side of absolute dominion.

It cannot be the guest in any land; it must be the host. It claims to be the church, the only church in which there is salvation; and that, as Jesus Christ is in heaven head over all things for the church, so his vicar of Rome is to be—jure divino—the head over all earthly things for the sake of the church, in which alone salvation can be found.

It cannot be cured; man cannot wash the Ethiopian white nor change the leopard's spotted skin.

While popey lives, it must reign. It is the soul, the soul, the very life of the system, and take away from it these attributes and nothing remains.

The words of those extracts are not the words of fanatics or enthusiasts or alarmists who cry "wolf, wolf" where there is no wolf; but of a highly enlightened judicial and thoughtful man, who, as a true watchman on the ramparts of Americanism and Protestantism, sounded the warning signal of the approach of the foe coming over the distant hills and plains. What a clear-sighted seer he was! How plainly this horoscopic sketch through that long stretch of years is defined to our eyes in our country's more recent history—of the coming foes, come, and laying close siege to the citadel of American liberty!—Christian Leader.
