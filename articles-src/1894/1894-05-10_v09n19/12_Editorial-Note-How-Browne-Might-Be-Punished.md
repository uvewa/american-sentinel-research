THIS item comes, most remarkably, from the Mail and Express, unless perhaps it may be that it is in earnest:—

HOW BROWNE MIGHT BE PUNISHED.

The Mail and Express Bureau,
Washington, D. C., May 2.

Chief Clerk McKinney, of the United States Supreme Court, this afternoon unearthed one of the old Blue Laws of Maryland, which is still in force in the District of Columbia, under which Carl Browne can be punished for his blasphemous pretensions of being the reincarnation of Christ.

The law provides that for the first offense the offender shall have his tongue bored through and pay a fine of £20, or suffer six months' imprisonment. For the second offense he shall be branded on the forehead with the letter B and pay £40 or suffer imprisonment for one year. For the third offense he shall suffer death without the benefit of the clergy.

In 1887 Mr. Phelps, then acting United States attorney general, gave an opinion that this law was still in force, and there has been no repealing enactment since.

In the last issue of the SENTINEL, extracts from this law were reprinted in the article entitled "Breckinridge—Morse Sunday Bill." It will be noticed there that a member of the House Committee on the District of Columbia declared that six years previous a man had been tried under that law in the District. There is the law then, and precedent is not wanting for the application of at least a portion of it.
