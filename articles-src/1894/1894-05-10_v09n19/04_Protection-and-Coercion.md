In the United States Senate a bill has been introduced entitled, "A bill to protect the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, as a day of rest and worship," etc.

"Protection" to-day is a much more taking expression than coercion of men, yet both mean the same thing. The only way in which a day can be "protected" as a day of rest and worship, is by prohibiting everybody from laboring, and by compelling all to attend worship on that day. For example, here is a field that is to be protected from trespassers. Now it is no protection to the field, if none are prohibited from crossing it save those whose inclination does not lead them that way, and if those who wish to cross it, or to play upon it, are allowed full liberty to do so. So a day cannot be "protected" from being used for labor or recreation, except by forcibly compelling some to pay regard to it against their will.

"Well, is there not of necessity the element of compulsion, or forcible restraint, in every law?" Certainly, and that is all right when the law is just; but we are not discussing the quality of law, but the propriety of a certain specific act of legislation. If it were within the province of civil government to legislate concerning Sunday or any other day, as a day of rest, then nothing could be said; but no law is a just law if by any reasonable application of it, it can possibly work injustice to anybody; and a law which declares men to be criminals for doing on one day that which is lawful in itself, and which the law allows on any other day, is unjust and inconsistent. It will be asked, "Do you then deny the right of government to appoint certain days as holidays?" By no means; but be it remembered that laws concerning holidays are merely permissive, and not mandatory. That is a law making a certain day a national holiday, gives people permission to rest, and find recreation, without danger of losing their situations, but does not compel any to cease from labor. On any holiday people who do not wish to rest are at liberty to work; but no Sunday law contemplates anything of that kind.

The wise man has said that "Whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever." Now in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, and rested on the seventh day, which day he blessed and sanctified. So we read, "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shall thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work." Just as surely as God commanded that the seventh day of the week should be kept holy, so surely he commanded that the other six days should be regarded as working days. Not that people are obliged to work every hour, but that the first six days are days in which people may work without sin. What God has permitted no man has a right to forbid.

"The Sabbath was made for man." Man was made first; the Sabbath was made for his aid and protection. The Psalmist, speaking to the righteous in the time of trouble, says, "His truth shall be thy shield and buckler." Ps. 91:4. The Sabbath is the protector; not the thing to be protected. The Sabbath needs no laws for its protection. When a day which men call the Sabbath, is "protected," and men are coerced, then the day is put above the man. The Sabbath was made for man, but Sunday laws regard man as made for the Sunday. Such laws show a total lack of comprehension of what the Sabbath is, not simply as to the day of the Sabbath, but as to the principle of Sabbath observance. No man can injure the Sabbath of the Lord, sacred as it is, by working on it. The injury is to himself—to his own soul. The Sabbath is just as sacred, just as valid, as though it had not been trampled upon by millions of people. It does not need protection. It is not like a glass vase, but is the very principle of life. If professed Sabbath-keepers should ask for, or be able to secure, laws against Sabbath-breaking, they would show that they knew nothing of the true, life-giving character of God's holy day; and when men ask for laws to "protect" Sunday as a rest day, they show that it has not in itself any of the characteristics of the true Sabbath of the Lord.

The bill in question makes an exception in favor of "works of necessity and mercy, and work by those who religiously observe Saturday, if performed in such a way as not to involve and disturb others." It is strange that men think such provisions in a Sunday law to be evidences of liberality and breadth of mind. On the contrary, they are the very things which emphasize the wickedness and inquisitorial nature of the law. How can that be? Look at the matter for a moment. In the first place, the law provides for an inquisition concerning one of the Christian graces,—one of the fruits of the Spirit, mercy which distils as the gentle rain from heaven. Here is a man who is arrested for doing work on Sunday. He claims that it was an act of mercy; his accuser contends that it was not. It is the motive of the heart, rather than the act itself, that determines whether or not it was a merciful act. And so the court, in order to a perfect execution of the law, must take the place of God, to judge the thoughts and intents of the heart. You say, "They can't do that." Of course not; and that shows the wickedness and folly of a law which makes the attempt necessary.

Again, another man is acquitted, although he has also worked on Sunday, because it is decided that his work was a work of mercy. Yet the man may have been actuated by the basest and most selfish motives. How many professally charitable deeds are performed by schemers, who are working only for gain to themselves. The apostle tells of some who suppose that gain is godliness; and it is very easy for a man to be deceived in that way. But a Sunday law usually provides that fallible men shall be judges of secret thoughts.

Those are exempted who "religiously observe Saturday." But who is to tell whether a man has observed the Sabbath religiously, or whether he has abstained from labor on that day because his surroundings are such that he can work to better advantage on Sunday? So we see that in order to carry out even the most "liberal" provision of the law, a man's religious character must be the subject of judicial investigation. Let it therefore be understood that any Sunday law, consistently carried out, involves the revival of the Inquisition. Why cannot Protestants who decry Church establishment see that civil laws enjoining religious duties are the perfection of Church and State union? —Present Truth, London, Eng.
