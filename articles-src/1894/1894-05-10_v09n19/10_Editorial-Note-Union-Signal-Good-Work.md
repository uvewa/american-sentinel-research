THE Union Signal, of April 26, says—

The saloon men of Minneapolis have joined the ranks of the most radical supporters of Sabbath observance. Because they are compelled to close their own places of business on Sunday, they declare that theaters and other places of amusement shall do likewise. They would even stop the street cars if that were possible. On the principle of "set a thief to catch a thief," it is possible they may have better success than the reformers they are trying to retaliate upon. Let the good work go on.

So this is the Union Signal's definition of a "good work"!
