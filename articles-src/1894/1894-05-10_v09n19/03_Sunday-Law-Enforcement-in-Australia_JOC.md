MATTERS in this country have not undergone any very great change during the last month. Times are just about as hard financially, and the prospects of the poor are a little dark, considering that winter will soon set in, when the chances for procuring work rather diminish. Much has been said and written of late concerning the way out of the present depression.

The Sunday law people, however, are as persistent in their cause as though nothing else was weighing on the public mind. Like the Jews of old, they are full of zeal which smacks much of fanaticism. They have their committees at work hunting up cases which may serve to keep their cause before the public until general sentiment will sustain their much-vaunted piety. Only a day or two ago one of their number was on his Sunday rounds looking after refractory individuals, and not happening to light upon any suitable case among Europeans, he went to the Chinese quarters, where he espied one Ah Quie doing something with a carpenter's plane. The next day the celestial was brought up and charged, under an act of Charles II., with "exercising the worldly work of his ordinary calling (cabinet-making) on part of the Lord's day commonly called Sunday."

It was established that the celestial was not a cabinet-maker, but a French polisher, and was, therefore, not working at his trade, but simply planing down the sides of a small mirror preparatory to shaving himself. It was, moreover, maintained by the defense that any man had a right to work on Sunday to make an article for his own use. But the keenest bit of argument made was that it is impossible to compel an alien unbeliever to observe the Lord's day, on the ground that its real observance required belief in it. The case was accordingly dismissed, and the prosecutors failed to win their much-coveted glory.

The activity in this line does not pass unnoticed by the secular press. The Age, in an editorial on this point, said:—

The man who wishes to spend Sunday in the fresh air is not necessarily such a criminal as the Sabbatarian would have us believe; nor will he be goaded into attending divine worship by being absolutely debarred from all rational relaxation and enjoyment on the first day of the week. If regularity at church entailed of necessity a high moral code, it would plainly be desirable to drive every citizen to the church door at the point of the bayonet—that is, supposing he declined to go, of his own accord; but, alas! the Jabes Spencer Balfour, the George Nicholson Taylors [noted criminals], and the rest of them are so often distinguished by all the outward manifestations of piety that one feels a doubt as to the efficacy of such a plan. Donald Nicholl, chairman of directors of the City of Glasgow bank, absolutely refused, on principle, to read Monday's paper, because its publication had entailed a certain amount of Sunday labor; yet he was proved to have knowingly connived at a system of swindling which reduced thousands from affluence to beggary, and caused a shock through Scotland that those who were there at the time will not readily forget. And of course the list might be easily prolonged.

From the above it is seen that the discussion of the Sunday question here is bringing out some of the fine points connected with it, and much to the detriment of those who are so piously jealous of the way the unbelieving world spend Sunday. This topic promises soon to be a very interesting one, and we hope its discussion will result in opening the eyes of many to the truth of the matter. Indeed it is already doing that. Not long since a deputation of ministers waited on the premier of New South Wales, asking for more stringent Sunday laws. He asked if they based their requests on the demand of the fourth commandment. They said that was the very basis of their action. "Well, then," said he, "Sunday is ruled out of the case; for that commandment enjoins the keeping of the seventh day, and that is Saturday." The deputation were obliged to retire rather crestfallen. But these people care little for rebuffs. They will soon stir up the thing again, when we expect to see considerable public agitation about it. Let it come, the sooner the better; for then the conflict will the sooner be over, and the work done which is to bring our blessed Lord.—J. O. Corliss, in Review and Herald.
