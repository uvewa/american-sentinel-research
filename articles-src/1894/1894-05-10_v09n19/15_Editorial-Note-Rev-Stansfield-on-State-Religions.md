THE Rev. Joshua Stansfield, of Port Huron, Mich., has discussed in his pulpit the question of "State Religions and the Public Schools." The Daily Times, of Port Huron, publishes his address. He summarizes his charges against Roman Catholicism thus:—

And now to sum up. We charge in a word against this foreign system:—

1. That the supreme sovereignty of the pope is obstinately opposed to the sovereignty of the people.

2. That as a supreme pontiff in both spiritual and temporal things, the pope demands the allegiance of every Roman Catholic to him, instead of to the laws and Constitution of the land.

3. We see that all Romanists who seek citizenship in this country do not cease allegiance to that foreign potentate at Rome, although they swear to do so in order to receive the rights and benefits of American citizenship.

4. Romanism teaches and practices religious intolerance instead of religious liberty, which the Constitution of our country so clearly calls for.

5. The Romish Church is stoutly opposed to the freedom of speech and of the press, claiming a divine right of censorship of all ideas in both speech and letters.

6. We find from her own utterances that the papal church is unanimously in favor of the union of Church and State, whereas our Constitution demands entire separation.

7. The Romish Church is determinedly opposed to our public school system, and her avowed purpose is to break it down.

Rev. Mr. Stansfield is a Methodist, and of late years the Methodists have been particularly prominent in this country in the enforcement and attempted enforcement of religious laws, by which they have taught and practised "religious intolerance instead of religious liberty, which the Constitution of our country so clearly calls for." Again, the Methodist Church expressed itself unanimously in favor of the action of Congress to close the World's Fair on Sunday, and Justice Brewer's decision that "this is a Christian nation,"—which things virtually created a union of Church and State in this country; therefore, the Methodist Church is "unanimously in favor of a union of Church and State, whereas our Constitution demands entire separation." There is evidently room for Rev. Joshua Stansfield to turn his guns upon the Methodist Church as well as the Roman Catholic. Will he do so? If he should not, what will it prove?
