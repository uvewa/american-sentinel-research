TWO more arrests of Adventists, for Sunday work, are reported from Tennessee. This time Rhea County, in the eastern part of the State, is the scene of the persecution. These arrests seem to have been made under the statute, and the cases tried before a justice of the peace. One prisoner was found not guilty, the other was fined $3 and costs, amounting in all to $10. He refused to make payment and is in jail. The Circuit Court is in session and indictments under the nuisance decision are looked for. The Adventists are sowing the county with religious liberty literature.
