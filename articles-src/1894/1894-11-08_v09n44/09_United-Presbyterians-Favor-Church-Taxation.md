PITTSBURG, Oct. 29.—Should church property be exempt from taxation was vigorously discussed and answered in the negative here to-day by the United Presbyterian Ministers' Association. The Rev. John A. Wilson, D.D., of the United Presbyterian Theological Seminary presented an able paper upon the subject. Incidental to the subject there was considerable discussion of the proneness of some ministers to ask reductions in the bills of their grocers, bakers, butchers, tailors, and others with whom they deal, out of respect to the cloth. This practice was bitterly denounced by all who spoke on the subject.—New York Sun, Oct. 30.
