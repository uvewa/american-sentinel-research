IT is probable that ere this paper reaches our readers Elder H. P. Holser will be serving out his sentence in a Swiss jail for refusing to close the Basel Seventh-day Adventist publishing house on Sunday. Read his manly, straightforward defense on page 349, and then candidly answer the questions, Are Sunday statutes just laws? Is Sunday observance a proper subject of civil law?
