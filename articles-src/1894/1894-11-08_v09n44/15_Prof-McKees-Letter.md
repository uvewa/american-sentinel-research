WE print on page 349 a portion of a lengthy communication from Prof. W. H. McKee, formerly on the editorial staff of this paper, giving entire Elder H. P. Holser's plea before the Swiss courts. This plea is quite long and we had already published a synopsis of it, but owing to its value, and considering the fact that many of our readers would doubtless wish to have it all, we print it just as Prof. McKee sends it. The conclusion together with our correspondent's comments on the situation in Switzerland, will appear next week.
