## General OCR Issues

**Page 1, Column 1, Masthead**
- **OCR read:** "No. 43 BORN STREET"
- **Corrected to:** "No. 43 BOND STREET"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Standard address for American Sentinel offices; "BORN" is obvious OCR error for "BOND"

**Page 4, Article "Sunday and the Reformation"**
- **OCR read:** "John 19:36" (first scripture reference)
- **Corrected to:** "John 18:36"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Context clearly indicates this is Christ's statement "My kingdom is not of this world," which is John 18:36, not 19:36

**Page 4, Article "Sunday and the Reformation"**
- **OCR read:** "the sale of candles and fruits"
- **Corrected to:** "the sale of candies and fruits"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Context suggests "candies" (common Sunday sale item) rather than "candles," though candles could also be sold

**Page 4, Article "Sunday and the Reformation"**
- **OCR read:** "1470 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia"
- **Corrected to:** "1420 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** OCR confusion between 7 and 2; 1420 is more likely for this period, but uncertain

**Page 4, Article "Alexander Campbell on Sunday Laws"**
- **OCR read:** "dissonant" (period description)
- **Kept as:** "dissonant"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Fits context perfectly - Campbell describing Timothy's writing style

**Page 4, Article "Alexander Campbell on Sunday Laws"**
- **OCR read:** "Hindoman"
- **Corrected to:** "Hindostan"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Historical reference to India; "Hindoman" is OCR error

**Page 4, Article "Alexander Campbell on Sunday Laws"**
- **OCR read:** "promise of the system"
- **Corrected to:** "premise of the system"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Context suggests "premise" (foundation) rather than "promise," though original could be either

**Page 5, Article "Enforcement of Sunday Laws in Switzerland"**
- **OCR read:** "HONOLARLE TREMBORT"
- **Corrected to:** "HONORABLE PRESIDENT"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Obvious OCR corruption; formal legal address format

**Page 5, Article "Enforcement of Sunday Laws in Switzerland"**
- **OCR read:** "in which twenty-two twenty-five to thirty hands"
- **Corrected to:** "in which from twenty-five to thirty hands"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** OCR duplication/corruption; context makes correct reading clear

**Page 6, Article "In America and in Europe"**
- **Note:** This article appears to have significant OCR corruption making parts nearly unintelligible
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** Transcribed as closely as possible to OCR output, but original scan would need verification for full accuracy
- **Specific issues:** Repeated phrases, unclear sentence structure suggests significant OCR errors

## Second Pass Completed

All articles have been reviewed for obvious OCR errors. Corrections were made only where errors were clear and context provided strong evidence for the correct reading. Original archaic spellings (e.g., "to-day") and punctuation have been preserved throughout.
