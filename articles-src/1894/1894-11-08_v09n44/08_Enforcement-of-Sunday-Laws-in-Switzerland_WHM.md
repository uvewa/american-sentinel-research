BY W. H. MCKEE, BASEL, SWITZERLAND.

The appealed case of Elder H. P. Holser, manager of the publishing house of the Seventh-day Adventists, at Basel, Switzerland, has been heard by the Federal Tribunal,—the supreme court of the federated cantons,—at Lausanne, and the decision of the lower courts affirmed. The costs of the appeal, however, were ordered paid by the State.

This case was brought under Article 14 of the factory law, which reads thus:—

Labor on Sunday is prohibited, cases of necessity accepted, and with the exception of such establishments as by their nature require an uninterrupted continuance and have for this obtained the permission of the Federal Council (Bundesrath), in accordance with the previous Article 13. In an institution of this kind also the second Sunday must remain free for each workman.

The cantonal legislature is at liberty to appoint further holidays on which factory work may be prohibited as on Sunday. These holidays may, however, not exceed the number of eight during the year.

Such festival days can be declared binding by the cantonal legislature only for those professing that creed.

Those who will not labor on other church festival days shall not be fined because of refusal to work.

This law applies to every establishment employing five or more workmen; every such institution being adjudged to be a factory under the terms of the law. It has always been the custom, in every institution belonging to the Seventh-day Adventists, in all parts of the world, to perform ordinary labor on Sunday. Mr. Holser, as manager, and therefore responsible, was arrested for the work done on Sunday in the Basel publishing house, convicted, and condemned to both fine and imprisonment. The case was carried from the city police court of Basel to the court of appeals, where it was decided against Mr. Holser, and he addressed the following appeal to the Federal Council,—the court of last resort:—

To the Swiss Bundesgericht at Lausanne,

HONORABLE PRESIDENT AND JUDGES:—

Gentlemen: The undersigned is a member of the Seventh-day Adventist denomination, which has thirteen churches in French and German Switzerland, and a large publishing house in Basel, in which from twenty-five to thirty hands are employed. Our first object is to serve God, in whose name the Federal Constitution is proclaimed. We recognize God's law of ten commandments as supreme, the fourth of which enjoins rest on the seventh day. This unchanged law we observe, just as it is written in the Bible, and accordingly rest on Saturday and work the other six days, including Sunday.

Our highest object being the observance of the ten commandments, our people have gained a good reputation for being quiet, orderly and industrious. (The truthfulness of this statement may be attested by reference to the citizens of Basel, where we have a church of a hundred members.) During the first years of its existence, our publishing house was not interfered with by the police authorities; but during the last two years we have been fined eight times for Sunday work. These fines, amounting to 320 francs, we could not conscientiously pay, because they were imposed in consequence of our keeping the ten commandments, and therefore were unjust. Hence the authorities seized our private household goods, and sold them at public auction.

August 16, I was again sentenced to three weeks in prison, and 200 francs fines, or forty days in prison, for having worked Sunday August 13, and in addition was threatened with the closing of our business entirely. An appeal to the Court of Appeals, Basel-Stadt, resulted in a confirmation of the decision of the police court; hence I appeal to the Federal Council, and base my appeal on the following:

1. As a Protestant, I acknowledge the Word of God as my only rule of faith and practice. To me, the Bible is the revealed will of God. Chief among the expressions of the divine will are the ten commandments, the fourth of which says, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor. . . . but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. In it thou shalt not do any work." This command enjoins labor on the six days as well as rest on the seventh. It is God's express command to me, and my hope for eternal life depends on explicit obedience to this as well as all other commands of Jehovah. Human laws are enforced to the letter, not even a word being allowed to be changed. How much less ought we to change the law of the Supreme? Believing thus, it is impossible for me to obey the law forbidding me to work on Sunday, a day on which God commands me to work. My inability to obey this Sunday law does not arise from a fanatical fancy of my own, or of some sectarian leader, but from allegiance to the ten commandments which Christians have in all ages acknowledged.

2. According to God's word, Sunday is for us a rival institution to God's Sabbath. It stands as the sign of authority of a church which we as true Protestants cannot accept. It has been argued that the Sunday law does not oblige us to accept the day as a religious institution, but simply to lay aside our secular work on that day. But as Sunday observance in Switzerland consists simply in not working, when we cease to carry on our regular work, we keep the day to all intents and purposes. The only way to show that we do not keep the day is for us to work on it. Therefore, by forcing us to lay aside our secular work on this day, Sunday laws oblige us to accept an institution directly opposed to our faith.

3. The object of Article 14 of the factory law, under which I am condemned, is to protect the laboring class against the avarice of the capitalist, by securing him a day of rest each week. Our house does not allow work, under any circumstances, on the seventh day, so each employe is absolutely sure of a weekly rest-day, and thus we certainly meet the object of the law. With scarce an exception, our employes observe the seventh day as a matter of conscience. When compelled to lay down their work on the first day also, they suffer under this law which, according to its chief promoters, is philanthropic, not oppressive. Hence, by enforcing Sunday observance on our house, the object of Article 14 of the factory law is defeated. The Federal Factory inspector acknowledged this in 1886, and ordered that in consequence we be not molested on account of Sunday work.

4. The enforcement of Sunday laws on Seventh-day Adventists is a violation of Article 49 of the Federal Constitution, which says: "Religious liberty and freedom of conscience are inviolable.

"No one may be compelled to take part in a religious organization, or in religious instruction, or to undertake a religious act, or suffer the infliction of punishment of any sort whatsoever on account of religious views.

"The exercise of civil rights may be restricted by no sort of precepts or conditions of an ecclesiastical nature.

"Religious views do not release from the fulfillment of civil duties."

It is our natural and inalienable right to serve God according to the dictates of our own consciences. The State cannot give us this right; we have it direct from God, by virtue of being human beings; and the State can only protect us in the exercise of this right. Should we attempt to exercise it in a way to invade our neighbor's rights, then the State must interfere, not because we are exercising our right, but to protect the rights of our neighbor. But while we keep the ten commandments, it cannot be made to appear that we invade the rights of our neighbor. Further, under Article 49, we read: "Religious views do not release from the fulfillment of civil duties." But it being our natural right to work, and only a religious but never a civil duty to rest from labor one day every week, it cannot be claimed that it is a duty which we owe to the State to rest on Sunday. Again, under the same article we read: "No one may be subjected to fines [or punishment] of any kind whatsoever because of the religious views." The sole and only reason why I am fined under the Sunday law is because of my religious belief that I must keep Saturday.

5. I appeal from the decision of the police court, not from a motive to resist the civil government, but because I must obey God rather than man. The civil government being ordained of God, is under and not above him. Now, if the State makes laws hindering me from keeping the commandments of God, who is above the State, it thereby elevates itself above God, and we cannot obey it in this presumption.

Paul, who was inspired to write, that we should be subject to the powers that be, lived under a heathen government, which commanded men to honor the gods of Rome and forbade as treason the introduction of another god; but he did introduce another God, who overthrew all the gods of Rome. This proves that the command to be subject to the powers that be cannot have reference to religion.

In Romans 13:2-4, we read: "Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God; and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good and thou shalt have praise of the same. For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain; for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil." Thus it is plain that God's order in ordaining the State is for the punishment of evil-doers and the praise of them that do well; and when the State pronounces this evil and punishes me for it, the State is acting against God's order.

6. The province of the State is to protect the individual in the exercise of his natural rights; and not to protect majorities only, and even aid the majority in depriving the minority of some of their natural rights. One of the natural rights of man is to perform honest labor. When the State obliges me to rest or cease labor on Sunday, it deprives me of this right. If the majority has the right to deprive me of one natural right, it may deprive me of all, and thus reduce me to the condition of slavery.

After observing the seventh day in obedience to our consciences instructed by the Bible, we have the same right to work six days as those who keep the first day. If first-day observers have a right to use the State to force us to keep the first day after we have rested the seventh, we have the same right to use the State to force them to rest the seventh day in addition to the first. We acknowledge the right of the State to protect us in our right to rest; but we protest against the State forcing us to lay aside our regular work on a day on which our conscience tells us to labor.

7. In forcing Sunday observance on me and Seventh-day Adventists whom I represent, the State deprives us of one-sixth of our income. It is declared that the Sunday law does not hinder our keeping the Sabbath; but it does rob us of one-sixth of our living. What right has the majority to impose a tax of 16½ per cent. on the minority for the privilege of exercising freedom of conscience? The Constitution grants freedom of conscience to every citizen; hence a law which imposes a tax of 16½ per cent. on the minority for this privilege is openly against the Constitution. As Christians, it is our duty to provide for our families.

"But if any provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel." 1 Tim. 5:8. Under the present conditions it is impossible to maintain a family with but five days work per week; hence by prohibiting our working on Sunday, the State brings us into a condition which the Bible calls heathen; and so these Sunday laws would force us to deny the faith.

The State's attorney argued that the Sunday law prohibited our work in the factory only, and that we would work at home. But here we would be restricted by other Sunday laws; and very few factory hands have work at home that would be remunerative. Because we keep the Sabbath, it is almost impossible to find work among Sunday-keepers; so we must have factories of our own; and if we are not allowed to work on Sunday, we are certainly oppressed by the State because of our religion.

8. It is also argued that Sunday laws are civil, not religious, and so cannot interfere with religious liberty. But they do interfere with our religious liberty. Wherever such laws are enforced, there is liberty of conscience only for those that accept Sunday and those that are indifferent about the day. But it is our duty to work six days, and Sunday being one of these six work days I must work on it in order to keep the commandment.

Again, Sunday laws are a violation of Article 49 of the Constitution, which says: "The exercise of civil or political rights cannot be restricted by any kind of regulations or conditions of a religious or ecclesiastical nature." Sunday is a church institution. It was established by the church, and has ever been promoted by the church. It is to be found only where professing Christians are found. The week is not a natural division of time, but is purely a Bible institution, given by inspiration, and Sunday is to occupy the place of the Sabbath in the week. Only those nations that have the Bible have the week. When the French Revolution rejected the Bible, it rejected the week, and also Sunday as a part of it. Another evidence that Sunday is religious is that its chief promoters are the ministers. This is true in all parts of the world. Societies formed for the promotion of Sunday observance are organized by ministers and religious people; and with few exceptions, the officers of such societies are ministers. . . .

Furthermore, Sunday law advocates do not want a secular Sunday. That is the very thing they don't want. The chief agitators for Sunday laws want a religious day. The religious part is the essential part. The proceedings of the international congresses for Sunday Rest show this with sufficient plainness.

(Conclusion next week.)
