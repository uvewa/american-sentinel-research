The Catholic Review does not as a rule take part in politics. On the contrary it carefully avoids it. The exception happens when faith, morals, or Catholic rights are in peril or jeopardy. In that case, it speaks out without fear or favor, without parties to the faith, in the right of the church. The Christian Review does not support the faith in the right of the church. The phrase "I speak of the faith" is not identical to the phrase "I speak of the faith." In reference to a clause which has been in force in Cisleithania for the past twenty-six years, permitting people when describing themselves to declare that they belong to no recognized faith, or that they are confessionless which is not identical with professing no religion; Cardinal Bishop Schönborn, however, declared the clause to be religious anarchism, and said that it could only promote infidelity, atheism, and irreligion, and prepare the way for political anarchism, just as the bill of the Church is not.

This is a reference to the laws permitting, among other things, Christians to be converted to Judaism would contribute to undermine the moral basis of the Hungarian people.—From London Tablet, Roman Catholic, reprinted in Catholic Review of October 22, 1894.
