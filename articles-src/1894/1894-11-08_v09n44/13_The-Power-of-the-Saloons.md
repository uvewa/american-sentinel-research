THE churches are bodily against Tammany, and this is a formidable power, but with 9,000 saloons as a reserve at their back the Tammany leaders think they can set the churches, of which there are less than 1,000 in this city, at defiance. Tammany does not like to believe that the liquor dealers are in open revolt against the blackmailers.

"Each one of these saloons," said a Tammany leader the other day, "absolutely controls not less than six votes. There are 54,000 votes in all we are sure of. The regular organization has in addition not less than 90,000 votes, and with these as a fighting force and the saloons as a reserve, the preachers may howl and the papers may denounce, but we can afford to laugh."

The claim of 90,000 members for the regular Tammany organization is, without doubt, a fiction, but the strength of the saloons has not been exaggerated by this man. The saloons may be said to hold the balance of power when the party lines are closely drawn. In the destruction of Tammany it will be an error to count the victory as won till the power of the saloons is weakened, or better still—destroyed.—Commercial Advertiser, Oct. 29.
