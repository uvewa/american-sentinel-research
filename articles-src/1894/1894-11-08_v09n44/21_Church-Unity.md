THE Independent says, whether ironically or not, we do not say:—

Here is another sign in the heavens of the approaching ecclesiastical millennium. At the meeting of the Northwestern Association (Congregational) of Pennsylvania, held in Allegheny, Penn., October 16-18th, the subject of church unity was given a prominent place. The offer for Christian unity made by the Congregational churches of the New Jersey Association and indorsed by other States, was presented by the Rev. H. M. Bowden, and a discussion of the question followed, participated in by representatives of the German Evangelical Synod of North America, the Methodist Protestant and the Baptist churches. There was present through most of the meetings an accredited delegate from the Free Baptist Conference. It is believed that the way is clear for a combined meeting of delegates from these and a number of other churches, and that the near future will see alliances formed of at least local significance.

If these alliances were formed upon truth, they would be hailed with joy by every Christian, but being formed as they are for the support, for the most part, of the unscriptural Sunday dogma, they are significant, but only ominously so.
