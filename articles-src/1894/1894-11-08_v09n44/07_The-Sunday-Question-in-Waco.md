Waco is a beautiful city of perhaps twenty thousand inhabitants, admirably located on the Brazos River, near the centre of the State and surrounded by rich agricultural lands, from which immense crops of cotton, corn, wheat, and oats are gathered every year, but it is greatly handicapped by mossbackism, and religion of the sour-godliness type. It has more fine churches and high salaried preachers than any other city of its size in the State, though, morally it is no better than the worst of them.

Lately some enterprising citizens have arranged for a cotton palace exposition, which is to be open during the month of November, and from what we can learn it will be a credit to the city, but no one will be allowed to see it on Sunday.

The board of directors passed a resolution to open it on Sunday, but the preachers who have always had a monopoly of that day for transacting their business set up such a howl that the board, like good little Sunday-school boys, made hot haste to rescind their action and now it is to be kept closed so tight on the "Lord's day" that a mouse could not get in.

It is said there are about twenty churches in the city with seating capacity for possibly six thousand people, which leaves fourteen thousand which could not get into them if all should take a notion to go to church at once. Now we think the majority who could not be accommodated in the churches should have the privilege of attending the cotton palace if they want to, but this dog-in-the-manger spirit of the preachers will not permit them to do so.

To open the cotton palace on Sunday need not close the churches provided anybody wants to go to church. To extend to the public the privilege of attending the cotton palace on Sunday would not hinder anybody from going to church who wants to go, and if there are people here who would prefer the cotton palace to the church, we think in all fairness they should be allowed to go there, since every one who wants to go to church is perfectly free to do so.

There is no reasonable excuse for such narrow-minded bigotry, and that, too, in deference to a minority of our citizens, for we feel perfectly certain that if this Sunday question could be left to a vote of the people, the cotton palace would be opened on Sundays just as it will be on other days.

We would not be in favor of denying the churches any privilege that rightfully belongs to them, nor do we want to see them interfered with in their right to spend the Sunday just as they please, but they have no right to prevent other people from doing the same. A majority of our people are not likely to attend the churches during the time the cotton palace will be open, and if they should, there is nothing to prevent their doing so except that the churches are not large enough to hold them.

It is plain enough to any observing person that all this fuss about desecrating the Sabbath is business with the preachers. They know well and good that if the cotton palace is kept open on Sundays it will knock down church attendance, and that will be money out of their pockets. They are not willing to put their preaching in competition with the cotton palace, for if they should we doubt if half their own members would go to church a single Sunday during the exposition period.

There are many people here who cannot attend the cotton palace on a week day without losing a day's work in addition to the gate fees, and many will be here over Sunday, on expenses that will be a dead loss to them.

We are not astonished at the turn this thing has taken, for Waco is a priest-ridden city. It has its full share of saloons and other sinks of corruption that are patronized day and night with frequent robberies and murders, but the line is drawn at desecrating the "holy Sabbath."

We hope to see many readers of the Pulpit here during the opening of the cotton palace, but they are advised to come early in the week so as to return home before Sunday. — Independent Pulpit, Waco, Texas.
