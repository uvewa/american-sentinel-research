LAST spring two Seventh-day Adventists were arrested at Shady Side, Md., for Sunday work, on a warrant issued by a justice of the peace. They waived a hearing and were bound over by the justice to the circuit court. On Monday, October 22, they appeared before the court at Annapolis and were told by the State's attorney that their cases would not be called before the following Monday, and that they could go until that time. Two days later, one of them, H. O. Bullen, was arrested on a bench warrant and placed in jail. The other, A. J. Howard, hearing that a warrant was out for him also, went immediately to court. Both gave new bonds for their appearance on October 29. The prosecuting attorney said he had forgotten that he had excused them.

A. J. Howard, one of the accused men, is a minister, and a lawyer who had heard him preach on one occasion, came to him and offered to defend him and his friend, Mr. Bullen, free of charge. His kind offer was accepted, and when the cases were called, October 29, the lawyer filed a demurrer to the indictment. The ground of the demurrer was that the indictment only charged bodily labor on Sunday and did not specify that it was not work of "charity or necessity." The court sustained the demurrer, and also voluntarily held that Sunday work is not indictable in Maryland, and that cases of that character could come before the circuit court only on appeal from a justice of the peace. The accused Adventists were, of course, both discharged, the county paying the costs.
