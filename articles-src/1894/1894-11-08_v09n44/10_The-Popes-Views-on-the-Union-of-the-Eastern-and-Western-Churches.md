ROME, Oct. 29.—The text of the pope's speech to the conference held to consider the union of the Eastern and Western churches has just been made public, although the speech was delivered on the 24th. After praising all who had helped bring about the conference, he said:—

"We wish that all governments alike had embraced this grand ideal, inasmuch as the work, if achieved, will be for the interest and benefit of the entire world; but political views and, still more, we regret to say, the unreasonable jealousies of some of the governments, which show in what condition the papacy is placed, have prevented these reunions from having the large and solid results rightly expected from them.

"Above all, we must lament the absence of the patriarch of the Armenians. We shall not on this account, however, recede from our purpose, and, even if we can count only within certain limits on political union, nothing will prevent us from solving the grand problem from the religious side while awaiting more propitious times for the rest of the work."—New York Sun, Oct. 30.
