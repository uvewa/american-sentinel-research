NOTHING is nearer my heart than Christian unity. Not only is the present pope earnestly looking forward to the time when Christian unity may come, but we see in the utterances of cardinals, archbishops, and bishops that the unity of Christendom is weighing on their hearts. There is nothing in the New Testament that prevents all of us from coming together. For some years I have agreed with the authorities of the Catholic Church to a certain extent in the interpretation that they place upon the words, "Upon this rock will I build my church." Peter was the first Christian to be put in place after Christ. Others follow after. Many of the terms in the Testament are really synonymous. They all teach Christian unity.—Dr. Briggs, quoted in Presbyterian Observer, in an address on Christian Unity.
