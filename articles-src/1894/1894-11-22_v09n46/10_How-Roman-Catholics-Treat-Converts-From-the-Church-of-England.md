The following letter from the Rev. A. Lambert, formerly a priest of the Roman Catholic Church, and now engaged in what is called the Pauline Mission, of this city, is of important interest, not merely as a confirmation of Cardinal Vaughan's statement, that no true Catholic recognizes the validity of the orders of the Church of England, but because of the names quoted:—

60 W. 106 St., New York City Oct. 4, 1894.

Editor Christian Advocate. I have read your article, "The Measure They Mete Measured Unto Them," in The Christian Advocate of to-day. I am at a loss to understand how Episcopalian ministers can be so little posted in modern Church history as to believe that Rome recognizes the validity of Anglican orders. To quote but a few names—Newman, Manning, Oakeley, Faber, Gamble, Burns, Marshall; Bowden, St. John, Hutton, Oratorians; Spencer, a Passionist; Anderdon, a Jesuit; Lockhart, a Romanian Father Coffin, Bridget, Hall, Urquhart, Redemptorists; Baker a Paulist; Preston, the vicar general of Cardinal McCloskey—who were once Episcopalian ministers, were not only reordained, but nearly all, if not all, re-baptized, when they joined the church of Rome. They received "first tonsure," and went through the whole line of Romanist orders—porter, exorcist, lector, acolythe, subdeacon, deacon—before being ordained priests of the church of Rome.

Yours fraternally in the Master,

A. LAMBERT.

This process of Romanizing goes on constantly in the city of New York.—Christian Advocate.
