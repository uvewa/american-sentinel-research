[In 1820 there was organized in West Middletown, Washington Co., Pa., a society, called the West Middletown Moral Society. The principal object of the society was to enforce the Pennsylvania Sunday law of 1794, which is still on the statute books of the State. This Moral Society was organized by the United Presbyterian, the same people who, later in 1863, organized the National Reform Association. Alexander Campbell, the founder of the Christian or Disciple Church, ably opposed the society in a series of articles published in the Reporter, of Washington, county seat of Washington County. His articles were signed "Candidus." A United Presbyterian minister, by the name of Wylie, attempted to defend the society, and signed himself "Timothy." The discussion continued from April 17, 1820, the date of Mr. Campbell's first article, to February 22, 1822, during which time almost every phase of the compulsory Sunday law question was treated. As a result the Moral Society perished, not to appear again until 1863 when it was revived by the same denomination under the name National Reform Association. Every word of Mr. Campbell's invincible logic and withering denunciation is applicable to the association, reenactiated under the name, National Reform Association, and kindred organizations, such as the American Sabbath Union, the Pennsylvania Sabbath Association, etc.]

MR. TIMOTHY tells us in his first number that his "object is the preservation of the public morals." From this sentence and others of similar import, it is insinuated that my efforts are leveled against the public morals. Now I would think that a man of Mr. T.'s sense of honor whould not deal so much in dark innuendous. Let him plainly assert that I am an enemy to public morals, that I delight in immorality and wickedness, as my native element, and that I aim at the extirpation of all moral order, and not like the crafty Ulysses attempt,—"Spargere vocce in vulgum ambigaus."

But is it so, that T. and all those who have opposed me, have really, and in fact, identified the existing custom of fining men for Sabbath-breaking, with morality, so that he who opposeth this practice is thereby to be branded immoral and profane? Do they think so? Then they must think, that all those who do not fine men for all such vices as drunkenness, profanity, and Sabbath-breaking, are immoral and profane; and those who speak or write against fines and imprisonments, as means of moralizing, are accounted as apostles of immorality and to be treated as demoralizers of society.

Such views suit the latitude of Madrid or Goa; they are not suitable to the climate of Pennsylvania. But perhaps they do not think so; they merely intend to hold up to odium him whom they are conscious they cannot refute. Upon this hypothesis, perverse are their hearts, and immoral their efforts. Let us hope better things of Mr. T. and suppose that it is with him, the cant of his colleagues; rather let us impute it to a defect in his understanding, than to any perversity of heart. And is it not a defect, a great defect in the understanding of any man, to hold anything human, so sacred, as to suppose it immoral or profane to call it in question? Is it not a defect in the understanding of any man to think that before the law of '94 and the existence of moral societies there was little or no morality in the State of Pennsylvania? Is it not a defect in the understanding of any man to suppose that either moral societies, or inquisitions have ameliorated society, or reduced the quantum of actual wickedness? From such views, and from such only, can all those dark innuendous proceed. I choose rather to attribute them to the head than to the heart of so good a man as Timothy. It is, then, the opinion of Timothy and his colleagues, that he that opposeth the moral association of West Middletown, or the law of 1794, is in that very act immoral and profane.

But seeing I consider moral societies a moral evil, and the laws under which they act, as immoral in their tendency (however well intended), the query is: whether I may not with as much propriety, and with as high a claim on the faith of the community, as T., say that "my object is the preservation of the public morals." Have I not said and demonstrated that he who pockets the four dollars taken from the Sabbath-breaker, is as great a sinner as he who violates the Sabbath? It would then seem that I am moved to oppose the "moral association" from a conviction that they are immoral in their tendency. —Candidus (Alexander Campbell), in Washington (Pa.) Reporter, April 23, 1821.
