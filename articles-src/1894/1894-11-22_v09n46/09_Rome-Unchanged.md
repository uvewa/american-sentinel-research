HAS Rome changed? Has she become the friend and advocate of religious freedom? In two of the leading countries of Europe she has lately answered this question. In Hungary, after opposing with all her strength the Civil Marriage bill, which narrowly escaped extinction at her hands, she fought against and defeated the Religious Liberty bill,—a mild measure which granted to all denominations freedom in the practice of religious rites. In Spain the consecration of a Protestant bishop of Madrid has called forth protests and denunciations from the papal primate of Toledo, and also from the papal nuncio, and the whole country is excited. All the Spanish bishops, it is said, have uttered their minds, declaring the act to be "an outrage on the traditional rights of the Spanish Church," and also "a violation of Art. XII. of the Constitution." Meanwhile the head of the church, Leo XIII., from his seat of power and authority looks quietly on without a word of protest, or a syllable spoken in favor of that religious freedom of which the Catholic Church is alleged to be the friend and defender.

NO; religious freedom for Protestants is still an "outrage" upon Catholic "rights," and a "violation of the supreme law of the land." Consequently it is in order for the civil authorities in Spain to take the offenders in hand and deal with them as the law prescribes, or as it may be construed by a Catholic judge or jury. The only reason why this will (probably) not be done, is that enlightened public sentiment, both in that country and elsewhere throughout Europe, lays a restraining hand upon such extreme exhibitions of religious bigotry.

Notice, also, that since this "outrageous" act is punishable as a violation of the civil law, such punishment cannot, according to the logic of some who call themselves Protestants, be considered religious persecution, and as conviction and punishment for violations of the civil law was what sent Christians of the Dark Ages to the dungeon, the rack, and the stake, it follows from the same logic that Rome never really persecuted anybody, and that the millions of "martyrs" of that period were not martyrs, but only criminals. This is exactly what Rome claims. In this, as in other respects, she is the same to-day that she was then.—Present Truth, London, England, October 25.
