Last week I said that the true follower of God entreated, not compelled, men to turn and serve their Creator, and that it was the love of God that constrained him to do this. I want to show that this is the way God would have his work done. He is a God of love, and everything he does for man is done through love to him. God loves the sinner, but he hates the sin. He begs men to turn to him and live. His words are: "Turn ye, turn ye, from your evil ways; for why will ye die?"

But first let us see what is the character of God. This we find given by God himself in Ex. 34:6 and 7, in these words: "The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and fourth generation."

It is seen, then, that God is a just God. His character is love, and being just, he will have his work done in justice; his work will be a work of love. In his dealings with the children of Israel his love is shown throughout; although he led them into hard places at times, yet it was for their good, he knowing what was best for them. They were a rebellious people, but in all of God's dealings with them he never tried to force them to serve him. He won their love through manifesting his love in his dealings with them.

When they were in slavery in Egypt, God appeared to Moses, his servant, in a burning bush, and spoke to him in these words: "I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorows; and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey. . . . Now, therefore, behold the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. Come now, therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt." It is not necessary to go further with this story; suffice it to say, God brought forth the children of Israel as he promised Moses. It was necessary that they should be permitted to go into slavery, that they might see that the God of their fathers was a God of love; that they might know which was the best master to serve—God or Satan. But the love of God could not allow them to remain in slavery, for he had something better for them.

It is noticeable that in God's dealings with this people he never once used force to turn them to him. When he permitted any hardship to come upon them, he said it was that they might know that he alone was God.

When Moses went before Pharaoh, as commanded by God, he was to shew signs that the king might see that God had sent him. God might have destroyed Pharaoh and all the Egyptians with one word, but his love for mankind would not permit him to do this. His desire was to let the Egyptians know that he was the God of Israel, that they might turn to him. He suffers long with men, using every possible means to bring them to him; but he leaves them free to choose the way. If they choose the right way, eternal life is the reward; if they choose the wrong way, rebelling against him, eternal destruction is the end, not because God has failed to do all in his power to save, but because man has failed to accept him. It was so with Pharaoh; he rebelled against God, and did not hearken to him, but when Moses went before him, he said: "Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go." And so the plagues, bringing destruction upon them, were the result. And let it be understood that the plagues were not sent to turn the hearts of the people of Egypt to their Creator, for God knew, and in fact, told Moses, before he sent the first plague, that Pharaoh's heart would be hardened, and he would not obey and let Israel go. He requires heart-service, and when men turn to him through fear it is not a service of love. The plagues were sent for his people's sake. They were willing to be saved, but the Egyptians were not. It will be even so at the end of the world. God will destroy the wicked because they were not willing to hearken unto his voice. Force will not convert men; love and mercy will.

Many professed Christians today serve God because they fear the consequence of rebelling against him. The doctrine of everlasting punishment, that is, burning forever in a lake of fire, tends to drive men to a bondage of fear. It does not tend to draw men to the God of love, but they look upon him as an arbitrary, hard master, and many are turned from serving him altogether through this. The infidel continually throws this in the faces of those who try to teach him that God is love. But let me say, the Bible teaches no such doctrine. When God says he is a God of love, he means what he says, and in all his dealings with mankind his love is shown. Christ says: "No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me, draw him." How? through threats? No; through love. Love has a drawing influence. Threats and compulsion have not. When man is compelled to do a certain thing, he is a slave to the one who compels him; but we are free, for "whom the Son makes free, is free indeed."

Let us notice here how God showed his love to the children of Israel when Moses was sent to them to deliver them from the Egyptians:

And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice for they will say, The Lord hath not appeared unto thee. And the Lord said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod. And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. And the Lord said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand. That they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee. And the Lord said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into the bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow. And he said, Put thine hand into the bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh. And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also thee two signs, neither hearken unto the voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land. Ex 4:1-9

How different is God's way of drawing men to himself to man's way. What love is here shown. The carnal heart cannot understand the working of God. The carnal man would use compulsion where God would entreat, persuade. His great heart yearns for the sinner, yet he knows that to compel him to turn to him will make him no better. The heart cannot be changed by such a method. "Except a man be born again, he cannot enter the kingdom of heaven." Man can no more do this work than he can create; it is the work of God. It is done through the Spirit of God; man yielding himself to God as the clay yields to the hands of the potter. God's way is, "Come now, and let us reason together;" man's way is, "You must do as I say." The one is love; the other is selfish compulsion.
