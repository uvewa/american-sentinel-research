The Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Vaughan, has been speaking upon the reunion of Christendom, and is heartily in favor of it. The method which he proposes is simple and perspicacious: let every one come into the Roman Church; and there you are. As an argument toward this consummation, he urges that the divine origin of the Roman Church is certified by the unity into which it brings "men sharply divided by policies, national rivalries and aspirations." He compares this unity with the lack of unity in the Anglican Church. There are, he says, two bases of reunion. First, compromise, or mutual recognition. This is inconsistent with the divine constitution of the church. There remains only, second, submission,—that is, individual or corporate absorption. "Our hopes of a gradual submission by an ever-increasing number of Anglicans rest on evident facts," among which are the following: "The growing appreciation of Catholic doctrines and devout practices. The doctrines of the Catholic Church have been re-examined and taken back, one by one, until the Thirty-nine Articles have been banished and buried as a rule of faith. The real presence, the sacrifice of the mass, offered for the living and the dead, sometimes even in Latin—not unfrequent reservation of the sacrament, regular auricular confession, extreme unction, purgatory, prayers for the dead, devotions to our lady, to her immaculate conception, the use of her rosary, and the invocation of saints, are doctrines taught and accepted, I am told, with a growing desire and relish for them, in the Church of England. A celibate clergy, the institution of monks and nuns under vows, retreats for the clergy, missions for the people, fasting, and other penitential exercises—candles, lamps, incense, crucifixes, images of the blessed virgin and the saints held in honor, stations of the cross, cassocks, cottas, Roman collars, birettas, copes, dalmatics, vestments, miters, croziers, the adoption of an ornate Catholic ritual, and recently an elaborate display of the whole ceremonial of the Catholic pontifical,—all this speaks of a change and a movement toward the church that would have appeared absolutely incredible at the beginning of this century."—H. L. W., in the Baptist Examiner, Nov. 15.
