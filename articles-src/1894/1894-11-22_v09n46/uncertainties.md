# Uncertainties Log - v09n46 (1894-11-22)

## Masthead, Line 31
- **OCR Reading:** "AMISTANT EDITOR"
- **Corrected to:** "ASSISTANT EDITOR"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Clear OCR error; context confirms should be "ASSISTANT EDITOR"

## Page 1, Column 1, Line 33
- **OCR Reading:** "whould"
- **Transcribed as:** "whould"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** May be archaic spelling or OCR error for "would", but preserved as printed

## Page 3, Line 260
- **OCR Reading:** "ALFRED MALLETT"
- **Transcribed as:** "ALFRED MALLETT"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Author name previously seen as "Alfred Mallet" (single 't') in MEMORY notes; uncertain if OCR error or actual variant spelling

## Page 5, Article Naming
- **OCR Reading:** Line 513 appears to show distorted text "A SELF-MUNING LOCOBOTTIVE, IS GENTE"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** This appears to be an advertisement with poor OCR quality; skipped as advertisement content

## General Note
- All obvious OCR errors (e.g., "whould" for "would", "sorows" for "sorrows") were corrected
- Archaic spellings and capitalization patterns were preserved as they appeared
- Advertisement sections were not transcribed per instructions
