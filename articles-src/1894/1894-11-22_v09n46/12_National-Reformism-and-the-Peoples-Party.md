The prophet Daniel, standing on the mountain peak of prophecy, saw the great empires of earth (Dan. 2) come up and go down in succession, until a form of government came on the stage that was to "stand forever." In this second chapter the permanent government is called the little stone cut out of the mountain without hands. In the seventh chapter the prophet had a view of the same governments of earth rising and falling in succession, until a permanent one came on the stage which is called the "Ancient of Days." This name alludes to the fact that it is to be a government modeled after the Hebrew republic in which the masses chose their rulers, and Moses instructed them to "choose men who fear God and hate covetomeness." This "Ancient of Days," the prophet tells us to be a government in which the "people of the saints of the Most High should take the kingdom (government), and possess it forever and ever."

We are now witnessing in this closing decade of the nineteenth century what the prophet saw ages ago. The people are moving everywhere in the civilized world, to take the governments. The principles of the Omaha platform are in perfect harmony with the ten commandments and the sermon on the mount, while it is equally true that no man can vote for either of the old parties without thereby voting to sustain mammon worship.

Therefore, my fellow-countrymen, the lines are drawn, the issue is before you.

You cannot dodge it. Whom will you serve, God or mammon? The time is here when the God of heaven is going to set up a kingdom (Dan. 2:41) that shall never be destroyed. Will you aid in this heaven-ordained work?

We are living in the most interesting period of the world's history.

This conflict between the true worship of God and some form of idolatry has raged through all the ages.

Mammon worship is the last form of idolatry. It is the most refined, the most subtle, and most world-wide, and withal, the most powerful form that ever existed. But its end is near. It will die hard, but it must die. Reader, don't you want to have a hand in killing it? It is the greatest of all curses, the most blighting enemy of the human race. The sooner it dies the better. The People's Party is its only enemy, and it is the duty of every voter to vote for humanity and God.—Vineland (N. J.) Independent, Nov. 3.
