# Equal Rights.

Do all men have equal rights? if not, why not? If the great and just Creator of men bestowed inalienable rights, then all men must be equal in this respect; for we read he is no respecter of persons. The right to worship God according to the dictates of one's own conscience, without let or hindrance, by any man or set of men, is an inalienable right of every person in all the world. We have often heard the boast in this land of this privilege. This right is God-given, like the right to live. No man, or set of men, can deprive a person of this right. They may put shackles and hooks on him; they may ignore the principle and trample it under foot, yet the principle still exists; they may destroy the man, but the principle is indestructible. These rights are part and parcel of man's very being, and are necessary in order to his development and accountability. The untrammled exercise and use of these rights is also necessary to his safety and happiness. The great Creator has so ordered and arranged things that when any one exercises his rights and pursues them in their proper channel, there is no clashing.

The exercise of one man's rights does not necessarily interfere with any other man's. Every man may exercise all of his inalienable rights to the fullest extent without encroaching upon his neighbor. The exercise of any man's right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, or not to worship any god at all, should not, can not, and does not interfere with any other man doing, or not doing, the same thing. The untrammled exercise of one man's rights does no more interfere with that of another than does the breathing of the free air by one man interfere with that of another. A man is born with the right to breathe, and there is air enough for all. If every person was left to the fullest legitimate exercise of his rights, then truly this would be in truth the "land of the free and home of the brave." It takes valor of a very high type to practically concede to every man all the rights that one claims for himself. Pure and undefiled Christianity alone does this.

When this Government was established, John Adams said "there was a great point gained in favor of the rights of mankind." From a Christian and constitutional standpoint, no man can be deprived of the exercise of his indefeasible rights. And the fact that there are good citizens that are deprived of their inalienable rights or the exercise of them rather, is because the principles of Christianity and of the Constitution of the United States are disregarded. We make this query: Are there any persons in this country thus treated? We have only to refer to the States of Maryland, Tennessee and Georgia. Do these persons have equal rights with the rest of the people? They do constitutionally, but seem not to have judicially. To worship God as we please is an inborn right. These persons have been arrested, fined, imprisoned, and worked in the chain-gang for no other reason than because they have done that very thing, and which is perfectly harmless and innocent in itself.

Any law that would forbid the doing any innocent and harmless thing, certainly is based upon unsound principles. For the State or national Government to make it a misdemeanor to work on Sunday, certainly gives one religious denomination the advantage over another. To debar a man from work or any other civil pursuit on Sunday or any other day of the week, by civil law, is assuming that he is not capable of self-government. If it is done for a moral reason, it implies that morale or religion can be propagated by civil law. The Sunday law idea annihilates individual rights of conscience; and when that is done all acceptable worship or service is destroyed.

There is no way for civil government to settle the question, Which day is the Sabbath? Congress, while discussing the bill to close the World's Fair on Sunday, said, the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, is the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. But the commandment says the seventh day is the Sabbath. Congress certainly read between the lines, and read into the commandment something that God never put there.

The Constitution says Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. Most of the States have followed the example of the Federal Government in this regard. Congress shall set up, found, or ordain no religious establishment. Wherever any State, or Federal authority, has enacted laws favoring the idea that Sunday is the Sabbath day, and prohibiting all ordinary work on that day, there, to all intents and purposes, we have a law made respecting an establishment of religion, and prohibiting the free exercise of religion. We have a national confession of faith now in embryo. Congress has accepted the thesis that Sunday is the Sabbath, and defended it by argument, and established it by law. The dogma that Sunday is the Sabbath, is one of the articles of faith. Should a "Christian amendment" be passed by Congress, and ratified by the requisite number of States, then we would have another tenet of the national creed.

The acknowledgment of God in the Constitution would not guarantee fidelity to the principles of the Declaration of Independence and to the Constitution as it reads.

How can a man that loves his neighbor as himself, and worships God according to the dictates of his own conscience, favor the idea of prosecuting a brother, or a fellow-citizen, for doing the very same things? The great Teacher said, "And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise." When any professed Christian gives his sanction and approval to the arrest and persecution of any man who conscientiously keeps the seventh day and works the other six days of the week, he certainly cannot claim that he is in harmony with the Golden Rule, or that he loves his neighbor as himself. Then his Christianity becomes "sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal."

"Charity suffereth long and is kind; charity vaunteth not [is not rubi] itself." To compel a man to keep Sunday when he conscientiously believes Saturday is the Sabbath day, is the same thing as compelling him to keep two days.*

An intelligent Christian certainly will not surround his neighbor with such circumstances as to force him to disregard the law of his country or the law of his God. All will admit that it is better to disregard man's law than the law of God. Let us suppose that it takes all of six days in every week devoted to labor, in order that a man may be able to maintain himself and family, which no doubt is the case with a great many wage workers, and that the same man believes the seventh day is the Sabbath, as the commandment puts it, which no doubt is the case in some instances, and the Sunday law compels him to rest or be idle on the first day of the week, then we have a man that is robbed of the inalienable right of the pursuit of happiness and is compelled to either disregard the law of the land or the law of God in order to get a living. O tempora! O mores!!
