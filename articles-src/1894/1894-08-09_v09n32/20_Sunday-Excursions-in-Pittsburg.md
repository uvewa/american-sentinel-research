The number of cheap Sunday excursions on railroads centering in Pittsburg, Pa., has been greatly increased this season. This is a boon to the poor laboring people who cannot get out of the city on any other day. But it is none the less distasteful to those who have a religion that cannot be maintained without law. Mr. Crafts says that "religion cannot be maintained without the Sabbath, or the Sabbath without law." It follows that such religion is dependent on civil law for existence, and hence is not the religion of the Lord Jesus Christ, for that not only has been maintained without civil law, but in spite of such law.
