Seventeen members of a baseball club were recently fined at Dayton, Ohio, for playing ball on Sunday. "The Christian people of Dayton," says a National Reform paper, "declare their intention to put a stop to playing on Sabbath." That is they mean to use the civil law to enforce their counterfeit Sabbath upon all the people.
