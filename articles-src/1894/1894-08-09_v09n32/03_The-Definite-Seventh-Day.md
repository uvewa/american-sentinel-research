# The Definite Seventh Day.

When God said, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work," he designated a definite day to be observed alike by all men. To suppose, as some claim, that the Sabbath of the Lord has not a particular, specified place in the succession of days which make up the months and years of time, but is any one day out of seven which men may chance to select for rest and worship, is to charge God foolishly. "God is not the author of confusion," nor has he left it to the caprice or self-interest of man to determine the day upon which his Sabbath shall be kept. Of this he has given us abundant evidence in his word.

The Sabbath is God's rest day. It was instituted at creation; for, "in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it." From the creation, therefore, each recurring seventh day has been the day upon which God rested, and therefore the Sabbath day; for any day upon which God did not rest could not be his Sabbath. While any day can be one day out of seven, only one day can be the one on which he rested; and that day, as he tells us, is the seventh day.

Notice also the language of the Sabbath commandment: "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates." God rested on the first seventh day, and thus pointed out and fixed the seventh day in the calendar of our first parents, Adam and Eve. The children of Adam and Eve did not inaugurate a new reckoning, but learned from them which day was the seventh day, and thus it has been with all the people of God from that day to this, for each parent would, in obeying the Sabbath commandment, be obliged to instruct both son and daughter, manservant and maidservant, in their duty to refrain from work on the Sabbath day. So long as the commandment was observed by parents, there could be no question about which day was the Sabbath in the minds of the children; and had the commandment not been violated, no question of that nature could ever have arisen. But God has always had at least a few faithful followers in all ages of the world, and through these the definite Sabbath day has come down to us, which God pointed out at creation.

During the forty years' wandering of the children of Israel in the wilderness, God designated by miracles the day which was his Sabbath; for on the sixth day he sent a double portion of manna from heaven, and withheld all manna on the seventh day, and preserved what was kept over from the sixth day to the seventh, so that it was not corrupt, as it would have been on other days. If there had been any disposition on the part of the Israelites to select their own Sabbath day,—to choose any one day in seven, as some people claim the right to do now, it must have been effectually corrected by this emphatic testimony from the Lord. And that testimony has lost none of its force at the present time. If the Sabbath was a particular, definite day then, not left to be determined by the choice of man, it must be so now. God does not change, his law does not change, and the obligation of man to his law does not change with the lapse of years.

The seventh day has never lost its identity from creation down to the present time. The day, marked by the unchanging revolution of the earth, and the week, marked by the six days of creation and the seventh day Sabbath, are divisions of time marked off by God himself; and they have continued unchanged through all the ages. The seventh day of the week is the days of Adam, is the seventh day of the week at the present time, as it ever has been. "The Sabbath day according to the commandment," which followed the "preparation" day and immediately preceded the first day of the week at the time of the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ (Luke: 23:54-50; 24:1), is the Sabbath day according to the commandment now. And happy is he who is willing to accept and observe the day God has designated, rather than a day that has been chosen by man.—Present Truth, London, England.
