# Church and State.

### The Law of the Sabbath Interpreted by Mortals.

At a National Reform convention held in 1873, the Rev. Jonathan Edwards, D.D., said: "We want State and religion and we are going to have it." And Prof. C. A. Blanchard in another convention said: "Congress must establish a standard of religion, or admit anything called religion." And Rev. D. A. Gault, a district secretary of the association, said: "We propose to incorporate in our national Constitution the moral and religious command 'in it [the Sabbath] thou shalt do no work,' except works of necessity, and by external force of sheriffs we propose to arrest and punish all violators of this law." Here is a clear statement of their intentions. Let these ideas be put into concrete form as they desire, in the law of the land, and anathema would soon follow against all dissenters. They deny any desire for a union of Church and State, but deny as they may, the above is an absolute confession.

But suppose the law of the Sabbath, the fourth commandment, should be incorporated in the law of the land, what would be the result? It would then become civil law; and civil law must be interpreted by the courts, by Congress, by judges, and juries. This would be to presume that the Creator could not give a law in an intelligent manner, and so must be left to the wisdom of man to decide its meaning. And then not to man in his individuality to recognize or refuse the claims of his Creator; but it would place courts and Congress above individual rights, above individual conscience, above God himself, for God has left these free to all men to exercise each for himself. It would take away the right of private judgment. It would destroy man's individuality, his responsibility to his God. It would make the State supreme. It would destroy man's independence of character, and make him a servile slave to a religio-political despotism. It would revive the terrors of the Inquisition.—H. F. Phelps, in Renville Star-Farmer, Minn.
