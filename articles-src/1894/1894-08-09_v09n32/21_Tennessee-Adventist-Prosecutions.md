Depending the prosecution of Adventists under the Sunday law of Tennessee, not as made by the legislature but as made by the courts, the News, of Paris, Tenn., says:

The fact of the matter is that all denominations are right, looking at it from each peculiar standpoint. But if a man or the people do not see as others do, the people or the courts of the State should not be slandered because of that fact. The time will never come when any religious denomination can force its teachings upon the people if they do not want to receive such doctrines. Let the law be enforced upon all alike.

When, let us ask, have the wicked Adventists tried to force their teachings upon the people? That is just what they complain of in the State of Tennessee, namely, that the civil law is there invoked to force upon them the Sunday institution in which they have no faith. They know that it is antichristian, but the courts of Tennessee declare Sunday to be a Christian institution, that it must be observed for that reason. It is the State of Tennessee that is trying to force its religion upon the Adventists, and not the little handful of Adventists in Henry County who are trying to force their religion upon the State, or people, of Tennessee.

Again, the News says: "Let the law be enforced alike upon all." Then why is it not done? Why are Adventists the only victims? The editor of the News knows, if he is not blind, that the Sunday law of Tennessee is violated every week in his own town; but how many of the violators have been prosecuted since the advent of the News to Paris? If the courts of Tennessee are zealous alone for the majesty of Tennessee law, why does not their wrath strike some of the larger offenders as well as the Adventists in their retired country homes?
