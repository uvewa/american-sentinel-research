# No Longer Astonished.

The worst phase of the present situation is that nothing surprises any one. Senators are examined as the pupils in a school when a pocket-book is stolen, every one called up and searched! All departments are being investigated and evidences of corruption are appearing on every side; what would once have set the country on fire with righteous indignation and fear are now stated as matters of everyday occurrence.

"And what will ye do in the end thereof?"—New York Christian Advocate.

And worse yet, nobody is righteously indignant. The only reason such things are questioned at all is to make political capital for the party making the excess.
