The Sun, one of the most influential papers of this city, if not the most influential, had in its issue of Sunday, July 15, this significant paragraph:

But if the unification of all the forms of Christianity by ecclesiastical ties and through an acceptance of a common body of doctrine, may be deemed impracticable, there is no doubt that the era of religious rancors and sectarian antipathies has almost passed away, the only vestiges of it being the persecution of the Jews in eastern Europe, and the occasional foolish attempts to excite suspicion and jealousy of the Catholic Church in Canada and the United States. Unquestionably the time is ripe, or soon will be, for a moral cooperation of all men calling themselves Christians, against revolutionary teachings which threaten the destruction alike of religion and of civilization. The necessity of such a combination against anti-social forces has been repeatedly affirmed by Leo XIII., and is proclaimed with special anxiety and fervor in what perhaps will prove to be his last encyclical.

This is just the direction that events are taking. The Catholic Church sets itself forth as the great conservator of society, the preserver of social order, the only power that can control the masses. In the dire distress that is coming upon the nations, they will turn to this wicked power for salvation; and they will imagine that they get it too, and will then cry "Peace and safety;" but then sudden destruction shall come.
