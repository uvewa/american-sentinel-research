# The Connecticut Blue Laws.

To the Editors of The Outlook:

I note on page 30 in your issue of the 7th inst., under heading of "The Connecticut Blue Laws," you say, in answer to your correspondent, that they "owe their origin to a certain Hugh Peters."

I think this a fresh evidence that "even respectable newspapers sometimes make mistakes," as you say in the beginning of the same article.

The first publication of the celebrated "Blue Laws" was in a book published in London, England, in 1781, entitled "A General History of Connecticut; by a Gentleman of the Province." The authorship was then attributed to, and afterward acknowledged by, the Rev. Samuel A. Peters, LL.D., who was known as "The Tory Parson." He was born in Hebron, Conn., 1735; graduated at Yale, 1757; ordained in England, 1759; rector of Episcopal Church in his native town 1760-1774, when he fled to England, returned to this country in 1806, died in New York City in 1826. His holy rests in the churchyard in his native town.—B., in The Outlook.
