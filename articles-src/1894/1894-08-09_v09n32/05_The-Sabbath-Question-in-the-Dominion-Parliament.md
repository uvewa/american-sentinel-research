**The Sabbath Question in the Dominion Parliament.**

*(Concluded.)*

The honorable gentlemen must remember that in proposing his bill he acts not only contrary to the constitution which I read a moment ago, but also contrary to the general understanding which prevails in this country and which was summed up in a proclamation by Her Majesty the Queen in 1858, which is as follows:

> Firmly relying ourselves on the truth of Christianity, and acknowledging with gratitude the solace of religion, we disclaim alike the right and the desire to impose our convictions on any of our subjects. We declare it to be our royal will and pleasure that none be in anywise favored, none molested or disquieted by reason of their religious faith or observance, but that all shall alike enjoy the equal and impartial protection of the law; and we do strictly charge and rejoin all those who may be in authority under us that they abstain from all interference with the religious belief or worship of any of our subjects, on pain or our highest displeasure.

These are the words not only of the Queen, but of the Parliament of Great Britain. This is the rule which should be recognized in this country. We should not interfere with the religious belief of our neighbors. Everybody should enjoy complete liberty, provided that liberty does not interfere with the liberty and civil rights of others. But the honorable gentleman wants to force those who are not of the same belief with himself to observe as the Sabbath some other day than that which they believe to be the Sabbath, and even to force those who, like himself, desire to observe Sunday, to observe it in the way he believes in, and not in the way they believe in themselves. That is not protection of civil rights; it is interference with civil rights. Mr. Speaker, I do not wish to take up too much of the time of this House, but I have given briefly the reasons why I oppose the bill: First, because the bill is unconstitutional; second, because it is useless if it were constitutional, because the provinces take charge of these matters; and third, because the bill is an undue interference with the belief of others.

By this bill we claim jurisdiction in religious matters. I have objected to that already, but being in the minority, I can do nothing but submit for the moment. In the second place, by this bill we assert that Sunday is the Lord's day. I have already given the name of a very respectable religion which holds the contrary view, and I challenge the mover of the bill to show where in the Bible he finds that Sunday is the Lord's day. I quoted the Old and the New Testament against the honorable gentleman's contention. Will he allow this opportunity of answering the challenge to pass—he who is the champion in this House, the athlete, fighting in favor of a principle? Will it be said all over the Dominion and the world, that a member of the legislature in this House could not find in the Bible any text to authorize his assertion that Sunday, or the first day of the week, is the day chosen by our Lord for a day of rest? It is all very well for the honorable gentleman to remain silent, but he thus gives a victory to his adversaries. The Seventh-day Adventists will cast up at him, wherever he may be, that he was not able to defend himself against one who is not a member of his religion. I have proved by the Old Testament that the Sabbath is on Saturday, and not on Sunday, that God did not rest before his work was done but after it was done, and I have challenged him to find any passage in the New Testament where the Son of God gave orders to celebrate the first day of the week instead of the one chosen by his Father. I challenge the honorable gentleman in the name of the Seventh-day Adventists and of the Jews, to reply. Is he impotent? It is all very well for honorable gentlemen to laugh, but there is the weak point, and if he is not able to answer, it must be said that the champion of this House, advocating the keeping of the Lord's day, could not furnish any good ground for his advocacy.

As I have said, by this bill we are assuming to have jurisdiction in religious matters. I contend that it is the provinces, and not the Parliament, which has such jurisdiction. In the second place, while the honorable gentleman asserts that the work on the Lord's day is against the law, by this amendment, to which he consents, he says: "The law of God is all very well, but we will not follow it whenever we think it is not in our interest to do so. God said: 'You must observe the whole of Sunday.' That is all right, but we will cut the day short, and take from the Sunday the amount of time required for our business; and the governor in council will have the power, four weeks in advance, to say that three weeks hence there will be such a press of business that we will have to disobey the law of God and let prevail the law of man." For my part, I am against all this legislation. I believe it is not our duty here to occupy ourselves with religious legislation. That has been left to each individual. Each individual has the right to worship his God as he thinks proper, provided he does not interfere with the liberty of any one else.

Q., and printed in the un revised 'Harvard' No. 49, and in the revised edition, columns 3640-3641. Published in the House of Commons on Sunday, May 30, 1854. Reprint: The Dominion Parliament, 1858.

*Mr. Amrst contended in the first part of his speech that the proposed legislation was unconstitutional because the British North American Act, clause 66, subsection 13, says:

> "Property and civil rights in the provinces will be the exclusive right of the Provincial Legislature.

Since the honorable manner of the bill had declared in a speech at the introduction of the bill that the measure was "designed to make for the purpose of this country, and to make for the purpose of which the Amrst argued that, therefore, the Dominion Parliament was forbidden by its constitution to legislate concerning the matter.
