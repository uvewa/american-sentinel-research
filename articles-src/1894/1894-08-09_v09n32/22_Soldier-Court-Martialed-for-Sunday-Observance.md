The St. Louis Globe-Democrat gives the following particulars of a case alluded to in these columns a week or two since:

Charles O. Cedarquist, private, Company A, Second Infantry, stationed at Omaha, Neb., has been found guilty of disobeying his superior officer in refusing, because of religious scruples, to attend target practice on Sunday, and to-day the court-martial jury returned its verdict, and the accused was sentenced to be confined at hard labor for a period of six months and to forfeit to the United States $10 per month of his pay for the same period. This is the first time such a case has arisen in the annals of the army, and the decision and finding of the court-martial established a precedent for future cases of similar nature. The case has attracted a great deal of attention in army and religious circles.

The defense was practically limited to the contention that the order, in respect of which disobedience was charged, was an unlawful one in that, first, it enjoined a duty to be performed on Sunday, in violation of orders and regulations limiting Sunday labor in the army to the measure of strict necessity, and, second, that the act required to be done would have been a violation of Section 341 of the Criminal Code of Nebraska. The decision says:

"That a commanding officer has a discretion under existing orders to require target practice by his command on Sunday in case of necessity is undoubted. The evidence in this case fails to fix upon the commanding officer any abuse of discretion in the issue of the order complained of by the accused. The legality of that order and the obligation of the accused to obey it when duly transmitted to him cannot be questioned. It was not for him to judge of the necessity for the issuance of the order. The discretion pertained to his commanding officer as to whether one existed, and, whether erroneously or not, it was the duty of the accused to obey. It is conceded that soldiers stationed at Belleview Rifle Range, Nebraska, who, as individuals, engage in hunting and shooting on Sunday would be within the provisions of the sections referred to and liable to its penalties, but after careful consideration the reviewing authority is of the opinion that the State could not make, nor has it by this section or any other legislation to which his attention has been called, attempted to make the performance on Sunday of target practice or any other duty pertaining to the instruction and discipline of the army a criminal offense."

The occasion is deemed opportune for inviting the attention of the department to the fact that the obligations of military service will never permit a soldier to refuse obedience to an order because in his judgment it is unnecessary.

It does not appear whether or not this man took the proper course in endeavoring beforehand to be excused from attending target practice on Sunday; but if he did, the officer is clearly in the wrong. The man had a perfect right to keep Sunday, and in time of peace there is absolutely no reason why he could not have been permitted to do so. The Government has no more right to require men to render such service in violation of their consciences than it has to require them to keep Sunday when they don't want to.
