# Another "Faribault Scheme."

The controversy which has taken place at Syracuse, N. Y., in regard to leasing a building, which has just been erected by the Roman Catholics, and which is designed for school purposes, is a reminder that the Church of Rome is still endeavoring to advance the interests of that church at the expense of the public school system.

Last fall St. Lucy's parish completed the erection of a school building. Shortly after the completion of the building a written proposition was submitted to the Board of Education requesting them to make use of the building for public school purposes, for which a nominal rental of one dollar per year was to be paid by the city. The Board of Education was requested to pay the salaries of teachers and meet the other expenses of maintaining the institution as a public school. The original proposition was that only Catholic teachers should be employed in the school, but the written proposition submitted to the board contained no such limitation. The principal argument adduced in favor of the proposition to employ Catholic teachers was that it was a hardship upon the Catholic portion of the community to be compelled to contribute toward the support of the public school system, and also to provide for the maintenance of parochial schools for the religious education of their children. The written proposition brought out so much opposition and so much feeling was developed over the affair that the advocates of the measure saw that it would not receive the sanction of the Board of Education, and the day before the proposition came to a vote, the vicar-general stepped in and withdrew the whole proposition.

An effort was also made by several of the teachers to introduce the reading of the Catholic version of the Bible in their divisions. The board requires that teachers read daily from the Holy Scriptures, without specifying particularly the version to be used; and although copies of the authorized version are supplied to all the schools with the expectation that they would be used, several of the Catholic teachers interpreted this requirement of the board as giving them the right to make use of any version they saw fit, and substituted the Catholic Bible. Upon being questioned concerning it, some of the teachers stated that they had been told by the vicar-general that he understood there would be no objection to their using the Donay version. When the matter was considered by the board, it was decided that only the authorized version could be used, and the teachers were instructed to use the Bible provided by the State, and if any change was desired, application must be made to the board for permission to make such change.
