# A Correction.

In the first notices that appeared in regard to the imprisonment of W. B. Capps, it was stated that he would be imprisoned for a year and nearly four months. But when the severity of the sentence was fully realized, and the papers began to comment upon it, it appears that the clerk of the supreme court looked over his records to see whether some mistake had been made, and on second calculation he found that the fine was not so heavy.

The figures as published were based upon the official statement of the clerk of the supreme court, which statement is now on file in our office; but a later statement from the same official tells us that the aggregate fines and costs in both the supreme and lower courts amount to $68.65 which will reduce the term of his imprisonment to about nine months instead of a year and four months, as at first stated.

A. O. TAIT,
Cor. Sec. of the I. R. L. Association.
