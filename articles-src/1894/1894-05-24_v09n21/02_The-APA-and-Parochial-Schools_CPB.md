SOME months since in pointing out what seemed to him to be dangerous features in the American Protective Association, the writer said:—

"The Catholics, plotting to secure public money for the support of their denominational schools, are a menace to our free institutions. But is it any better for the A. P. A. to invoke the power of the State to compel the Catholics to educate their children in the State secular schools instead of in the parochial religious schools?" And again: "The A. P. A. scheme, which proposes to subordinate the Church to the State, would make it possible for the State to forbid the individual to render to God the things due him. The Catholic regards it as a religious duty—a service due to God—to educate his child in the parochial school; the A. P. A. would have the State say: You shall not educate your child in this way, but you shall send him to the public school in order that the State may have his first and best affections, and the Church and Him whom the Church represents, the second place in his heart." Our conclusion was: "The A. P. A. should see to it that in its efforts to preserve civil and religious liberty, it does not destroy both."

For these utterances the writer was taken severely to task by certain correspondents who denied that the A. P. A. advocated any such scheme, and who asserted that so far as the A. P. A. was concerned the papist might educate his child where he pleased; and we were challenged to either retract the offensive statement or else furnish proof to sustain it. The former we would not do because we believed our statement true; the latter we could not do because the A. P. A. being a secret organization it is difficult to prove just what its purposes are. Moreover, while having seen from A. P. A. sources, declarations which to our mind fully justified our statement, we could not at the time lay our hands upon them. But recently there has come to hand an article which was first published in the *New Era*, an A. P. A. paper, and subsequently republished, without comment, in the *American Standard* (May 5, 1894), another A. P. A. organ, which fully justifies all that we said, and shows that zeal for a good cause (the preservation of American institutions) is leading the A. P. A., or at least certain A. P. A. papers, into the advocacy of principles as utterly ruinous to both civil and religious liberty as are the principles of the papacy itself. The article in question is as follows, the italics only being introduced to call attention to the salient points:—

## American Logic.

The handful of Italians who are running the papacy, have shown great skill in prolonging the contest, and after three centuries of constant warfare it can show a great army of ignorant and superstitious dupes to do its bidding. The world is asking: What is the destiny of the papacy? Will she again send us to school to muttering monks? Consign to hell all who dispute her authority? We answer no! a thousand times, no! We cannot let her teach loyalty to Rome, and disloyalty to our Republic. The schoolmaster must be reinforced by the strong arm of the State. We must profit by the example of papal States who have rebelled against priestcraft. We must drive her dupes from our schools, where employed as teachers, compel her youth to attend the State schools, make it felony for a papal priest to in any way interfere in keeping a child from the State schools; if they denun; object, tell them to get out of this land dedicated to civil and religious liberty, and return to their Italian masters who have neither power nor respect for the country they ruled and plundered for ten centuries.

We leave it to the candid reader if this does not bear out the statement that it is proposed to deny to Catholics the right to educate their children in their own schools; and if it does not justify the caution given months ago by the writer, namely, that the A. P. A. should have a care lest in its efforts to preserve liberty it does not destroy it.
