APROPOS of the article on another page, "Some Signs of the Times," is the following paragraph from the Review of Reviews, for May:—

The European nations are beginning to droop and totter beneath the ever accumulating burden of military expenditure. There is hardly a country among them that is not at the present moment struggling desperately to choke the deficit which is starting it in the face. In England, Sir William Harcourt was five million pounds ($25,000,000) short, which must be provided for by new taxation. The Indian Empire is proposing to tax all imports, except cotton, five per cent. ad vaterem, to meet its deficit, besides adopting other expedients unpopular but necessary. In France, there is a deficit of nearly $80,000,000, about half of which it is proposed to cover by a refunding of loans at a lower rate of interest, and the remaining half is to be obtained by increased taxation on incomes and spirits, with taxes on succession duties. In Italy, the new finance minister frankly admits the existence of a deficit of about $50,000,000, to be met no one knows how. The country cannot bear increased taxation, and the chances of any minister who ventured to propose serious retrenchment and the disbanding of surplus employés would be practically worthless. Everywhere the statesmen are seeking with feverish anxiety for new sources of revenue, but everywhere the insatiable maw of armaments demands more and ever more millions.

As we have before remarked, the recognition of impending ruin has become well-nigh universal.
