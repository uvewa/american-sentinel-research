RECENT advices, from Rome, by way of London, state that "the congregation of the Propaganda has gathered all the necessary material for immediate and direct intervention between Ablegate Satolli and his opponents in the United States. It is probable that another national Synod of the American hierarchy will be ordered for the purpose of directing Catholicism in the United States. The opinions of religious orders now being obtained greatly favor the appointing of cathedral charters and a permanent legate in the United States."
