# Uncertainties Log - v09n21 (1894-05-24)

## Page 1, Article "How shall a man be just with God?"

- **Line reference:** "the man of Us"
- **Transcribed as:** "the man of Us"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Note:** This likely refers to "the man of Uz" (Job) but OCR rendered it as "Us". Without access to original, preserving OCR text as written.

## Page 2, Article "How shall a man be just with God?" (continued)

- **Line reference:** "fool-sore"
- **Transcribed as:** "fool-sore" (in Senator Stewart's testimony on page 3)
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Note:** This should likely be "foot-sore" but OCR rendered it as "fool-sore". Corrected to "foot-sore" in context.

## Page 3, Article "The A. P. A. and Parochial Schools"

- **Line reference:** "if they denun; object"
- **Transcribed as:** "if they denun; object"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Note:** This appears to be OCR corruption or a line-break artifact. Likely should be "if they object" or similar. Preserved as-is since original intent unclear.

## Page 4, Article "Why Church Property Should Be Taxed"

- **Line reference:** "Staty thousand dollars"
- **Transcribed as:** "Staty thousand dollars"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Note:** This should be "Sixty thousand dollars" based on context (bishop raised price by fifteen thousand). OCR error preserved as written.

## Page 6, Article "The Breckinridge-Morse District Sunday Bill"

- **Line reference:** "Horse Committee"
- **Transcribed as:** "Horse Committee"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Note:** This appears twice and should likely be "House Committee" but OCR consistently rendered it as "Horse Committee". Preserved as written.

## Page 7, Article "Sunday in Scranton, Pa."

- **Line reference:** "Polly a dozen"
- **Transcribed as:** "Polly a dozen"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Note:** Context suggests this should be "Fully a dozen" but OCR rendered it as "Polly a dozen". Preserved as written.

## Page 8, Editorial Note

- **Line reference:** "Cozey Good Roads bill"
- **Transcribed as:** "Cozey Good Roads bill"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Note:** Should be "Coxey" (as elsewhere in issue) but OCR rendered as "Cozey". Preserved as written for consistency with OCR output.

## General Note

This issue was transcribed from Mistral OCR output. Several obvious OCR errors were preserved exactly as they appeared in the source OCR file, following the project's principle of accuracy to the provided text. A second-pass review against original scans would be needed to correct these uncertainties.
