THE New York Catholic School Exhibit was formally opened by Archbishop Corrigan, before an audience of about two thousand people in the Grand Central Palace on the evening of the 15th inst. The main floor and the two galleries were densely packed with men, women, and children, while on the stage sat nearly two hundred of the clergy, together with a number of prominent laymen. Speeches were made by the archbishop, Mayor Gilroy, Congressman Bourke Cockran and others. Mayor Gilroy, said that one of the proudest aims of man or woman ought to be to teach the youth of the country how to exercise the rights of citizenship when they came to man's estate. "The parochial schools," he said "are doing this." The phenomenal success of Tammany proves that Mr. Gilroy knows whereof he affirms.

"A roar of applause," says the Sun (Tammany organ), "went up as Mgr. Farley announced Bourke Cockran. Mr. Cockran said that he was amazed that at this part of the nineteenth century it was found necessary to repel the charge that the Catholic Church was hostile to republican institutions. "To declare," said he, "that the Catholic Church is hostile to the Republic is to declare that the mother is hostile to her own offspring. The Catholic Church is the oldest republic in the world, and has been always favorable to such institutions." That we suppose will settle the matter with many people. Mr. Cockran, a member of Congress, has said so, and who can longer doubt it? But once granted that the Catholic Church is mother of the Republic, must it not follow that the mother must control the child?
