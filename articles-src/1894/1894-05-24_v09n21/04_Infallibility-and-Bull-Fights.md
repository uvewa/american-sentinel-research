The greatest religious question in Spain just now is not the authorship of the Pentateuch nor the authenticity of the fourth Gospel, but the question as to whether or not Roman Catholic priests should attend bull-fights! So important in all its bearings is this momentous question that the pious priests were unable to decide it for themselves, and were compelled to have recourse to the illuminated counsel of the Holy See. The grave doubts which had been fostering for some time in the consciences of the clergy were recently tabulated by the Bishop of Ciudad-Rodrigo, and submitted to his infallible holiness, Pope Leo. Let all Christianity blush, and nineteenth century enlightenment reel took into medieval darkness as we listen to the answers received from the oracle at Rome! Translated from the Latin they are as follows:—

1. That a priest may not attend a bull-fight if he have the sacred oil with him.

2. That a priest may take the sacred oil to some private place near the scene of the sport, ready for use in case of necessity, provided that he use caution so that his presence may not be taken as indicating approval of the spectacle.

3. That a priest may not (is not obliged to) attend a bull-fight, even though custom expects him to do so.

Such a compromise between good sense and absurdity is seldom to be found. One has only to attempt to imagine the presence of St. Paul, or any of the apostles at one of these disgraceful scenes, where bovine gore is mixed with the life-blood of a human being to delight the depraved taste of the cruelty-loving spectators, to see how far the Romish Church has departed, both in spirit and practice, from the primitive Church of Christ and its founders.
