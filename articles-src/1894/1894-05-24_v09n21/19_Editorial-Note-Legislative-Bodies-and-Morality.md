THE Observer, of this city, remarks that "men cannot be made either moral or religious by act of Parliament or Congress," and then immediately adds: "But legislative bodies may help, as they are disposed to make transgressors' ways more or less easy to enter." This is a most mischievous sentiment. Legislative bodies have no other duty than to provide for the conservation of natural rights; to guarantee to all "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." To go beyond this is inevitably to enter the domain of conscience and to trench upon sacred rights.
