SCRANTON, Pa., is agitated over the enforcement of the Sunday law of 1794 in that city. According to the Scranton Tribune, "a score or more of agents in the employ of the Pastor's Union, which is conducting the Sunday closing movement, were quietly circulating about the city," on Sunday, May 6. As stated by the Tribune, beer and similar drinks could be procured by those who knew how to get them, but "to the credit of the executive committee of the Pastor's Union, nearly all of the corner penny stands were closed, as well as a number of bakeries and candy stores." Sunday evening Rev. F. Dony, district secretary of the American Sabbath Union and president of the executive committee of the Pastor's Union of Scranton, said to a Tribune reporter: "We are perfectly satisfied with the way our work is progressing. I know that many places are open, but they will close because they must close."

Monday, May 7, the ministers held a meeting in the interests of the Sunday-closing movement which was addressed by one, Colonel Boise, who said:—

This local movement depends in a great measure upon prevailing popular sentiment which must emanate from the pasture. A former similar movement in this city was successful because it awakened the co-operation of the entire Christian community. In the same way only will this movement be successful.

While I defend the Sabbath as a sacred day that should be exempt from worldly business, I do not believe in a Sabbath of needless exactions.

If we let the enemies of Sunday go on unhindered, Christianity will tremble. There is just as much necessity to enforce Sabbath observance as any other divine command.

The address closed with a round of applause.

The executive committee submitted a report, one paragraph of which is as follows:—

One arrest has been made of a person who defied the law and challenged its enforcement. Arrangements have been made for a considerable number of like cases to be proceeded against for yesterday's disregard of the law if in the judgment of the Pastors' Union it is advisable to continue the work.

"It was advisable," "in the judgment of the Pastors' Union," "to continue the work," and so the Tribune, of May 9, tells of the infliction of a fine of four dollars on one Mr. McGarrah, a druggist, who sold soda water, and closes with this remark:—

Polly a dozen prominent druggists and cigar dealers will be brought before Alderman Post this afternoon, and the chances are that each will receive the usual fine of $4 and costs.

These druggists were so brought before the alderman, and each was fined four dollars and costs. On the 12th, which was the seventh day of the week, and according to the Scriptures the Sabbath of the Lord, still other fines were imposed in the interest of Sunday sacredness and to awe people into a more strict observance of the papal Sunday, the rival of the divinely appointed rest day, the memorial of creation, and consequently, of God's power to redeem.
