A FREETHOUGHT exchange, attempting to make a point on a note in our columns, asks: "Why should there be any mystery about righteousness?" Well, there should not be, but the fact remains that there is. There never would have been any such mystery had sin never entered the world; for God's will, which is perfect righteousness, would have been perfectly done in all created intelligences. But sin having once entered and all flesh being contaminated by sin, the mystery is the restoration of men to a condition of complete harmony with God. This change is wrought by the power of God. The apostle exhorts: "Be not conformed to this world; but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God." Man's work is to desire the good; it is God's work to confer that good by the renewing of the mind, the transformation of the character, the formation of "the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness."
