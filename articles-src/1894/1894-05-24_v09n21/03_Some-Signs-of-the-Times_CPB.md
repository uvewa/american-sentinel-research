For years the people of this country have been familiar with various forms of labor agitation, but neither in this nor in any other country can an exact parallel be found to the so-called "Coxey Movement," called by its originator "The Commonweal of Christ."

It is true that in other countries and in other ages men have marched in bodies to the seat of government, there to demand, in one form or another, redress of real or imaginary grievances; but never has anything of this kind been done on a scale so large and so suggestive of widespread discontent as in this country in this the closing decade of the nineteenth century.

Speaking in the United States Senate, on May 10, Senator Gordon, of Georgia, said:—

Mr. President. Looking at this Coxey movement from a Southern standpoint, it appears to me to have in it and in the facts about it a lesson which we might wisely and gravely ponder. This movement had its inspiration doubtless in what we call paternalism, a theory of government which tends to enlarge the brood of such movements in the future, and to intensify the demands of that class of people upon Congress for relief. Strangely enough this movement had its origin in one of the great central, populous, progressive States of the Union, among a people justly noted for their intelligence, their loyalty to law and order, and for their well-considered enterprise and well-directed energy. Its divisions and corps are moving upon this Capitol from every quarter of the compass save one. From every section of this Union save that one section they are coming, and we are confronted with the marvelous spectacle of portions of the people in every section except in one turning a listening ear to the appeals of Mr. Coxey and his lieutenants. The section in which the commonweal army, as it is called, has received few or no recruits is the South. This fact is marvelous, I repeat, by reason of its isolation, and monumental by reason of the political lesson which it presents.

The same day and in the course of the same discussion, Senator Teller said:—

Mr. President, I myself am of the opinion that the present distressed condition of the country, which is unusual, that the present distressed condition of the world, which is unusual, is the result of positive legislation. . . The present condition ought at least to make the American legislator stop and reflect. . . Our attention has been attracted to the discontent and dissatisfaction everywhere, and it will not do for senators to say this is only a small sprinkling, only a few of the people of the country who are discontented. Go to Omaha, go to Council Bluffs, where these unfortunate people are making their way from the extreme West to this city. They had the support and sympathy of the entire laboring population of those two cities. I think I may say here, without contradiction, that wherever they have gone in the towns in the rural districts, everywhere they have had the sympathy and the support of the people of those communities.

Mr. President, there never has been an hour in American history, in the great panics that preceded the panic of 1893, when there has been so much poverty, so much distress, so much danger to the Republic as there has been in the last year. It is growing worse and not better, and we have not put our hands to a single thing in this Congress that in my judgment is calculated to relieve the condition. . . The outlook is not bright for the distressed; it is not bright for the American farmer and the American laborer, who compose nine-tenths of the American people. If we can not do anything else, if we can not help them in any other way, we can at least show some sympathy with them. I deny that Coxey represents the great mass of the people, but I insist that he represents a sentiment of dissatisfaction and discontent which is very prevalent and very general in this country. . . I do not know myself absolutely that anything that we can do will bring prosperity to this country. I do not know that anything that we can do alone will lighten the burden of these people. I am of the opinion that we could accomplish it; but other people whose judgment is equally entitled to respect, and perhaps is better than mine, do not think we can. We can not agree, Mr. President, first, as to the trouble, and secondly, as to the remedy; but we could agree, it seems to me to say to those people, "We will look into your condition; we will take your case into consideration; and if we can find any way to grant you relief, we shall exercise our judgment and do our best."

Senator Stewart bore a like testimony, as follows:—

Mr. President, to my mind the situation of the country presents a condition which demands careful and serious consideration. There has been no time in the history of the United States when discontent was so general as now. The movement of the so-called Coxey's army has developed a sentiment of unrest to a marvelous extent. They are now forming home guards of the Coxey army and marching in many States. The senator from Oregon [Mr. Mitchell] told me yesterday that a few days ago 5,000 home guards of the Coxey army were marching in the city of Portland, in his State. So the papers are full of it every morning, showing the universal discontent, and they all attribute it to the same cause—hard times, want of employment. The evidence that such a state of things exists is multiplying day by day.

The outlook is indeed gloomy, the more so, because, as stated by Senator Teller, the present depressed condition is worldwide. Industrial stagnation has seized upon all nations, and the "toiling millions" everywhere feel the bony fingers of want clutching at their very vitals. And worst of all, statesmen, instead of supplying a remedy, confess their inability to even certainly point out the cause. There is "upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity;" and "men's hearts are failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth."

But it is not alone in peaceful marches to the Capitol City that the discontent of the masses is manifesting itself. Strikes on every hand, almost universally accompanied with violence resulting in bloodshed and destruction of property, testify not only the dire distress of the people, but their determination not to suffer alone. The worst passions of men are being aroused; real wrongs are being supplemented in the minds of untold thousands by imaginary wrongs until to many the choice seems to lie between abject slavery with bare subsistence and open revolt with all its dire probabilities. Men are growing desperate and reckless of consequences.

As reported recently by the Washington Post, and referred to by us last week, "General" Coxey said, in a public speech the day of his conviction in the police court in Washington:—

This country is like a big bunch of straw, and all that is necessary to start it into a roaring blaze is the torch. Do you dream that in court to-day the torch was applied? We came here as an army of peace. God knows violence is the last wish of any member of this army, but I fear that the match has been applied, and that time alone will tell what is to be the outcome. If violence does follow the consequences will not be on our heads, for others were the cause of it. It now looks to me as though it would be useless to try and accomplish anything more in the line of public reformation by peace.

Violence may not immediately follow the arbitrary action of the Washington police authorities, but the discontent and desperation has been largely increased. The confidence of the people in those entrusted with the Government has been rudely shaken. "General" Coxey's words may be set down as "only the utterance of a crank;" but crank though he be, in the words of Senator Teller, "he represents a sentiment of dissatisfaction and discontent which is very prevalent and general in this country." And whether justified or not, the general discontent is fast ripening into a sense of injustice and oppression. In the United States Senate, on May 10, as reported on pp. 5522 and 5523 of the Congressional Record of May 11, Senator Stewart said:—

The Coxey army tramped for hundreds of miles in a peaceable, orderly manner, which attracted the attention of the whole country. They came here poor, fool-sore, and hungry. They remained in line and obeyed orders, not one of them moving from the line. A most sad spectacle, calculated to excite the sympathies of all who saw them. They marched up the avenue to the other side of the Capitol and there stood in line. Many senators and representatives stood on the steps of the Capitol. I was among the number. I did not see what occurred further east at the end of the Capitol, but I saw Coxey coming up to the front and step upon the first steps of the east entrance of the Capitol, and I saw policemen meet him. There was a consultation. I did not hear it, but they motioned to him in the usual way to move back. He moved back and went to his carriage. They put him in his carriage, the vehicle he came in, and he ordered his men to march back, and without entering the Capitol grounds they marched back.

That he committed no offense against the law was apparent to every one who witnessed it. . . Now he has been charged and convicted in the police court, of what? He has been charged and convicted of wearing a badge. . . Then another charge was made by some. He was charged with stepping on the grass. I have read the evidence right along; it was very conflicting. I think the charge was not sustained, but perhaps it makes no difference whether it was. . . Now I undertake to say that conviction was for no substantial offense. If the assembling of those masses of people and marching in the streets is a crime, then there ought to be some law to punish it. We had understood that it was not a crime; that everybody had the right to do it; but certainly, whether they have a right or not, the law authorities them to do so, and it is well understood that they have this right. . . Now, here is a man convicted of those things in a court of justice in a case that has attracted universal attention. All the people of the United States know that Mr. Coxey was convicted when he had committed no offense; that he was convicted under a pretense that he had committed an offense when he had not done so. . . No, it will be construed by the whole country that this was an attempt to punish the movement by construing a harmless act into an offense. That will not do. We must have equal justice in this country. I do not think a more disgraceful exhibition of petty tyranny has ever been exhibited than the prosecution of Mr. Coxey. The others I did not see. I saw what he did with my own eyes. I saw him come and I saw him go.

He came quietly and went away quietly. That was perfectly obvious to the thousands who saw him. And he was convicted in the national capital for an offense that he did not commit. That is certain, and that will be the verdict of the American people. It looks like an attempt to punish a great movement by committing a judicial outrage. If we expect to govern a free people by law we must let them know and feel that the laws are just. The laws, when justly administered, are omnipotent, because all the people say they shall be thus administered.

Public opinion justifies the administration of law and supports the strong arm of Government and nothing else, and when thus administered according to the common sense of mankind, when justice is administered, all the American people say amen. But to exhibit here a conviction for no offense, or if an offense technically one so petty that it would be in any other place dismissed by the police magistrate without a word, the fact that they could get a jury in the national capital and a judge to perform such a service is a blow at the foundation of law and order.

It will be noticed that the senator does not justify the Coxey movement; nor do we; we give these facts only because they are facts which cannot be ignored. But what must be the effect of such facts, and of their recognition and statement at the seat of Government, in the very halls of legislation? Men felt before, however mistakenly does not matter, that they were the victims of grave wrongs, that they had just cause of complaint and just grounds upon which to demand redress of grievances; but how must they feel now? When instead of being granted a hearing by their representatives they are treated as trespassers and criminals and are subjected to indignity and injustice? Are not the most serious consequences likely to ensue? Yes, unless conditions speedily change, must they not inevitably ensue? Is not our nation resting upon a volcano ready to break and overwhelm it in social and political ruin?

There is a grave danger in the Coxey movement in its entirety, but grave as it is a greater danger lurks in the paternal theory of Government which is responsible for it. Paternalism is a cause; Coxeyism is only an effect.

Government is established only as a conservator of human rights. Government does not create wealth; its province is not to distribute wealth; it does not even possess wealth independently of the people, for all that it possesses comes from the people; hence what Government gives to one it must take from another. Coxey's demand for good roads to be constructed in the various States by the general Government, is only a demand that the general Government shall by taxation confiscate a portion of the property of one class of citizens to distribute in the form of wages among the members of another class. The scheme is chimerical and mischievous, but it is not our purpose to discuss it at this time. We wish simply to call attention to facts as they exist, and to connect them with the inspired declaration that "in the last days perilous times shall come." 2 Tim. 3:1. Such times have come. There is peril on every hand; peril to life and property, to civil society and to the Church of God, to the individual and to the body politic. There is peril on land and on sea. In storm and flood, in calamities by land and by sea the year 1893 was the most disastrous ever known, and 1894 threatens to be as prolific as its predecessor in those things which cause men to quail in terror as before superior forces. The Mail and Express, of May 10, has this in its editorial columns:—

## Ten Thousand Victims.

When Matthew, the apostle, declared that "there shall be earthquakes in divers places" he added that "all these are the beginning of sorrows." That was long ago, but . . . to-day, as in the oldest time, there are earthquakes in divers places. Last month these direct of nature's convulsions were shaking and rending Japan. Afterward historic Greece suffered from seismic shocks of the most appalling nature, which are perhaps not yet ended. On the day that the first of these calamities affrighted Greece a shock was felt at Colon and other places on the Isthmus of Panama.

To-day we have the news of the most appalling earthquake of the present year. Venezuela has been the scene of its work, and the cities of Merida, Lagunillas, Chiguara, and San Juan, in the northwestern portion of that country, are reported to have been wholly destroyed. More woful than the obliteration of these cities is the assertion that ten thousand people have lost their lives. The details of this greatest of calamities have not been received. All that is known is that the earthquake occurred at 11 o'clock at night. Probably nearly all the victims were asleep, and were precipitated from the slumber of rest into that which knows no terrestrial waking.

The human mind can conceive no more terrible occurrence than this. The unfortunate people were resting from their work of the day wrapped in slumber, all unconscious of danger. The subterranean forces of nature made one effort and these ten thousand men, women, and children passed from life to death in the twinkling of an eye. The lot of the living friends and relatives is almost as lamentable. True they have life, but most of that which makes life valuable has gone. Some are the sole survivors of families. Others are suffering from grievous injuries. They live but are without means of livelihood. They appeal to the charity of the world, which must be quickly given to make it effective.

This calamity takes first place among the disasters of this woful year.

When Matthew, the apostle, wrote the words quoted, he was simply recording the declaration of our Lord. The disciples had asked Jesus two questions, namely, when should Jerusalem be destroyed, and what should be the sign of his second coming and of the end of the world. Among the signs given were those referred to by the Mail and Express. Luke gives additional particulars (21:25, 26):—

There shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; men's hearts falling them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth; for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.

The signs in the sun, in the moon, and in the stars are in the past, and now we are witnessing the "distress of nations with perplexity;" the "sea and the waves roaring;" and "men's hearts falling them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth." The next event in order is the coming of the Son of man "with power and great glory." But what saith the Scripture, of these signs:—

When these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh. And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees; when they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand. So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand. Verily, I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled.

The generation that learns the parable of the fig tree will see the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. "Heaven and earth shall pass away," says our Lord, "but my words shall not pass away." And then he gives this warning:—

Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.

Shall we not heed his words?

C. P. B.
