THE Philadelphia Record contributes this bit of humor to the Sunday observance discussion:—

OLD LADY.—Now, I'll give you a quarter if you'll promise to become a Christian.

RAGGON TATTERS.—Well, ma'am, I'll promise you never ter work on Sunday.

There is an acidity in this witticism which is not misplaced.
