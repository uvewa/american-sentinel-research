DURING the consideration of a District bill in the House, on the 14th inst., some excitement was caused by a colored man in the public gallery. The man arose and addressed the speaker, saying that if the Cozey Good Roads bill was not passed, the White House, Treasury, and Capitol would be destroyed by thunder and lightning. Of course, the man is what is popularly known as a "crank," but so was Guiteau, and so was Valliant, who threw the bomb in the French Chamber of Deputies. "Crankism" is one of the signs of the times and is in the very air.
