One of the acts passed by Congress at its recent session and signed by the President, reads as follows:—

In it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Commissioners of the District of Columbia are hereby authorized and instructed, on the petition of the president and directors of Gonzaga College, the owners of all the property fronting on that part or portion of an alley twenty and seventeen one-hundredths feet wide, and running east and west through square six hundred and twenty-two, for a distance of five hundred and sixty and seventy-five one hundredths feet, beginning at and running west from west line of North Capitol street about equidistant between 1 and ½ streets northwest and extending to the west boundary line of the property of the said president and directors of Gonzaga College in said square to declare said part or portion of said alley to be closed, and the title therein is hereby declared to be vested in the president and directors of Gonzaga College.

Approved, June 19, 1894.

The land thus donated to a Roman Catholic institution is said to be valued at $27,500. Other Catholic institutions in Washington received appropriations in various sums:—

For the Washington Hospital for Foundlings, for final aid toward maintenance, six thousand dollars.

For the Church Orphanage Association of St. John's Parish, maintenance, one thousand eight hundred dollars.

For the German Orphan Asylum, maintenance, one thousand eight hundred dollars.

For the National Association for the Relief of Destitute Colored Women and Children, maintenance, including its care of colored foundlings, nine thousand nine hundred dollars.

For St. Anne's Infant Asylum, maintenance, five thousand four hundred dollars.

For St. Joseph's Asylum, maintenance, one thousand eight hundred dollars.

For the Association for Works of Mercy, maintenance, one thousand eight hundred dollars.

For House of Good Shepherd, maintenance, two thousand seven hundred dollars.

For the Industrial Home School, maintenance, nine thousand nine hundred dollars.

For St. Rose's Industrial School, maintenance, four thousand five hundred dollars.

A Government institution, "the Board of Children's Guardians," got only $17,000, instead of $50,750, as proposed by the committee.

The SENTINEL has protested, and will continue to protest, against all such donations, whether of land or of money, and whether made by the Government of the United States or by the Governor of Mashonaland; for if the principle is worth anything it is just as good in the wilds of Africa, as on the plains of our own fair West or in the alleys of our Capital City.
