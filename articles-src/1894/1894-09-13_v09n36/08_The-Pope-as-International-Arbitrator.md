An important article is to be found in the Civiltà Cattolica on the question of international arbitration in connection with the memorial which, as a result of the Chicago congresses, has been issued by the United States Government to all the governments of the civilized world. This document prays that they will unitedly agree by mutual treaties to submit for settlement by arbitration all such international differences as shall fail of satisfactory solution by ordinary diplomatic methods. The Civiltà hails the step as one of extreme significance, and speaks of it, indeed, as "little less than gigantic;" by it the question of international arbitration ceases to be a mere private matter, and has become a universal question in which all the governments of the world are interested. The institution, declares the Jesuit writer, of such a high court of international justice would of itself be sufficient to immortalize our century.

# MORAL LAW THE ONLY BASIS.

Coming to ways and means, the article discusses the basis on which arbitration should be built up. Mere utility would not be sufficient, would not compel the assent of nations in moments of fierce rivalry. The basis must be the higher one of moral right, which alone possesses the two indispensable qualifications of universality and invariability. Great and small, strong and weak, must all feel that they are on a precisely equal level in the eyes of the arbitrators. Public opinion, too, must come to their support, and hence no time should be lost in cultivating popular sentiment in favor of this all-important subject of permanent peace.

To the question of who is to arbitrate the Civiltà declares frankly that only one answer is possible. The pope must act as arbitrator; he alone possesses in his person the indispensable qualifications:

1. His power is spiritual and, therefore, more removed from mere political considerations than that of any other monarch.
2. The pope is habitually an old man and calibate, devoid of family ties and uninfluenced by passion.
3. He is compelled to take as his model in the eyes of the world that divine Prince of Peace, whose representative on earth he is.
4. Whereas the increase of their temporal estates is the great aim and object of all sovereigns, the sole glory of the pontiff consists in the open defense of truth and right.
5. The decisions of the pope are likely to be accessible to all, even to those who do not recognize his religious domination as being those of a great moral power.

Seek for and find, if you can, concludes the writer, any man who can give higher pledges of integrity than these.—Review of Reviews, for July.
