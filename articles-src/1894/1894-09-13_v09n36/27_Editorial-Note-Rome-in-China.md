THAT octopus, the Roman Catholic Church, is fastening its tentacles even upon heathen China. The Monitor, a Catholic paper published in San Francisco, boasts that "another indication of the importance to which the Church has attained in China is the appointment of a Catholic bishop to be a mandarin of the third class. This bishop is the Right Rev. Mgr. Auger, Bishop of Telepte, Vicar- Apostolic of Southern Chantong. He is now one of the officials of the Chinese empire, and is held in the highest esteem by all classes."

But it is not the political influence or even supremacy of Rome that is most to be feared. It is her soul-destroying doctrines which should be shunned, for they "drown" souls "in perdition," while civil authorities can, at the worst, only enslave men's bodies and destroy their lives.
