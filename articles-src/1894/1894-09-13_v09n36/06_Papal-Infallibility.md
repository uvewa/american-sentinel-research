(Concluded.)

[This matter first appeared in an anonymous pamphlet published and circulated in Italy immediately following the Vatican council of 1870, which proclaimed the dogma of papal infallibility. The pamphlet purported to be a speech delivered in the council "by a bishop," against the dogma. However it is not published on the strength of its having been delivered "by a bishop," for this is denied, but it is reprinted solely on its own merits.]

Monsignor Dupanloup, in his celebrated Observations on this council of the Vatican, has said, and with reason, that if we declare Pius IX. infallible, we must necessarily, and from natural logic, be obliged to hold that all his predecessors were also infallible. Well, then, venerable brethren, here history raises its voice with authority to assure us that some popes have erred. You may protest against it, or deny it, as you please, but I will prove it.

Pope Victor (192) first approved of Montanism, and then condemned it. Marcellinus (296-303) was an idolator. He entered into the temple of Vesta, and offered incense to the goddess. You will say that it was an act of weakness; but I answer, a vicar of Jesus Christ dies, but does not become an apostate. Liberius (358) consented to the condemnation of Athanasius, and made a profession of Arianism, that he might be recalled from his exile and reinstated in his see. Honorius (625) adhered to Monotheitism; Father Gratry has proved it to demonstration. Gregory I. (570-90) call any one antichrist who takes the name of universal bishop, and contrariwise Boniface III. (607-8) made the parricide Emperor Phocas confer that title upon him. Pascal II. (1088-99) and Eugenius III. (1145-55) authorized duelling; Julius II. (1509) and Pius IV. (1560) forbade it. Eugenius IV. (1431-59) approved of the council of Basle and the restitution of the chalice of the church of Bohemia. Pius II. (1456) revoked the concession. Hadrian II. (867-872) declared civil marriages to be valid; Pius VII. (1800-23) condemned them. Sixtus V. (1585-90) published an edition of the Bible, and by a bull recommended it to be read. Pius VII. condemned the reading of it. Clement XIV. (1700-21) abolished the order of the Jesuits, permitted by Paul III. and Pius VII. re-established it. But why look for such remote proofs? Has not our holy father, here present, in his bull which gave the rules for this council, in the event of his dying while it was sitting, revoked all that in past times may be contrary to it, even when that proceeds from the decisions of his predecessors? And certainly if Pius IX. has spoken ex cathedra, it is not when, from the depths of his sepulchre, he imposes his will on the sovereigns of the church.

I should never finish, my venerable brethren, if I were to put before your eyes the contradictions of the popes in their teachings. If, then, you proclaim the infallibility of the actual pope, you must either prove that which is impossible, that the popes never contradicted each other, or else you must declare that the Holy Spirit has revealed to you that the infallibility of the papacy only dates from 1870. Are you bold enough to do that? Perhaps the people may be indifferent, and pass by theological questions which they do not understand, and of which they do not see the importance; but, though they may be indifferent to principles, they are not so to facts. Now do not deceive yourselves, if you decree the dogma of papal infallibility, the Protestants, our adversaries, will mount in the breach the more bold that they have history on their side; whilst we have only our own denial against them. What can we say to them when they show up all the bishops of Rome, from the days of Luke to his holiness, Pius IX? Ah! if they had all been like Pius IX., we should triumph on the line, but alas! it is not so. (Cries of "Silence, silence; enough, enough!") Do not cry out, monsignori. To fear history is to own yourself conquered; and, moreover, if you made the whole waters of the Tiber pass over it, you would not conceal a single page. Let me speak and I will be as short as it is possible on this most important subject.

Pope Virgilius (538) purchased the papacy from Bolisarius, lieutenant of the Emperor Justinian. It is true that he broke his promise and never paid for it. Is this a canonical mode of binding on the tiara? The second council of Chalcedon had formally condemned it. In one of its canons you read "that the bishop who obtains his episcopate by money shall lose it and be degraded." Pope Eugenius III. (IV. in original) (1145) imitated Virgilius. St. Bernard, the bright star of his age, reproves the pope, saying to him, "Can you show me in this great city of Rome any one who would have received you as pope if they had not received gold or silver for it?" My venerable brethren, will a pope who establishes a bank at the gates of the temple be inspired by the Holy Spirit? Will he have any right to teach the church infallibly? You know the history of Formosus too well for me to add to it. Stephen XI. made his body be exhumed, dressed in his pontifical robes; he made the fingers which he had used for giving the benediction be cut off, and then had him thrown into the Tiber, declaring him to be a perjurer and illegitimate. Look how matters were readjusted. Romanus, successor of Stephen, and after him John X. rehabilitated the memory of Formosus.

But you will tell me these are fables, not history. Fables! Go, monsignori, to the Vatican library and read Platina, the historian of the papacy, and the annals of Baronius (A. D. 897). These are facts which, for the honor of the holy see, we should wish to ignore; but when it is to define a dogma which may provoke a great schism in our midst, the love which we bear to our venerable mother church, Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman, ought it to impose silence on us? I go on.

The learned Cardinal Baronius, speaking of the papal court says (give attention, my venerable brethren, to these words): "What did the Roman Church appear in those days—how infamous, only all-powerful courtesans governing in Rome? It was they who gave, exchanged, and took bishoprics; and, horrible to relate, they got their lovers, the false popes, put on the throne of St. Peter."—(Baronius, A. D. 912). You will answer—these were false popes, not true ones: let it be so; but in that case, if for fifty years the see of Rome was occupied by anti-popes, how will you pick up again the thread of the pontifical succession? Has the church been able, at least for a century and a half, to go on without a head, and find itself acephalous? Look now! The greatest number of these anti-popes appear in the genealogical tree of the papacy; and the absurdity it must have been that Baronius described; because Cenobrardo, the great flatterer of the popes, had dared to say in his Chronicles (A. D., 901), "This century is unfortunate, as for nearly one hundred and fifty years the popes have fallen from all the virtues of their predecessors, and have become apostates rather than apostles."

I can understand how the illustrious Baronius must have blushed when he narrated the acts of these Roman bishops. Speaking of John XI. (931), natural son of Pope Sergius and of Marozia, he wrote these words in his annals: "The holy church, that is, the Roman, has been vilely trampled on by such a monster."

John XII. (936), elected pope at the age of eighteen, through the influence of courtesans, was not one bit better than his predecessor. I grieve, my venerable brethren, to stir up so much filth. I am silent on Alexander VI., father and lover of Lucretia; I turn away from John XXII. (1519), who denied the immortality of the soul, and was deposed by the holy Ecumenical council of Constance. Some will maintain that this council was only a private one; let it be so; but if you refuse any authority to it, as a logical sequence you must hold the nomination of Martin V. (1417) as illegal. What, then, will become of the papal succession? Can you find the thread of it? I do not speak of the schisms which have dishonored the church. In these unfortunate days the see of Rome was occupied by two, and sometimes, even by three, competitors. Which of these was the true pope?

Resuming once more: again I say if you decree the infallibility of the present bishop of Rome, you must establish the infallibility of all the preceding ones, without excluding any; but can you do that when history is there, establishing with a clearness equal only to that of the sun, that the popes have erred in their teaching? Could you do it and maintain that avaricious, incestuous, murdering, simonical popes have been vicars of Jesus Christ? Oh, venerable brethren, to maintain such an enormity would be to betray Christ worse than Judas; it would be to throw dirt in his face. (Cries, "Down from the pulpit, quick; shut the mouth of the heretic!") My venerable brethren, you cry out; but would it not be more dignified to weigh my reasons and my proofs in the balance of the sanctuary? Believe me, history cannot be made over again; it is there, and will remain to all eternity, to protest energetically against the dogma of papal infallibility. You may proclaim it unanimously; but one vote will be wanting, and that is mine. The true faithful, monsignori, have their eyes upon us, expecting from us a remedy for the innumerable evils which dishonor the church: will you deceive them in their hopes? What will not our responsibility before God be if we let this solemn occasion pass which God has given us to heal the true faithful? Let us seize it, my brethren; let us arm ourselves with a holy courage; let us make a violent and generous effort; let us turn to the teaching of the apostles, since without that we have only errors, darkness, and false traditions. Let us avail ourselves of our reason, and of our intelligence, to make the apostles and prophets as our only infallible masters with reference to the question of questions, "What must I do to be saved?" When we have decided that, we will have laid the foundation of our dogmatic system. Firm and immovable on the rock, lasting and incorruptible, of the divinely inspired Holy Scriptures, full of confidence, we shall go before the world, and like the Apostle Paul, in the presence of the free-thinkers, we will "know none other than Jesus Christ and him crucified." We will conquer through the preaching of "the folly of the cross," as Paul conquered the learned men of Greece, and Rome, and the Roman Church will have its glorious '89. (Clamorous cries—"Get down! Out with the Protestant, the Calvinist, the traitor of the church!")

Your cries, monsignori, do not frighten me. If my words are hot, my head is cool. I am neither of Luther, nor of Calvin, nor of Paul, nor of Apollos, but of Christ. (Honowed cries—"Anathema, anathema to the apostate!") Anathema! monsignori, anathema! you know well that you are not protesting against me, but against the holy apostles, under whose protection I should wish this council to place the church. Ah! if covered with their winding-sheets they come out of their tombs, would they speak a language different from mine? What would you say to them when, by their writings, they tell you that the papacy has deviated from the gospel of the Son of God, which they have preached and confirmed in so generous a manner by their blood? Would you dare to say to them—We prefer the teaching of our own popes, our Bellarnine, our Ignatius Loyola, to yours? No, no: a thousand times no; unless you have shut your ears that you may not hear, closed your eyes that you may not see, blunted your minds that you may not understand. Ah! if he who reigns above wishes to punish us, make his hands fall heavy on us, as he did to Pharoah, he has no need to permit Garibaldi's soldiers to drive us away from the eternal city. He has only to let them make Pius IX. a god, as we have made a goddess of the Blessed Virgin. Stop, stop, venerable brethren, on the odius and ridiculous incline on which you have placed yourself; save the church from the shipwreck which threatens her, asking from the Holy Scriptures alone for the rule of faith which we ought to believe and profess. I have spoken; may God help me!
