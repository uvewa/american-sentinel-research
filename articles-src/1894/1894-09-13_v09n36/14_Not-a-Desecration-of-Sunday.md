The Populist leaders arrested at Indianapolis for holding a political meeting last Sunday were released yesterday, as the prosecution could not make out a case of Sunday violation against them. In all probability that was a false pretense, and the real motive of the arrest was to embarrass them in their missionary work. There is nothing which would aid it more effectively. They know that, and court martyrdom. And in that they do not differ from the leaders of any other party, past or present, which thinks its mission is to change the world in a day, and by methods reserved for it alone. If it was not false pretense it was plain stupidity, such as has been exemplified in this neighborhood in a similar way lately. But everything is grist that comes to the Populist mill, and they will profit by their sufferings, real or alleged. Give them a free field and they will wear themselves out with their own vehemence. Make martyrs of them and they will thrive.—Pittsburg Times, Aug. 14, 1894.
