A strange story of religious persecution comes from Tennessee. Were not the alleged facts as stated apparently well authenticated, the occurrence would seem well-nigh incredible. . . . That any State in the American Union should inflict penalties for the exercise of inoffensive religious belief is inconsistent with its part in the lofty life and light which should be the portion of a free, self-governing people. It is to be hoped that the publicity of this event will lead to a revulsion against the injustice of laws which make such persecution possible, and that legal reforms will be instituted that will ultimately prevent the perpetration of such outrages under the guise of the law. No mediavial religious(?) relics are now needed.—The Progress, Minneapolis, Minn.
