An original link and fac-simile of the chain which bound St. Peter were recently placed in their final depository in St Mary's Cathedral, Burlington, Vt., in the presence of a distinguished congregation. Many archbishops and bishops were present in the sanctuary, and in the body of the church were seated a score or so of men prominent in national affairs, many of whom were non-Catholic.

In the morning Archbishop Corrigan officiated at Pontifical Mass.—Catholic Times, Aug. 25.
