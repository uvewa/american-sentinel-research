We have said before that these Saturday-Sabbath people are the worst enemies of the Lord's day we have to contend with in our effort to secure a quiet Sabbath; it looks from this that they are the worst enemies the State has to contend with in its battle with anarchy.—Christian Statesman, Sept. 1, 1894.

This is just what "these Saturday-Sabbath people" have expected for forty years. We have all that time known from the Scriptures of Truth that those who were loyal to God's Government would be denounced as enemies of civil government. The following quotation from "Great Controversy," page 409, proves that we have been looking for just this thing:—

Those who honor the Bible Sabbath will be denounced as enemies of law and order, as breaking down the moral restraints of society, causing anarchy and corruption, and calling down the judgments of God upon the earth. Their conscientious scruples will be pronounced obstinacy, stubbornness, and contempt of authority. They will be across of disaffection toward the Government. Ministers who deny the obligation of the divine law will present from the pulpit the duty of yielding obedience to the civil authorities as ordained of God. In legislative hall and courts of justice, commandment-keepers will be censured and misrepresented. A false coloring will be given to their words; the worst possible construction will be put upon their motives.

But Adventists are not the enemies of civil order; and to all such accusations, whether from pulpit or press, they reply in the words of Elijah to the wicked Ahah: We "have not troubled Israel; but thou and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the Lord, and hast followed" the man of sin by observing his false Sabbath.
