Notwithstanding the fact that papers in sympathy with Romish supremacy in this country are continually denying the statement that Roman Catholics are organizing military companies all over the land and arming them, yet the organization of the companies continues and the military force at the command of the Roman hierarchy continues to increase in all the cities in this land. In this city nine companies have already been organized and the daily papers state that before long it is expected that six more will be organized. These fifteen companies are to compose a regiment to be known as the "First Regiment of Dismounted Artillery of the League of the Cross."

These companies will be under regular military drill. They will carry the national colors and in addition have a regimental flag, consisting of a white cross in the center, with a blue back-ground. Their colors will indicate that they are American citizens who owe their military allegiance to Rome. "Father" Montgomery is the leading spirit in having these military companies organized in this city, and the purpose of the organization he doubtless understands better than those on the outside. It will be observed that the name of this organization is "The League of the Cross." This shows that its primary object is to defend Romanian. If any think that the pictures heretofore drawn of the work of Romanian have been overdrawn, we ask them what means all this battle array? It should be remembered also that what is being done in San Francisco is only a sample of what is done in other cities.—San Francisco Harbinger.
