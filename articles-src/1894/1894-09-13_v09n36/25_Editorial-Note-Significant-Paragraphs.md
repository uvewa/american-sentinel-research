We introduce this week a new feature into the SENTINEL, namely, a department of "Significant Paragraphs" without note or comment, and without expressed approval or dissent. The intelligent reader will have no difficulty in supplying his own comments and this he can do at any length, while we are necessarily limited by our space. We believe that this will be an interesting feature of the paper, and we invite our readers to assist in making it so by sending us pertinent facts and opinions on live topics bearing upon religious liberty. To be of any value the name and date of papers from which clippings are made must be given in every instance.
