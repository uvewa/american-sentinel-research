If any man imagines that the days of religious persecution are passed, he should at once disabuse himself of any such foolish idea. It is true men are not now for conscience' sake put upon the rack or burned at the stake, but they are often in different parts of the country, North and South, subjected to social ostracism, to obloquy and abuse in several of the States, notably in Arkansas, Tennessee, Georgia and Maryland people of the sect known as "Adventists," have been fined and imprisoned for working on Sunday when they had already "kept" Saturday or the Sabbath. That these have been cases of purely religious persecution is shown by the fact that other men who worked on Sunday were not molested.

We have no language adequately to express our contempt and detestation of such work. This is the boasted land of religious liberty, and no man's religion, or want of religion, should cut any figure whatever as regards his standing socially, politically, legally, or in a business way.—Silver Creek (Neb.) Times.
