In view of the fact that those who have been so zealous in their efforts to bring about Sunday laws for the last quarter of a century have, in such positive terms, declared that it was purely a civil movement and not in any sense a religious one, it is passing strange that the editor of the Midland (United Presbyterian), in commenting upon the case of Private Cedarquist (who was court-martialed and sentenced to six months' imprisonment, with loss of pay, by Major Worth, at Fort Omaha a short time ago, for refusing to engage in target practice on Sunday, and whose case was appealed and re-appealed until it reached President Cleveland, who overruled the sentence and ordered a court-martial to try Major Worth) should make the following statement:—

"The comments of the daily papers on the case have been in utter disregard of the principles of justice. The statement that Jews or Seventh-day Adventists might refuse to work on Saturday, and be excused, is childish. This is a Christian nation, and we have Sabbath laws, not only national, but in nearly all the States. In becoming part of a Christian nation, all of these must submit to righteous Christian laws. Major Worth has clearly violated the laws of the State of Nebraska and of the nation, as well as explicit army orders, and should be dealt with accordingly.

Then, when it is supposed to be generally known that this Government is of the people, by the people, and for the people,—wholly a man-made institution, it is strange that the above paragraph should appear in the same paper from which the following is taken:—

When Christian people look at the financial condition of our country, and of the civilized world, is it not time for us to all "Cease from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for wherein is he to be accounted of?" and turn wholly to the Lord, and "Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee, and then shall glorify me." This is very plain, easily understood, and can be carried into practice daily by every child of God whose heart is filled with the Spirit.

We ought to have this part of God's Word impressed upon our hearts so it will remain there and control us ever. "Thus saith the Lord: Curved be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departed from the Lord, for he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh, but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land not inhabited. Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is." When the Lord's voice crieth so loudly and long to the land by adverse providences, the man of wisdom ought to see his name and point it out distinctly and repeatedly to others, so that all may turn to him.

Again, when the Bible plainly says that "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work" (Ex. 20:10), it is very strange that Private Cedarquist should persist in refusing to perform military duties on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday; and that he, the editor of the Midland, and the President of this "Christianity nation" should all hold the erroneous idea that Sunday is the Sabbath.†

Then again, it is exceedingly strange that in a paper in which Sunday is spoken of as the Sabbath one would be able to find such language as is next quoted:

The servants of God must know, obey and submit to the will of God in all things as the angels do in heaven. . . . The moral law, as a rule of life, is original and absolute, universal and permanent. It has never been abrogated. Christ came, not to destroy, but to fulfill, not to abolish, but to establish the law. We are under this law to Christ. God reveals his will in the precepts of his Word. These must be obeyed. . . . As the Saviour said, when the cup of sorrow was given him: "Not my will, but thine be done."

Strange it is also that a law enforcing the observance of a day which is nowhere in the Scriptures said to be the Sabbath should be called a "righteous Christian" law; and strange indeed is the idea that even the obedience of a truly righteous law should be enforced, when the Word teaches that willing service is the only kind that God accepts.

"Wee unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered." Luke 11:52.
