THE article on "Saint Worship," on page 282, will be a revelation to many. So-called Protestantism has become so indifferent to the errors of Romanism that it has largely lost sight of them, so that thousands of people are ignorant of what Roman Catholicism really is. A careful reading of the article referred to will reveal the fact that instead of being Christian, Romanism is essentially pagan, and that its invocation of saints, instead of honoring the Creator, is as verily idolatry as is the ancestral worship of the Chinese.
