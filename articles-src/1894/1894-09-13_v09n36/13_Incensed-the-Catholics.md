WASHINGTON, Aug. 21.—Some days ago dispatches from Mexico announced that Rev. H. R. Moseley, a Baptist minister, had been imprisoned at Santillo as the result of publishing a pamphlet entitled, "Three Centuries of Romanism in Mexico." As the Mexicans, who profess any faith, are generally Catholics, this publication caused a great excitement in the country, and it is probable the reverend missionary was arrested by the authorities to preserve him from harm quite as much as to punish him. At any rate they made no objections when United States Consul Donnelly requested his release, and the Consul-General notified the State Department by telegraph that he had escorted the minister safely across the borders.—San Francisco Examiner, Aug. 22.
