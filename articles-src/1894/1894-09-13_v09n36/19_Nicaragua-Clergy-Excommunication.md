The New York Herald's correspondent in Leon, Nicaragua, sends word that the clergy there proclaimed from the pulpit the excommunication of the editor of the liberal newspaper, "1893," and forbade Catholics to read it. Several priests have been arrested in consequence, and will be expelled from the country. Great excitement prevails.—Catholic Times, Aug. 25.
