BUFFALO, N. Y., August 24.—Sister Mary Benedict left the Convent of the Good Shepherd to-day for the first time in six years. The Mother Superior of the order brought her into the superior court upon a writ of habeas corpus, made on the affidavit of Mrs. Louise Huppchen, who alleges that her daughter, who is known as Sister Mary Benedict, is restrained there against her will. The girl entered the order in 1888. It is one of the close convents of the Roman Catholic Church, and the inmates are not permitted to see their relatives or to have any communication with the outside world.

Sister Mary showed no desire in court to-day to rejoin her parents. No testimony was taken, as the nuns were not represented by counsel, and the case was put over until September 4. In the meantime the girl will remain in the convent. The application for her release is made on the ground that her parents are poor and very old and are entitled to the assistance of their child and the comfort of her society. It is charged that the nuns have exercised a moral restraint over her by representing to her that she will be forever damned if she violates the vows taken when she entered the society.—Cincinnati Enquirer, Aug. 25.
