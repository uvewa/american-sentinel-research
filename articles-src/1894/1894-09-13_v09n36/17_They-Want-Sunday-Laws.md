An open meeting of the National Barbers' Association was held last night at 49 West Diamond Street, Allegheny. There was a small attendance, but those who came were as earnestly exhorted to join the union as if their number had been larger. It was explained that this winter the bosses will try to have the Sunday law repealed, so far as the barbers are affected. The workmen want to fight this move and hope to be able to defeat it.—Pittsburg Times, Aug. 15, 1894.
