A TELEGRAM from Pittsburg, Pa., states that the Grand Army encampment is to be made the occasion for beginning an agitation, designed to be national in its extent, for the training in military science of all the schoolboys in the country. A special committee was appointed at a recent meeting of the advisory council of the patriotic orders in Allegheny County, which is planning to place the subject before the encampment. It is proposed to get a law passed by Congress binding the United States to furnish its military tactics and supply drill sergeants to all States that enact laws for their introduction into their schools. Teachers are to be required to learn the tactics. Petitions are to be generally circulated here during the encampment, addressed to Congress, and their circulation will be kept up afterward. There will be an endeavor made to have the Pennsylvania legislature pass favorable laws this winter. It is contended that the plan would give the United States the finest citizen soldiery in the world.
