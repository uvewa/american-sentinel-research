In his "Sunday Reform Leaflets" for September, Rev. Edward Thomson, LL. D., says of the Sunday movement:—

There is no compelling men to be religious or supporting State church, no Puritanical bigotry. The Jew, or Mohammedan, or pagan simply must not make a boisterous demonstration, such as the parade on Sunday. Why?—Because the vast majority of the people see fit to worship on that day. The Jew, or Mohammedan, or pagan must not keep open shop that day. Why?—Because the people have decreed a rest-day from labor once a week to help humanity, and that is the day.

And in order that people may not be disturbed, and in order that they may rest, everybody else must rest likewise! Even the Tennessee and Maryland farmers must not do any work, however quiet, or in however retired a place! And why? Let the courts of Tennessee answer,—Because it is "immoral and of pernicious effect." And this is the much vaunted "civil Sunday," the greatest fraud of the century.
