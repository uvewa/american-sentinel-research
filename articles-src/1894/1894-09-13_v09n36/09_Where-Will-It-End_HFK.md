As we look about us and see the result of the controversy between capital and labor, the question is suggested to our minds, Where will all this end? What will be the final result of this contention if it continues? If it be true, as it certainly is, that history repeats itself, can we not see where this will end, by noticing how similar agitations have ended?

We find a striking resemblance between the Roman republic and the American Republic. The Roman constitution "was popular in form beyond all constitutions of which there is any record in history." The fact of their being able to prosper under such a constitution was due to their power of self-control. "They were called a nation of kings, kings over their own appetites, passions, and inclinations. . . . They were free politically, because freedom meant to them, not freedom to do as they pleased, but freedom to do what was right."

Such were the Romans formerly, but as their conquests spread, "money poured in upon them in rolling streams of gold." With the money came luxury, and luxury was followed by vice. Thus we see a change coming over the morals of the Romans. They no longer did what was right, but that which would promote their own selfish interests. Vice and corruption preyed upon the very vitals of society. "The 'virtues' which they had been taught to reverence had no place among the graves of the new theology."§ The Romans, once masters of their evil tendencies and desires, were now mastered by them; and it was this loss of the power of self-control, in which lay the germ of decay of the Roman government. "Popular forms of government are possible only where individual men can govern their own lives on moral principles, and where duty is of more importance than pleasure, and justice than material expediency."

A republic is a government of the people, and is nothing more or less than the individuals who compose it, united into a body for the mutual benefit of all concerned. So above all other forms of government it is necessary that the character of those individuals remain uncorrupted. If one man has not the power of self-restraint to control himself as an individual, ten thousand such men would be equally as incapable of governing themselves as a body. So when Roman morality fell, their days of self-government were numbered.

"Money! the cry was still money!—money was the one thought from the highest senator to the poorest wretch who sold his vote in the Contita. For money judges gave unjust decrees and jurors gave corrupt verdicts." To obtain money justly or unjustly, legally or illegally, became the universal passion among all classes. Yet "with all his wealth there were but two things which the Roman noble could buy, political power and luxury. . . . The elections, once pure, became matters of annual bargain between himself and his supporters."

The financial condition of the rich and poor grew farther and farther apart. "The rich were happy in the possession of all they could desire. The multitude was kept quiet by the morsels of meat which were flung to it when it threatened to be troublesome."† But this method of preserving peace would not long answer the purpose. The poor were inspired by the spirit of envy and jealousy. Leaders like Tiberius and Caius Gracchus arose to relieve the distressed condition of the people, but, supposing the end to justify any means, resorted to civil strife and bloodshed. "It is easy to persuade the masses that the good things of this world are unjustly divided, especially when it happens to be the exact truth."§

As the "Roman constitution had grown out of the character of the Roman people;" when the character of the Roman people became so corrupt that they no longer had the power of self-control, their republican form of government was at an end.

Now, if the fall of Roman morality resulted in the fall of the Roman republic; and if like causes produce like results; what is to hinder the same result following the same condition of affairs existing in the United States today? Is human nature any different to-day from what it was in the days of the Roman republic? If it is not, can we not look for the same results to-day that we see in the history of Rome?

As it was in the days of Rome, so we see it to-day. To obtain money, and thereby indulge in luxury, is the ambition of all classes in our country. For money men will sell their hope of eternal life. Money is the channel through which corruption has crept and is creeping into our Government. The truthfulness of the words of Paul was never more perfectly demonstrated than it is to-day: "But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil." 1 Tim. 6:9, 10. The rich, not satisfied with what they have already gained, in many cases, by defrauding the laboring men, are combining to grind him lower and lower. While millionaires with their marble palaces are revelling in wealth and luxury, thousands of their fellow-beings are groveling in poverty, scarcely able to keep soul and body together. On the one hand, capitalists demand legislation to make them richer, while on the other, the workingmen "demand free rations first, and profitable work a little later." And who is to say which of these classes are most justly entitled to their claims?

Capital is combining against labor, and labor is combining against capital. The recent outbursts are but mutterings of the coming storm that will soon break upon our nation. How can it be otherwise, when corruption is permeating our nation through and through? "Courts of justice are corrupt. Rulers are actuated by desire for gain, and love of sensual pleasure. Jurors are perverted, bribed, deluded. . . . Drunkenness and revelry, passion, envy, dishonesty of every sort are represented among those who administer the laws. 'Justice standeth afar off; for truth is fallen in the street and equity cannot enter.'"*

Modern religionists, seeing the deplorable condition of society, are aware that, unless something is soon done, grievous results must follow. Sad it is that, while trying to correct the error, they do not profit by the experience of Rome, but undertake to bring about the desired end by uniting the Church with the State,—the very thing that led to the final overthrow of Rome. So instead of helping matters they make them worse. The cause of the present condition of things is the low grade of morality. Hence the only way to remedy it is to raise the moral standard. But while endeavoring to promote morality, they undermine their work by taking away the very foundation upon which true morality stands. "Many ministers are teaching their people, and many professors and teachers are instructing their students, that the law of God has been changed or abrogated. . . . Those who teach the people to lightly regard the commandments of God sow disobedience to reap disobedience. Let the restraint imposed by the divine law be wholly cast aside, and human laws would soon be disregarded. . . . Already the doctrine that men are released from obedience to God's requirements has weakened the force of moral obligation, and opened the floodgates of iniquity upon the world."†

And will the affairs of our country get any better? Will the individuals composing our nation turn from their downward course and help build up the Government? God's Word answers: "No!" "But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived." 2 Tim. 2:13. It being the case, that men will grow more corrupt, just as surely as the corruptions of the Roman people caused the fall of the Roman government; the corruptions of the American people will cause the fall of the American Republic.
