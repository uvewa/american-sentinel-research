A READER in Wisconsin sends a postal card containing the following, which we reproduce for the sake of others who may also have noted the error:—

In an article on "Papal Infallibility," on page 268, center column, issue of August 30, is a reference to Luke 29:25. Where will I find it? Tell in first issue after receiving this.

The error is of course one that should not have occurred, especially as the book of Luke has but twenty-four chapters; yet as the subject of the text is given, probably most who noticed it have been able to locate the scripture referred to either by their knowledge of the Bible or by the use of a concordance. Nevertheless for the convenience of those who, like our correspondent, have not been able to do so, we give the proper reference, namely, Luke 22:25.
