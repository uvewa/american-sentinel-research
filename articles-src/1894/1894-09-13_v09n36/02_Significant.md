The following statement of facts raise the query, Who are the antichrists?—

The lynching troubles in Colorado seem to be the work of an oath-bound league, in which officers of the State and Federal Government are implicated, as well as men who have hitherto been reckoned good citizens. This is part of the oath found on the person of a prominent resident of the State: "In the presence of Almighty God and these witnesses, whom I have this day chosen as my associates and companions, I, ——, do most solemnly and sincerely promise and swear that I will do my duty at any and all times, as may be planned and agreed upon by these, my sworn companions, in exercising just and needed punishment on anarchists and such other criminals and murderers and strikers in Cripple Creek, and their fellow-sympathizers, either in high or low positions, the executive of the State not excepted, as we shall deem guilty of crime against law-abiding citizens of the United States, where human lives have been wantonly sacrificed, real and personal property destroyed or stolen, and many happy homes broken up." The order constituted itself judge, jury, and executioner, proceeding against such "as we shall deem guilty of crime," and there was no appeal from their decisions.

These men override all law in the interests of law! They commit high crimes in the name of law and order! They bind themselves by an oath to do unlawful acts and at the same time dub themselves, "The best people of the State, the law-abiding element," etc. But for this course they have eminent example. Anarchy is in the very air and the only escape from it is in strict and conscientious adherence to the rule: "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
