CERTAIN writers assert that the early Church, through its councils, set the Sabbath aside and put the Sunday in its place. We have taken pains to gather the essential facts on this point, and herewith submit them to our readers. The nature of this department, "The Councils," is fairly set forth in the following:—

It is not till after the middle of the second century that we find the example of Jerusalem followed, and councils called to solve questions that threatened the unity and well-being of the Christian Church and community. The earliest councils, historically attested, are those convened in Asia Minor against the Montanists; though it is by no means unlikely that at a much earlier period the Christian Greeks gave scope, in ecclesiastical affairs, to their instinct for organization, for taking common action in regard to matters affecting the public good. Near the end of the second century again varying views as to the celebration of Easter led to councils in Palestine, at Rome, in Pontus, Gaul, Mesopotamia, and at Ephesus. These councils were all specially called to consider particular questions. But before the middle of the third century it seems that in Asia Minor, at least, the councils or synods had become a standing institution and met yearly. About the same time we find councils in the Latin Church of North Africa. Before the end of this century there were councils meeting regularly in almost every province in Christendom, from Spain and Gaul to Arabia and Mesopotamia, and by extension and further organization, there was soon formed a system of mutually correspondent synods that gave to the church the aspect of a federative republic.—Euripolypedia Britannica, Vol. VI, p. 453, 5th edition.

According to the popular belief, one would naturally expect to find much concerning Sunday in the records of these councils. We have made careful examination of their history previous to the middle of the fifth century, and give below every reference to Sunday or its observance. It will be seen that the "Easter" question is the prominent cause for the few references which are made. The period covered by these investigations includes the first two "Ecumenical," or general councils, and not less than eighty local and provincial ones. They cover the time to 429 A. D. There were no rules concerning Sunday as a Sabbath. The references to it are of an incidental character rather than of a systematic consideration. The Synod of Elvira, Spain, 305 or 306 A. D. Canon 21, decrees that if one be staying in a city, and shall be absent from church on three Sundays, he shall be deprived of the communion for a "little time." We have given the earliest date for this council, although there are strong reasons in favor of a later one, and the exact date is not known. History Church Council 3, Hefele, Vol. I., p. 145, Edinburgh, 1872.

The 11th Canon of the Council of Sardica (343-347 A. D.), makes reference to the above action, as follows:—

Remember that our fathers have already directed that a layman who is staying in a town, and does not appear at divine service (celebrated connection), for three Sundays, shall be excommunicated; and if this is ordered with regard to the laity, no bishop can be allowed to absent himself for a longer time from his church, or leave the people entrusted to him, except from necessity, or for some urgent business.

The penalty of "excommunication" was added to many other acts besides staying from service for three weeks. In the collection of canons attributed to the "Fourth Synod of Carthage," which collection was evidently compiled during the sixth century, we find the following decrees:—

24. Whoever leaves the church during the sermon of the priest shall be excommunicated.

88. He who neglects divine service on festivals, and goes instead to the theatre, shall be excommunicated.

In the fifth "Carthagenian Synod" (fifth century), Canon 5th declares:—

On Sundays and feast-days no plays may be performed.

It will thus be seen that the act of "excommunication" was not ordered because Sunday stood above the other festivals in sacredness, but rather that this was a common punishment. Indeed it is attached to an almost endless catalogue of acts and omissions.

At the Council of Nice, the first Ecumenical Council, 325 A. D., there was much discussion concerning the time of holding what is now called the Easter festival. In that discussion the Sunday is referred to several times as the time for the specific Easter celebration. But the reference throws no light upon the character of the Sunday, per se. The 20th Canon of the council is as follows:—

As some kned on the Lord's day, and on the days of Pentecost, the holy synod has decided that, for the observance of a general rule, all shall offer their prayers to God standing.

The Synod of Laodicea—343-381 A. D.—furnishes an oft-quoted decree, as follows:—

Christians shall not Judaize and be idle on Saturday, but shall work on that day; but the Lord's day they shall especially honor, and as being Christians, shall, if possible, do no work on that day. If, however, they are found Judaizing, they shall be cut shut from Christ.

The 16th Canon of the same council shows that this restriction could have applied to only a part of the Sabbath, for it shows that it was a day of public religious service like Sunday. It is as follows:—

On Saturday [Sabbath] the gospels and other portions of the Scriptures shall be read aloud.

Helefe says of Canon 16:—

Neander remarks that this canon is open to two interpretations. It may mean that on Saturday, as on Sunday, the Holy Scriptures shall be read aloud in the church, and therefore, solemn public service shall be held; and Canon 49, is in favor of this interpretation. It was also the custom in many provinces of the ancient church to observe Saturday as the feast of the creation.

Canon 49 reads as follows:—

During Lent, the bread shall not be offered, except on Saturday and Sunday.

Canon 51 says:—

During Lent no feast of the martyrs shall be celebrated, but the holy martyrs shall be commemorated on the Saturdays and Sundays of Lent.

To this canon Helefe adds:—

For the obvious reason that on these days there was full and solemn service.

The English translation of Helefe has incorrectly used Saturday for the "Sabbath," in the foregoing paragraphs.

The foregoing extracts constitute the testimony of the councils, local and general, down to the close of the first quarter of the fifth century. They show: (a) That little attention was paid to the Sunday question by the councils, aside from its relation to the contest relative to the time of observing Easter. (b) These extracts show that the Sunday had no preeminence in point of sacredness over the Sabbath, or over other festivals. Indeed, the order not to rest on the Sabbath indicates that the custom of abstaining from labor on that day still continued in force, and that cessation from labor on Sunday was not yet an established custom. These facts relative to what was said by the councils, show that after the time of Constantine the civil law was the stronghold of the Sunday. Its gradual elevation into the place of the Sabbath resulted from the seeds of paganism from which legislation began, and not from the religious experiences of the church.—The Evangel and Sabbath Outlook.
