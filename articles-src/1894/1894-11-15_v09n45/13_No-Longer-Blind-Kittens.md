THE Rev. Dr. John L. Scudder, pastor of the Tabernacle in Jersey City, talked of politics yesterday in a prelude to his sermon. He said:

"Almost every church in America has its Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor, and these societies, extending into every hamlet in the land, have declared their intention to enter politics. This is a significant fact when we remember that these organizations number several million followers and are composed of young people full of energy and enthusiasm. This means that the Church is going into politics and is going there to stay. Furthermore, it means that the Church is to become a powerful political factor, for in these societies it has a perfect and permanent organization extending through county, State, and nation, and will act as a unit on all great moral questions.

"I do not take it that the churches are to form a separate political party; on the contrary, they will stand outside all parties, but they will cooperate, and as one prodigious organization make their demands upon existing parties and have their wishes fulfilled. Before election every local union will assume temporarily the appearance of a political convention, ratifying such candidates only as will carry out the desires of the respectable portion of the community. They will secure written pledges from the candidates, and hold them to their pledges, and if they fail to keep their pledges those particular politicians will be doomed.

"I hail with the utmost joy the coming of this eventful day in the history of the Church. At last the politicians will find that we Christian people are not a parcel of fools; that we know enough to cooperate, command several million voters, and hurl our combined forces against the enemies of righteousness, law, and order. The reason the Liquor Dealers' Association is such a power in this country and obtains recognition from both the Republican and Democratic parties, is because it is a unit and acts as one man in political campaigns; because they place the liquor interests first and party second. Now, when Christian people combine and hold an overwhelming balance of power, when they pull together and refuse as a body to vote for any man who will not carry out their principles, then, and then only, will they be respected and become politically powerful. Why should there not be Christian halls as well as Tammany Hall? What objection to a sanctified caucus? Why not pull wires for the kingdom of God? If sinners stand together and protect their interests, why should not the saints do the same thing, and whip old Satan out?

"Another refreshing sign of the times is that the ministers are beginning to talk politics from the pulpit with a will. The day was when they thought it out of place and felt constrained to be silent. They were victims to those in the churches who wanted the 'simple gospel.' To-day they are applying the gospel to politics and everything else. They are determined to destroy as well as to regenerate. The popular clergyman of to-day is something more than an annex to the ladies' sewing society, a piece of holy bric-a-brac or ornament for an afternoon tea. In the evolution of the Church he is becoming a colonel of a regiment, ready at a minute's notice to lead his forces against the enemies of righteousness. His pulpit is being turned occasionally into a battery, from which he pours shot and shell into the ranks of the foe.

"Ministers are no longer good little kittens, with eyes unopened, mewing about apostolic succession and other trivialities; they are developing into formidable Parkhurstian cats, with backs high up in air, splitting vigorously at the political dogs that surround them and keeping them at bay with claws that cut. As a profession we have worn blinders long enough which allow us to look straight ahead, yea, even into eternity, but prevent our nothing what transpires about us. The modern dominic can make the saints comfortable as heretofore, but anon he can make the sinners squirm. He is prophet as well as preacher, and when he has something to say the newspapers put wings upon his messages and set them flying all over the land. God bless the press of America in their generous endeavors to help us in reforming our city governments."—New York Sun, Nov. 5, 1894.
