A CORRESPONDENT of the Examiner, from Philadelphia, whose facile pen, we think, betrays Dr. Wayland, late editor of the National Baptist, writes as follows about the "Philadelphia Ministerial Union":—

The atmosphere is orthodox and conservative. After the paper has been read and the eulogies pronounced up in it, Dr. Fernley (Methodist Episcopal), chairman of the standing committee on the Sabbath, makes his worsted report, dilating upon the unutterable atrocities which are committed upon that long-suffering day, and brings in a resolution requesting the mayor to execute the statute of 1794. This statute, perhaps, sums one member of the conference has read; the remainder have a vague idea it has something to do with keeping Sunday. In point of fact, if it were carried out, it would close every cigar shop (of which I should be glad), the sale of Sunday papers (in which I should heartily rejoice); it would also lay its hand upon every Sunday train, passenger or freight, of the Pennsylvania and Reading Railroad, and every other road in the State, and every street car in every town; but the ferocious United and Reformed Presbyterians and kindred bodies do not aim at so large game. They keep their eye out diligently until they see some worthy Seventh-day Baptist or Adventist, who has conscientiously and rigidly observed Saturday, plowing in his fields of a Sunday morning; and they bring the law to bear upon him with a promptness that almost takes away his breath, and he finds himself lodged in the county jail and fined. Thus they diligently follow the precedent set them in the Holy Scripture; they strain out the Sunday plowing, and, while they swallow the Pennsylvania railroad camel, which goes roaring through every city and hamlet in the State, loaded with Sunday passengers and freight and Sunday newspapers. They appoint a committee to wait upon the mayor, and to request him to do all these things. At the next meeting, it appears that the committee has not been notified, and has not discharged its duties; and so they begin all over again. Thus the Union has material for an unlimited series of meetings. And not the least part of the joke is that, by the time they got to this stage of the proceedings, a very large proportion of the attendants have dropped away; and the final vote, passed in the name of all the evangelical Christians of Philadelphia, has possibly a dozen hands raised in its favor.

The farce which is enacted annually and semi-occasionally, in such reports as that referred to above, when placed alongside of the actual facts, is seen to be doubly farcical. These Sunday law reformers know that they can do nothing with large game. They know, and loudly complain thereof, that the church members with whom they sit at the communion table, patronize Sunday newspapers and ride on Sunday trains, and so on to the end of the chapter. But since something must be done, they talk, and report, and resolve, and—and then lie in wait for some Sabbath-keeping farmer, or shoe-string selling Jew, who may be arrested and punished for violating the effete law of 1794, in Pennsylvania, or similar laws in Maryland or Tennessee; and this they call "Sabbath Reform." Such men may be honest as to purpose, but inconsistency and injustice can find few better exponents. Why does not this aged "Philadelphia Sabbath Association" set its church members right, or put pious embargo on the Pennsylvania railroad, or any one of the Sunday newspapers of that Sabbath-lovinacity? Why not go gunning for such game, and let honest Sabbath-keepers and industrious Jews alone? Few shams are greater than that, for one hundred years Pennsylvania has refused all rights of conscience to Sabbath-keepers, under its Sunday law of 1794. And even now these Sabbath Association people refuse to allow any modification of that illiberal law, lest newspapers and railroads take more liberties, if Seventh-day Baptists be granted their just rights; as if, forsooth, newspapers and railroads and saloons do not take all the liberties they choose because they are stronger than single individuals who may chance to be in the unpopular minority. Glaze it over as you will, such religious liberty is enough to stir the bones of William Penn, and stamp "shame" on the Christianity of these years.—The Evangel and Sabbath Outlook.
