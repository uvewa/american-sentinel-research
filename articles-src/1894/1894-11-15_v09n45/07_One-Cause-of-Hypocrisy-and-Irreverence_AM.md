RELIGION and the State cannot be united without injury to the reverence due to the Creator. Where the State interferes in behalf of the Church, enforcing her precepts, religion suffers, for there is mockery and irreverence. To the world it seems that the Church has more adherents when her precepts are enforced by the civil power, but in reality she has not. People who serve God only under compulsion are hypocrites. The true follower of Christ serves God from love to him, and not because he is compelled to. Like Paul, the love of God constrains him. He sees the love of God manifested toward him in the gift of his Son Jesus, and so he is constrained, not compelled, to serve his Maker. He sees the love of God manifested through his long-suffering, mercy and goodness toward him, and that love constrains him to love God in return. By beholding the love of God, he becomes changed into the image of God, and has charity toward all men, even as God has, compelling none to believe as he does, but through the love of God which is in him, he entreats his fellow-men to serve the God of love, the Father of light. He is long-suffering, merciful and good, even as God is, and suffers long with those who will not follow God as he does. He has no thought of calling upon any other power except God. He knows that man cannot be forced to serve God. Jesus is his example. He suffered long with those he came to save, neither did he compel them to serve him and follow his precepts. In tears he looked upon the city he loved, and his great heart of compassion swelled with emotion caused by the sorrow he felt toward that nation, and it found expression in the loving, tender words: "O, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not." There is no compulsion in these words; nothing but love and pity.

The Christian knows that the religion of Jesus Christ is spiritual, but that the State, the civil power, is carnal, and that they cannot agree together. That which is carnal does not, can not, understand the requirements of a just God. There is no justice in the carnal. God alone is just, and to all who serve him in sincerity and truth, he teaches justice. The State is carnal, worldly, the Church is spiritual, godly, and "doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?" Do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles? By their fruits they shall be known. All who serve God, who are the children of the Heavenly King, will follow the teaching of their Divine Master, and not resort to force.

Where there is a union of Church and State, the Church, so-called, is at enmity against God, for he despises the hypocrite. "Be not deceived; God is not mocked; whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap." The world to-day is filled with hypocrites. Worldly men put on their religious garb, the religious garb of the civil power, and under that serve Satan even better than they would without it. Take, for instance, the music halls of the large cities and seaside places. On Sunday they pretend to have "sacred concerts," and with that is attended every crime and evil that is carried on in such places. Is this hypocrisy? Is this mockery? Yet this is the religion enforced by the State. The civil power walks past these places perfectly satisfied. They understand not the requirements of God. This is as far as the carnal heart can understand the requirements of a just, pure, God.

Union of Church and State also encourages irreverence. Men of corrupt, selfish minds profess to serve God when in reality they are worse than the worst infidel. In England, the song, "God Save the Queen," which is, or is supposed to be, the prayer of the people, is sung in every worldly gathering, where the minds and desire of men are on selfish, worldly pleasure. Is this not irreverence toward God their Creator? Can it be believed for a moment by those who have the least conception of what a righteous God requires of his followers, that he hearkens to a prayer sung or said in such a way as this is sung? It is mockery, irreverence; yet this is the religion of the State. This is how the carnal State teaches the people to serve God. This is enforced religion. Men join the church in order to gain for themselves an office of the State. Yet the Church says this is all right. They cannot see that it is hypocrisy right through. The Congress of the United States hearkened to the voice of the Church in order to gain her favors, because of the threats she made; and so it is in everything where Church and State are joined. The whole thing is hypocrisy, mockery, irreverence.

How different is the true worship of God. By those who know God and know what he requires of them, and what is due to him, there is a deep devotion, a reverence, which is far different from that of those taught by the State or a worldly Church. "The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God, to the pulling down of strongholds." No other weapon can be successfully used to carry on the work of God in the earth. Force is Satan's method, and those who use it are using the weapon of Satan to carry on the work of God. Jesus said: "My kingdom is not of this world, else would my servants fight." God requires his servants to use his power alone to do his work. They are to stand by and see the hand of the Lord in their work. "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts."

We have an instance of this in the falling of the walls of Jericho. All that the people were to do was to obey the voice of the Lord, not use force, and so the work was accomplished by the power of God. He is able to take care of his own work without the aid of any carnal institution. When he comes, and the people who have forced his religion on men stand before him, saying, "IN THIS NAME we have done all these things," he will ask the question, "Who hath required this at your hands?"
