BALTIMORE, Nov. 4.—This is the feast-day of St. Charles Borromeo, and Cardinal Gibbons preached a sermon on Christian unity, based upon the career of that reformer.

He said that while it could not be denied that lamentable abuses crept into the church in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, a distinction should be made between the infallibility of the church and the personal responsibility of her teaching body.

It was to be regretted that Luther and Calvin and the other leaders of the Reformation had not followed the example of St. Charles by fighting iniquity within the church, instead of using their weapons against her.

If the municipal organization is badly administered, said the cardinal, the reformers do not abolish the mayoralty and city council; if there is corruption in the State Government, the reformers do not try to abolish the State Government; if there is maladministration in the General Government, they do not try to abolish the presidency, but rather to turn the rascals out. He added:

Thank God, there is a yearning desire for reunion. I myself have received several letters from influential Protestant ministers expressing the hope of a reunion and inquiring as to the probable basis of a reconciliation. The conditions of reunion are easier than are generally imagined. Of course there can be no compromise on faith or morals. The doctrine and moral code that Christ has left us must remain unchangeable. But the Church can modify her discipline to suit the circumstances of the case.

The cardinal concluded with a fervent prayer that the day may soon come when all who profess the name of Christ may have one Lord, one faith and one baptism, and be under one shepherd.—New York World, Nov. 5, 1894.
