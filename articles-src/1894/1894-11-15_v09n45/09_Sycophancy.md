THAT is a sweet little note which Viscount Halifax, in behalf of the English Church Union, has written to the cardinal archbishop of Toledo, benevolently informing him that he, the aforesaid viscount and the union of which he is president, "desire absolutely to disclaim any complicity" with the consecration of Senor Cabrera as bishop at Madrid by the archbishop of Dublin, and that this action has caused him and them "profound distress." He also wishes to say that he and they "deplore the course of those who have withdrawn themselves from the communion and authority of their lawful pastors." We can imagine the cardinal archbishop quizzically thanking the president of the church union and suggesting that they return to the communion and authority of the Chief Pastor of Christendom.—The Independent.
