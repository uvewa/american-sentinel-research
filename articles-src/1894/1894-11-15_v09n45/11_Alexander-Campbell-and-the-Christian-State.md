[In 1820 there was organized in West Middletown, Washington Co., Pa., a society, called the West Middletown Moral Society. The principal object of the society was to enforce the Pennsylvania Sunday law of 1794, which is still on the statute books of the State. This Moral Society was organized by the United Presbyterians, the same people who, later in 1863, organized the National Reform Association. Alexander Campbell, the founder of the Christian or Disciple Church, ably opposed the society in a series of articles published in the Reporter, of Washington, county seat of Washington County. His articles were signed "Caudidus." A United Presbyterian minister, by the name of Wylie, attempted to defend the society, and signed himself "Timothy." The discussion continued from April 17, 1820, the date of Mr. Campbell's first article, to February 22, 1822, during which time almost every phase of the compulsory Sunday law question was treated. As a result the Moral Society perished, not to appear again until 1863 when it was revived by the same denomination under the name, National Reform Association. Every word of Mr. Campbell's invincible logic and withering denomination is applicable to the association, remediated under the name, National Reform Association, and kindred organizations, such as the American Sabbath Union, the Pennsylvania Sabbath Association, etc.]

THERE are not a few, and perhaps Mr. T. amongst the number, who suppose the planting of a church or churches amongst, or the having the gospel preached to a people, bring them naturally into a Christian state. Hence, do we often hear of Christian nations; but that the unbelieving part of Pennsylvania is in any more Christian state than the people of Japan or China, Greece or Rome; or to be compelled to regard the institutions of Christianity any more than the inhabitants of the above States, I have yet to learn and I feel very certain that Mr. T. will never teach me to think so. I readily admit that the condemnation of the unchristian part of any community, whither the gospel has been carried, and where it has been published, will be more aggravated than that of those to whom it has never been proclaimed. And I fully admit the aphorism, that, "where there is much given there will be the more required." Yet I could not agree with an eminent preacher in Scotland, who taught that, that "land was married to the Lord," and that the first verse of the 87th Psalm, "O Lord, thou hast been favorable to thy beloved land," belonged exclusively nowadays to Old Scotland. No more can I believe that one thousand Christians amongst ten thousand who are not Christians, can change them into a Christian state any more than ten thousand infidels could convert one thousand Christians living amongst them, into the state of nature. And finally, that all unbelievers, however dressed off, in the borrowed garb of some meager virtues, from the reflex light of Christianity, are in heart heathens in the sight of God.

In respect of the establishment of a "Christian Sabbath" by Constantine, Mr. T. admits that it was not established until in his reign. But the reasons assigned, though specious, are not solid. It is insinuated in them, that it was the want of power, and the opposition made to Christians that prohibited them from having it enforced on all kinds of men. This is as much as to say that the primitive Christian had the disposition if he had had the means. This, if it be, as I am not certain that it is, the import of his remarks is contrary to the whole scope of primitive Christianity in the New Testament; for unconverted men were never commanded to perform any duty until they had believed or repented, consequently could not have been compelled by any primitive Christian to observe any Christian ordinance.

Mr. T. tells us that he is not for marrying Church and State, and says he thinks that laws compelling men to observe the Sabbath may be enacted by the State without such a marriage. Well, grant it, and then it is but the courtship, or it is an illicit commerce which subsists between the Church and the State. The forms of marriage are dispensed with by Mr. T., but the intercourse and events are the same. Like those women of whom we read, in that old-fashioned Book, who said to the man of their choice, "We will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel, only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach." Mr. T. would have the Church independent of the State, but only one or two small accommodations would be thankfully received and gratefully remembered.—Caudidus (Alexander Campbell), in Washington (Pa.) Reporter, April 21, 1821.
