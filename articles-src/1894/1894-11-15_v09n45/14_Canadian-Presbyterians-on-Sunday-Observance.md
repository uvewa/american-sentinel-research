TORONTO, Oct. 22.—A meeting for the furtherance of Sabbath observance was held to-day in the Central Presbyterian Church, under the auspices of the Toronto Presbytery. Papers and addresses dealing with the subject from various points of view were read and delivered by local ministers. This evening the feature of the meeting was an address by Mr. John Charlton, M. P., who took occasion to strongly denounce the treatment accorded by the Senate to his Sabbath observance bill, which, he said, had ignominiously kicked it out without pretending to consider its merits. The Rev. James Grant, speaking on the same subject, said the Senate should certainly be mended or ended, and it was time they set about doing it.—Montreal Witness, Oct. 21, 1894.
