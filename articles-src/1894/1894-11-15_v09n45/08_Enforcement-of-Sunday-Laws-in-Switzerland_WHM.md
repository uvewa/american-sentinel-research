BY W. H. MCKEE, BASEL, SWITZERLAND.

(Conclusion.)

Again, if Sunday were a purely secular day, Sunday work would not disturb. Honest labor does not disturb a man who is not influenced by religious prejudices. It cannot be the noise in our publishing house that disturbs the people. On the Schützenmatte in front of the building there is ten times as much noise. August 12, the day for which we were fined, there was in front of our house drilling of soldiers, playing football, beating of drums, and shooting,—a noise and din that could be heard a mile, while our working could scarcely be heard on the street by passers-by. The noise on the common was made by those learning the art of war,—the best way to kill their fellow-men; while our work was printing the gospel, for the salvation of men. Shall our work be punished and the other allowed on the same day and in the same place? This is but another illustration of the injustice brought in by Sunday laws. The injustice of our punishment will still further appear when we consider that the amount of work which we do is very little in comparison with what is done by the railways, tramways, shops, hotels, barbers, restaurants, saloons, etc. The saloons and restaurants are allowed to work for the stomach's sake, shall we not be allowed to work for conscience' sake? If the legislators have regard for the stomach, why not regard the conscience of people? Is the stomach more sacred than the conscience?

9. It is also argued that if we were allowed to choose our day of rest, others would do the same and thus all days of the week might be chosen. But there is not the least probability that such would be done; there is no history to warrant such a conclusion. In all the history of so-called Christian nations we find but two rest days,—Sabbath (Saturday) and Sunday; and there is no probability that any other day will ever be chosen as a rest day. As Sunday is the day generally observed by both religious and non-religious, it is by far the most convenient to observe this day with the majority, no one would be out of joint with the social and religious world and undergo all the inconvenience that this would subject him to without being led by strong religious convictions. France has a law securing the laborers a weekly rest day. The religious people wanted Sunday specified as the rest day; but the law-makers refused their request, knowing that fixing the day would interfere with individual rights and lead to religious persecution. Although the people in France are left free to choose their rest day, no confusion results.

Again, the Turks have Friday; yet in Turkey, Seventh-day Adventists work on Friday and keep Saturday, and other Christians keep Sunday. Shall Switzerland be less tolerant with its citizens than Turkey? The Turks would have the same right to require the observance of Friday as the Swiss have to compel the laying aside of work on Sunday.

In exercising our right to keep God's law we would not bring disorder into the State. If every citizen should keep the ten commandments, there would be the most perfect order, and the police would have nothing to do. Thus our religion does not make us enemies of the State, but its truest friends.

10. As Christians we represent the gospel of Jesus Christ. A chief feature of the gospel is individual liberty. Christ died for every man, for the express purpose of saving him; and although he paid the infinite price, he obliges no one to accept salvation, but leaves all perfectly free to choose. Men can be religious or irreligious, and God lets his son shine on all. To compel men in matters of religion is papal, antichristian; and we regard it as a part of our religious duty to be true representatives of the gospel on this point. Sunday laws do enforce upon us a religious day, and thus maintain the spirit of the papary; and to submit to such laws is the same to us as submitting to the principles of the papacy, instead of truly representing the gospel. Sunday laws interfere with the rights of conscience, and hence are against the gospel, as is evident from their enforcement on Seventh-day Adventists; this is also shown by the plain declarations of Sunday law maleta themselves, as the following proves: "But there are many who are impressible, such we desire to help, and as for the rest we consider ourselves as the public conscience."—Swiss Sunday Friend, p. 456.

11. It is also stated that Sunday laws cannot be religious because the State is without profession of religion. If that be so, why have we a State church, Goet Friday, Easter, Ascension Day, Prayer and Fast Day, Christmas, etc.? And why does the State discriminate between religious bodies? Why does it enforce the day religiously observed by one class of religionists and not those of another? And if the State is not influenced by religious prejudices, why does it make laws which tend to uphold the Sunday of one sect and suppress the Sabbath of another? To the Jews Christ is a false prophet, yet they are forced to observe his birthday.

12. The question before us is not an individual one; it concerns our publishing house in Basel, it concerns our thirteen churches in Basel, Bienne, Chaux-de-fonds, Neuchâtel, Lausanne, Geneva, Zurich, Schaffhausen, St. Gallen, etc.,—and it concerns our people and the friends of religious liberty in all the world. Our denomination rests on two pillars,—the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. To undertake to hinder their keeping the ten commandments would be the same as to undertake to annihilate the denomination.

This denomination, with thirty-six conferences in Europe, Africa, America, and Australia, has six publishing houses in different parts of the world, the one at Basel being the smallest,—still here is a capital investment of nearly half a million francs. These publishing houses sell annually over three million francs' worth of denominational literature, in twenty-five languages. They publish twenty-two journals and magazines. In consequence of keeping the commandments these people have attained a high reputation for industry and honesty. If some of their members in Basel are spoiled of their goods, and imprisoned because they keep the ten commandments, this fact will be published in all the world, and Switzerland's good name for liberty will suffer, and this land of the free will be placed in the catalogue with Russia.

From either a religious or civil standpoint, no government can justify itself in the eyes of the world for making laws that oppress, and lead to the persecution of people for keeping the ten commandments just as God gave them. It is in this sense that we oppose the Sunday law.

To summarize,—in consideration, therefore:

1. That, It is my religious duty to rest the seventh day and work the remaining six days of the week; and that by so doing I do not invade the natural rights of my fellow-citizens, and

2. That, To lay aside my secular work on Sunday is to accept a rival institution to God's Sabbath, and

3. That, As a weekly rest day is assured to all employés in our publishing house we meet the object of Article 14 of the factory law, and

4. That, The enforcement of Sunday laws on Seventh-day Adventists is a violation of Article 49 of the Federal Constitution, and

5. That, By refusing to lay aside our regular secular work on Sunday we do not resist God's order in civil government, and

6. That, The enforcement of Sunday laws on Seventh-day Adventists imposes an unjust tax of 16% per cent. on them for the freedom of conscience, and

7. That, Sunday laws are religious, and oppressive to all that do not accept Sunday, and

8. That, It is the duty of the State to protect the individual in his natural rights, and

9. That, There is no likelihood of civil confusion from more days than Saturday and Sunday being chosen as rest days, if all are left free to choose, and

10. That, We cannot truly represent the gospel while submitting to Sunday laws, and

11. That, The decision of the police court of Basel under consideration concerns not only myself, but directly all employed in our publishing house, and indirectly a whole denomination, and

12. That, To enforce Sunday laws would oppress, imprison, and banish an honest, temperate, industrious people, to the everlasting disgrace of free Switzerland,—

I appeal from the decision of the police court of Basel, rendered Aug. 16, 1894, requesting to be freed from the fines imposed and all legal expenses, and further, asking indemnity for 665 francs, the loss occasioned me by the seizure and sale of my goods to satisfy former fines for Sunday work.

Respectfully submitted.

HENRY P. HOLSER.

This appeal was denied, unanimously. It is not in the province of the Swiss Supreme Court to decide as to the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of a federal law, to which class the factory law belongs; such questions come solely within the jurisdiction of the Federal Council. The matter will be brought before the Federal Council at its next session for an interpretation of the law,—several members have already said that the case, and the questions brought up by the appeal, will be given consideration and attention if presented to that body.

In the meantime the Basel police are inquiring with persistency and regularity at the publishing house for Mr. Holser, who, besides his duties as manager of the house, has a large circuit of churches under his pastoral care, and is now on his regular rounds among them, having taken the opportunity to be present himself at the hearing of his case before the Supreme Court while on one of these pastoral trips. And now the question is

## WJLL SWITZERLAND IMPRISON ELDER HOLSER?

At the hearing of the appealed case of Elder Holser, of Basel, before the Federal Tribunal,—the Swiss court of last resort,—the appeal was denied, as before stated, and the penalty of fine and imprisonment, for Sunday labor in the publishing house under his charge, affixed by the Basel court, left in full force.

The factory law, under which Elder Holser was arrested and convicted, is a federal law, and it appears that the Federal Tribunal has no power to construe a federal law, or to decide upon its constitutionality or unconstitutionality. That rests alone with the body that made the law,—the Federal Council. Therefore the result which has been had was a foregone conclusion from the first, there being really no judicial body having authority to revise the decision of the Basel police court on the important questions involved in this case; and really nobody with authority to open the case at all after its decision by the police court, short of the Federal Council which made the law under which the action was brought. Then, however, a wrong which had been done, as in this case, could not be righted. The only thing possible now is for the Federal Council to interpret or repeal the defective law that no one else may suffer injustice from it. Clearly, therefore, in cases brought before it involving the constitutionality of federal laws,—not only those in reference to Sunday labor in factories, but all federal laws,—the police court is actually the court of last resort.

Nevertheless the matter was given some attention by the federal judges. The sympathies of several of the judges were evidently with the appellant. At least one plainly saw the injustice worked by the law and had it been possible would gladly have put himself on record on the side of justice. His voice was heard on the side of right, though he could do no more. There was a full bench and all, except the president of the court, expressed their opinions and views on the subject, briefly.

Judge Biassi, of Solothurn, to whom the case had been referred, presented the matter before the court, reading some extracts from the text of the appeal, and giving a synopsis of the remainder. He said that Elder Holser was not convicted because he was an Adventist, but because he had transgressed the Sunday law. A previous case, decided last summer, had made a precedent, and according to that case, the court must refuse to hear the appeal. The fact that there is a federal Sunday law shows that Sunday laws are permissible under the Swiss Constitution, and so not contrary to its provisions. A clause in the very Article 49, which Mr. Holser claimed the Sunday law violated, could be used to condemn him, for it was there declared that "religious belief could not free any one from the performance of civil duties." (This clause was quoted in the appeal, and it was there shown that the observance of a religious rest day was not a civil duty. But of that point the judge made no mention.) The judge then moved that the decision of the Basel police court be sustained.

Judge Cornaz, of Neuchâtel, said that it could not be denied that the Sunday clause of the factory law rested on a religious basis. He argued that the State itself did not rest on Sunday, for it had its military exercises,—more than that much Sunday labor was performed by restaurants, stores, railways, etc., and hunting on Sunday was practised in many cantons. In principle the Adventists were right, and were it possible to decide this case in their favor that would be his vote. In view of the fact that all work does not cease on Sunday, that so much work is done, and that they are an orderly people, and in reality meet the intent of the law, the Basel police ought to have known how to have shut one eye in their case. He approved of the factory law in France which left the rest day optional. But as it was not in the province of this court to remedy the case, the only recourse being to the Federal Council, he sustained the motion to reject the appeal.

Judge Bezzola, of Granbuenden, could not agree with Judge Cornaz that Sunday rest stood on a religious basis; its foundation was politico-social, its object being to secure the workingman a regt day.

The factory law designates Sunday, because, as everybody rests on that day, it is better for the workingman that he should rest at the same time with all the others. We now have Sunday laws everywhere, and Sabbatarians must, "in God's name," accommodate themselves to the European social custom of resting on Sunday,—according to the old saying,—

"Schick dich in die Welt hinein;
Dean dein Kopf ist viel zu klein
Dass die Welt sich schickt hinein."

(This triplet might be rendered thus:—
"Fit yourself into the world, for your head is much too small for the world to fit into it.")

In concluding he called attention to the fact that Sunday hunting was already forbidden in several cantons, and said there would yet be a federal law on the subject.

Judge Clausen, of Canton Wallis, replied to the characterization of Article 14 of the factory law as religious, by Judge Cornaz, saying that when the factory law was enacted, both religious and politico-social factors were united, and he thought they could still continue to be united;—that when the present state of the confederacy was considered it must be admitted that the church still had something to say. It was not here as in some parts of France; yet even there they had to bow to the demands of Sunday.

Judge Stamm, of Schaffhausen, said that his reason for supporting the motion to reject the appeal was, that the Federal Tribunal could only follow unconditionally, the letter of the federal laws, and it was not within its jurisdiction, however desirable it might be, to consider whether a law is constitutional or not, and the court has nothing to do with the question of the violation of Article 49 of the Constitution; it is sufficient for it to know that Article 14 of the factory law has been violated.

Judge Morel, of St. Gallen, declared that it had never occurred to any one to introduce a Sunday of the English or Puritan pattern into Switzerland, there was therefore no law, or practice, to show that there should be no Sunday work at all, but that the custom prevailed that, as far as possible, there should be a common rest day. That which was of importance in this case, however, was that the appellant had violated the factory law, and in so doing had also violated the Sunday law of Baselstadt, which was quite strict. He considered the sentence of the Basel court constitutional, and upheld its decision.

Judge Blaesi stated, in addition, that he would have dismissed the case from consideration entirely for the reasons suggested by Judge Stamm, but he considered "the case one that should be more deeply probed, as it concerned important questions of freedom of conscience, which were set forth in a pamphlet, recently circulated in large numbers in all parts of the land."

From the thoughts and views offered by the judges, in the main, it can be seen that instead of probing the subject deeply the attention given it was so superficial as rather to deserve the name of scarifying than probing. It cannot be doubted, however, that when presented to the Federal Council, the question will really be opened and its principles discussed.

The court rejected the appeal without a dissenting voice.

At this time Elder Holser was making a circuit of the churches under his charge. When his appointments had been met, he returned to his office in the publishing house, at Basel, and to his regular duties there. He was there unmolested for five days, preaching on the Sabbath, according to his usual custom, and going about the city in the pursuance of his ordinary duties. On the morning of the sixth day a notice was sent him from the police department requiring him to present himself at police headquarters,—there being a clause in the order which stated that if voluntary compliance was not rendered, the order would be enforced. To this order Elder Holser replied in these words:—

To the Police Department, Basel:

Your order to present myself, October 23, 9 A. M., to begin three weeks' imprisonment, is at hand. In response I can only say that I am engaged in the service of the Lord and cannot leave his work without his order. This imprisonment is prescribed in consequence of my keeping the commandments of God as he has given them in his word; in doing this I have wronged no one, and have done nothing worthy of imprisonment. Were it for having committed an unjust act, I would present myself on an order to do so; but I cannot lay down the work of the Lord at the command of men for the misdemeanor? of having kept the ten commandments.

Respectfully,
HENRY P. HOLSER.

During the day the public collector called to collect the fine, but he was told very plainly and simply that a fine for keeping the commandments of God could not be paid.

And now comes the answer to the question before written, in the sub-heading: "Will Switzerland Imprison Elder Holser?" Just as I write this closing paragraph, Elder Holser comes to be door in the charge of two officers, for a parting word and shake of the hand before he goes behind the bars of the city prison of Basel.

No amount of superficial leniency in the way of non-interference while his case went to the Court of Appeals and to the Federal Tribunal, nor any degree of personal consideration shown him in the manner of his arrest, can be pleaded in extenuation. The fact remains which cannot be explained away;—Switzerland has imprisoned Elder Holser for keeping the commandments of God!

Basel, October 23.
