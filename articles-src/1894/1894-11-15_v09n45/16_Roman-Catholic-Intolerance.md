LORD PLUNKETT, the Protestant archbishop of Dublin, has put his long-threatened purpose into execution, and Madrid now possesses a brand new prelate to impart to the benighted citizens the blessings of the Reformation. The consecration ceremony appears to have been very quietly arranged, for the general public appear to have been amazed at the news the next morning. Senor Cabrera, the "bishop-elect," is a Spanish apostate who took to tract distributing (for a "consideration!") on his conversion to the "pure gospel." Already Cardinal Monescillo, archbishop of Toledo and primate of Spain, has published a pastoral letter protesting against the consecration of Cabrera and of a Protestant church in the city of Madrid. The archbishop's example will be followed by the other Spanish bishops, and the subject will be warmly discussed in both houses of Parliament. It will also be raised at the congress to be held this month at Tarragona, at which the papal nuncio, nearly all the Spanish prelates, and over five hundred notable laymen will be present.—Catholic Times, Philadelphia, Oct. 13.
