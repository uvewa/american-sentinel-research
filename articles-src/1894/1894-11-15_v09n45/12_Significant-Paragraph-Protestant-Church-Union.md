THERE who are anxious to bring about a union of various denominations with the Protestant Episcopal Church have suggested that the latter might, through its bishops, give coordination to non-Episcopal ministers. An Episcopal minister in Ireland, who favors the union of various Protestant churches there, has a little different suggestion to make. His proposition is, that a number of Presbyterian and Methodist ministers shall be selected and solemnly consecrated as bishops; then these bishops and the bishops of the Church of Ireland shall, together with a council of the clergy and laity of the Episcopal, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches, proceed to draw up a constitution of the United Church. In the course of a few years, under such a scheme, all the ministers of the United Church would be under valid orders. If we must have union at the price of the surrender of the validity of Congregational, Presbyterian, and Methodist orders, this scheme may be as good as any other.—The Independent, Nov. 1, 1894.
