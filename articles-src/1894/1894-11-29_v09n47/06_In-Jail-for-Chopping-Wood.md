### In Jail for Chopping Wood.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 16.—An interesting feature of the Seventh-day Adventists in convention here was a recital in the report of Secretary S. B. Horton, which was read to-day, of the persecution to which the denomination is subject in certain localities. It was reported that two members are in jail at Centreville, Md., for chopping wood on Sunday.

In some places it has been impossible to induce insurance companies to insure churches on account of the threats of incendiarism, and the secretary said that he had often been served with "whitecap" notices when trying to conduct meetings.—The World, Nov. 17.
