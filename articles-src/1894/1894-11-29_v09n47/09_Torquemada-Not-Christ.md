## Torquemada Not Christ.

The Christian(?) spirit that actuates the Sunday-law party is illustrated by the following period occurring in the columns of one of its foremost organs: "John Joy, convicted, in San Francisco, for robbing a man of five dollars, was sentenced, under the habitual criminal act, to life imprisonment. What short work a law like this would make of the Sunday paper in Pennsylvania." The contemplation of a law imposing the penalty of life imprisonment for Sunday work causes these misguided zealots to smack their lips with desire. Is this the spirit of Christ or of Torquemada? Such sentiments, expressed in these days, cause good men to shudder.—Advent Review and Sabbath Herald (Mich.), Nov. 12.
