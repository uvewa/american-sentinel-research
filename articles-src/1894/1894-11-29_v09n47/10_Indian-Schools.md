Here is richness expressed from the Western Watchman (Roman Catholic):—

The Bureau of Indian Affairs is maturing a scheme to establish public schools in all the reservations and to abolish the contract schools. This would be the death of many flourishing Indian schools, and would be a long step backward in the way of civilizing the Indians. Indians do not want a knowledge of the three R's. They do not need to read, because they have no books and no newspapers. They do not need to write, because they never leave each other far enough and long enough for correspondence. They do not need to cipher, because they have no accounts to keep that they cannot carry on their ten fingers. But they do need religion, and they will study to read and write in order to acquire a knowledge of the faith. Indian schools are a farce unless they are religious schools.

Are we to understand that this is the theory of instruction in the Catholic contract schools, which, it tells us, will be abolished by a public school system? No reading, no writing needed; no ciphering, nothing but religion? That is worse than we imagined. We hope it is one of Father Phelan's editorial jokes.—The Independent, Nov. 1, 1894.
