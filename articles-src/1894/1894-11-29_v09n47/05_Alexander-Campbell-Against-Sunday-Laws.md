## Alexander Campbell Against Sunday Laws.

[In 1820 there was organized in West Middletown, Washington Co., Pa., a society, called the West Middletown Moral Society. The principal object of the society was to enforce the Pennsylvania Sunday law of 1794, which is still on the statute books of the State. This Moral Society was organized by the United Presbyterian, the same people who, later in 1863, organized the National Reform Association. Alexander Campbell, the founder of the Christian or Disciple Church, ably opposed the society in a series of articles published in the Reporter, of Washington, county seat of Washington County. His articles were signed "Candidus." A United Presbyterian minister, by the name of Wylie, attempted to defend the society, and signed himself "Timothy." The discussion continued from April 17, 1820, the date of Mr. Campbell's first article, to February 22, 1822, during which time almost every phase of the compulsory Sunday law question was treated. As a result the Moral Society perished, not to appear again until 1863 when it was revived by the same denomination under the name, National Reform Association. Every word of Mr. Campbell's invincible logic and withering denunciation is applicable to the association, resuscitated under the name, National Reform Association, and kindred organizations, such as the American Sabbath Union, the Pennsylvania Sabbath Association, etc.]

WITHOUT introduction or apology, I proceed to examine Mr. Timothy's remarks upon my fifth objection to Judge Rush's address. The objection, as quoted by Mr. T., is as follows, viz.: "While the law prohibits many from industry allowable on other days, it allows them to spend the day reading newspapers, writing letters of business or amusement, talking politics, or speculating upon any carnal or temporal topic." Mr. T. commences his observation on the above objection, in the following words, which he amplifies by illustration, viz.:

It was before intimated that there are many degrees of the same crime, and that it would be absolutely impossible to make laws which would reach all crimes in all their degrees.

### He adds:

The crime of Sabbath-breaking in all its branches and degrees cannot be punished by human laws.

This he illustrates by the laws concerning murder. In the above, as indeed in all his previous remarks, the main question is begged, which ought to have been proven, viz.: That men have a right to make laws concerning the institutes of religion. A second mistake in the above is, that he places the laws respecting murder . . . and the laws respecting religion and divine worship under the same head. But a third and more glaring aberration from propriety in the above, is the principle he has assumed, to oppose my fifth objection, viz.: That there are certain degrees of the crime of Sabbath-breaking to be punished by civil law, and some degrees which are not, because he presumes they can not. Think not, sir, that I am forcing a meaning on his words which is not in them; for he endeavors to make me appear ridiculous for not admitting the above principle, in the following retort: "Because the law can not prohibit Sabbath-breaking in every degree, therefore it should not prohibit it in any!"

The civil law has made three degrees of murder; how many, then, has it made of Sabbath-breaking? Mr. T. has left us in the dark as to this, which he ought not to have done, seeing he is the author of this new theory. But he has been forced into this new theory, in order to oppose my fifth objection. He was obliged to place, talking politics, writing letters of business, carnal conversation, under the second, or for anything I know, under the sixth degree of the crime of Sabbath-breaking. One thing we learn, however, that driving a wagon is to be placed under the first degree of this crime, for it comes under those degrees which the civil "law can reach."

'Tis true he has said something below, which, perhaps, he designed should help us out, viz.: That 'overt acts,' 'acts susceptible of proof,' in ordinary cases are to be 'punished by law.' But unfortunately, this makes the theory worse, for then, either talking politics, carnal conversation, etc., are not overt acts of Sabbath-breaking; they are not susceptible of proof in ordinary cases, or they should, on his own new principle, be punished by civil law. O error, into what perplexing mazes, into what winding labyrinths, into what self-contradiction, dost thou lead thy silly captives, thy forlorn votaries!! But, perhaps, I have gone too far; let us take another look at it. Overt acts include every act that is not purely mental. To speak a mischievous word, to do a mischievous action, are equally overt acts and equally cognizable by civil laws in certain circumstances. Defamation, slander, and lying, are overt acts, and susceptible of proof in many instances, in 'ordinary occasions,' but not more so, than talking politics, or carnal conversation of any kind, in 'ordinary cases.' So then, view this new theory as we may, it helps its inventor nothing, for in spite of all efforts, it defeats his plan, and subjects the law to my fifth objection.

Again, it is a most pernicious theory to morals on Mr. T.'s own principle. For in placing all other acts of Sabbath profanation in 'some degree' inferior to those fined by the law of '94, it tacitly, yea, it manifestly, holds forth the idea, it teaches that talking politics, reading newspapers, writing letters of business, etc., are subordinate degrees of this crime, and are not 'overt acts' of Sabbath profanation. Is this the result of the principle with which T. assumes to refute me? Yes, inevitably it is. It obliges him to draw distinctions at the utmost variance with the Bible, and with right reason, to make those sins committed by the tongue less overt acts of crime than those committed by the hands or feet.

Now I cheerfully admit that civil laws can not reach the thought, and who says that they can? But I say that if civil law is to take cognizance of the transgression of the fourth commandment, it must, it should, take cognizance of all violations of it in word or deed; and that talking on anything carnal, or by speaking our own words, the commandment is transgressed equally as overtly, as actually, as in doing our own deeds. Upon the whole, then, I conclude that Mr. T.'s efforts to exclude the force of my fifth objection, neither does honor to him as a moralist, a teacher, or a divine.

I proceed to notice one of those ebullitions of genius and wit which Timothy next exhibits, which would do honor to a punster or an epilogue or prologue writer of Drury-lane, or to some of the Don Quixotes of the last century. When he had failed in his own conscience, in refuting anything that I had said, he bethought himself of making a Candidus of his own, which he constructs upon such a scale, as he thought he could not fail to knock down; and when he has done, when he has got his foot upon his neck, he cries out, O, do you see what a hero I am? Only look what I have done! I allude to the passage in which he exclaims, "Ye Rushes, ye Lockes, ye Grotiuses, hide, hide your diminished heads." Demolish your prisons, your penitentiaries as worse than so many Bastiles. Away with statute books, courts of justice, judges, and legislators! This is eloquence. This is rhetoric. O ye Demosthenes, ye Ciceroes, ye ancients, ye modern orators, hide, hide your diminished heads! because the real Candidus advocated the office of the civil magistrate, because he maintains that in all things . . . civil, affecting the life, liberty, reputation, and property, of the members of the community, laws should exist, and be justly administered. It would not suit to impeach him as an advocate for anarchy; therefore the genius of T. raises a new Candidus, one that just suits his purpose, one that is an enemy to all coercion in enforcing the civil and relative duties of citizen to citizen; one that would coerce men to all the acts of devotion!! To offer any other remark on this truly astonishing paragraph, would be an insult on every reader that can understand the import of one proposition, that knows that all true religion commences in, and proceeds from, the heart.

O ye Pauls, and ye Peters, and ye Johns, who taught your followers to instruct opposers of your holy religion in meekness; to walk wisely toward them that are without; to let your light shine before men, for their conviction and reformation; how sadly were you mistaken. Had you been under the tuition of this eminent moralist, had you studied in his college, you would have known better, you would have seen that fines, imprisonments, and penal statutes, were the true means of conviction and reformation in things religious!—Candidus (Alexander Campbell), in Washington (Pa.) Reporter, April 30, 1821.
