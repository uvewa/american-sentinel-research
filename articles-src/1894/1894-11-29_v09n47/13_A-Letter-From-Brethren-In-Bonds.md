## A Letter From Brethren In Bonds.

"Centreville Jail, Centreville, Md.,
"November 11th, 1894.

"To the Editor of the Sentinel—Dear Sir: It isn't news to-day to readers of the Sentinel that in Maryland Christians (?) are persecuting Sabbath-keepers because in keeping the law of God they break the civil law, which to-day is honored above God's law. The vast majority seem determined that the first day of the week shall be observed as a Sabbath, notwithstanding the divine command requires men to remember and honor the seventh day because God honored it by resting on that day 'from all his works which he created and made.'

"There are two of us in this jail for working on the first day of the week—W. J. Curlett and myself. There are two convictions against my companion, and three against me.

"I was arrested two different times. The first time I was charged with hoeing in my garden. The second time I was arrested on two charges, both of chopping wood on my wood-pile. On one of the Sundays when I worked, and for which work I was imprisoned, there was a person just a little way from my house, who was doing the same work that I was doing. I have cut wood in the town where I live, half of Sunday many a time, and without protest, before I began to keep God's commandments.

"The jailer and his family are very kind and generous to us; and we feel to praise God for his promise never to leave nor forsake us, because we know it is true.

"I pray that God may help us to be faithful.

R. R. WHALEY."
