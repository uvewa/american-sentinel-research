The appeal of the pope to all believers in Christ outside the church to come back into the unity of the one fold, is not to be a cry in the night of schism and heresy, followed by no action. Already a conference of Eastern Patriarchs is in session in Rome devising means to facilitate the return, to communion with the apostolic see, of the churches in the Orient and a movement has begun to make easy the homecoming of a number of clergymen in England belonging to the Anglican Establishment. Even in this country the good leaven is at work. Referring to it, the cardinal archbishop of Baltimore declared in his Sunday sermon that he would lay down his life gladly to bring about the reunion of Christendom. Concessions in discipline, he said, could be made, and every obstacle in the way of a return to the faith of our fathers, that could be taken away, should be moved. Surely there would be joy in Heaven if all Christians would put aside their differences in doctrine and realize the prayer of Christ that his disciples should be one, even as he and the Father were one!—Catholic Review, Nov. 17.
