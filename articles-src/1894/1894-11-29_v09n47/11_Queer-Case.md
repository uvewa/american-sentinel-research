THE St. Paul Dispatch speaks of a "Queer Case" in which a Seventh-day Adventist justice of the peace fined a man for misbehavior, but allowed him time to raise the money. He presented it on the Sabbath; but the justice could not conscientiously receive it, and now the culprit refuses to tender it again. The question is whether he can be compelled to do so, or whether the officer was justified in refusing it when proffered. In our opinion he would have been justified in keeping out of the office.—Advent Review and Sabbath Herald.
