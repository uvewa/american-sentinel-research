## Sunday Enforcement.

The International Sunday Observance League, though only incorporated eight months ago, is making rapid strides toward giving us a peaceful Sabbath. Its object is to promote a more general and thorough observance of the law of God, as laid down in the fourth commandment; to the end that the desecration of the Christian Sabbath day, by unnecessary labor and amusements, may be suppressed; that man may rest and be refreshed in body, mind, and soul; to maintain good morals and the peace and good order of society, and with this end in view, to establish State, provincial, and local organizations, whose object and purpose shall be to cooperate in the enactment and enforcement of laws for the suppression of all violations of the Sabbath day and to promote the highest and truest patriotism. The work of the league is intended to embrace all objects pertaining to good government, including among other things the election of persons of good moral character to public office. The league has adopted a constitution, so framed that all persons, irrespective of creed, desirous of promoting an improvement in public morality, may become members, including men or women, boys and girls, old and young. The league has commenced by injunction, the prosecution of the Chicago League Baseball Club and other kindred clubs, to restrain them from playing Sunday games, and purposes to carry the case to a successful termination. It is also engaged upon other plans of reform which cannot yet be made public because not fully matured. The membership is constantly increasing, and it is the desire that this fall it may reach 50,000.—Interior, Chicago, Nov. 1.
