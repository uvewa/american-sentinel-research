## Grants of Public Money for Parochial Schools.

A CAMPAIGN is being waged at the doors of Congress against those items in the Indian Appropriation bill providing for the support of parochial schools. The opponents of the appropriations for schools under church management claim that they have a large number of members of the House pledged to fight the grants when the bill is brought up. They represent that during the past eight years a total of $2,566,416 has been given to the Roman Catholic schools out of $3,767,951 appropriated, and that the proportion given to the Catholic schools is steadily increasing since the Congregational, Methodist, Presbyterian, and Episcopal churches have withdrawn their applications for funds.

The whole amount asked for this year is said to be nearly $400,000, to be distributed among forty-five Roman Catholic schools. The particular items in the bill which congressmen are asked to oppose are for the following schools: St. Boniface, Banning, Cal., $12,500; Holy Family, Blackfeet, Mont., $12,500; St. John's, Collegeville, Minn., $10,000; St. Benedict's, Stearns County, $10,000; St. Paul's, Clontarf, Minn., $10,000; St. Ignatius, Jocko, Cal., $45,000; St. Joseph's, Renssalaer, Ind., $8,330; Kate Drexel, Umatilla, Ore., $9,000.
