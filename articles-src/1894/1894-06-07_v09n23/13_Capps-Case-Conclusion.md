We print this week the conclusion of the brief of W. L. Carter, of counsel for the defense in the Capps case before the Tennessee Supreme Court. It is an able, candid, and temperate presentation of the law and precedents in such cases; and is withal convincing; nevertheless it failed to so impress the court, and the decision of the lower court has been affirmed. This commits Tennessee fully to a course of religious persecution under the forms of law, but without any statute authorizing anything of the kind. Sabbath-keepers in that State may as well be prepared for the worst. The courts stand ready to do the bidding of religious prejudice, bigotry and intolerance.
