An Oshkosh, Wis., paper says, "The Sunday Observance Society has by no means gone to sleep. Another public meeting of the society will be held on Wednesday evening at the First Methodist Church, the other evangelical churches having adjourned their regular prayer-meetings for that purpose. Several speakers and interesting music have been secured for that occasion."

And yet we are told the Sunday is a civil institution and that Sunday laws are in no wise religious. But the churches adjourn their prayer meetings to secure their enforcement. Do they do this for any other "civil" law?
