The attempt has been renewed to induce the present Congress to take action on the proposed amendment recognizing the name of God in the Constitution. We have never been much impressed by the arguments of those who urge this amendment. Considering the enormous difficulty of passing an amendment to the Constitution, and the slight gain that would accrue from the mere mention of God in that document, this agitation seems to us like hunting snipe with a howitzer. The same amount of effort and ammunition rightly expended would carry havoc into the ranks of the enemy. The putting of the name of God into the Constitution will make the United States neither more nor less a Christian nation than it now is; and if it were really a Christian nation, what would the presence or the absence of the name import?—N. Y. Examiner.
