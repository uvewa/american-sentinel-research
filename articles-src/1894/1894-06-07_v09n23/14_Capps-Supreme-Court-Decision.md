REFERRING to the Capps case the Jackson Daily Whig says:—

The supreme court, Judge McAlister delivering the opinion of the court, yesterday morning affirmed the case of W. B. Capps vs. the State, a case appealed from Weakley County.

Capps is a Seventh-day Adventist, and believes that Saturday is the Sabbath of the Bible, and that there is no divine warrant for changing the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday. He acted upon his conviction and kept Saturday as his Sabbath and true day of rest. On Sunday he went forth to his work, plowing, cutting stalks, etc. This shocked the sensibilities of his neighbors whose attention was attracted by the unusual spectacle. Capps was indicted in the circuit court of Weakley County, and there being no dispute as to facts, he was convicted, and Judge Swiggart fined him $10. The defendant claimed, of course, that he had committed no offense, and that his arrest and fine were illegal and unconstitutional and violative of that religious liberty guaranteed to all citizens of the United States by the Constitution thereof.

Judge McAlister said that the settled law of this State was against the defendant, and referred especially to the recent case of King vs. the State. The judgment of the lower court was affirmed.

The sentence of the court may seem light, but it is sufficient to keep Mr. Capps in jail for not less than sixty days. The fine alone, at twenty-five cents per day, the credit allowed by the State, is equivalent to forty days in jail, while the costs will make it considerably more.
