Nos. 119 and 121 of the Bible Students' Library have reached our table. These are both good numbers.

No. 119, "The Kingdom of Christ," contains 16 pages, and shows in an interesting way the nature of the kingdom and its subjects, and when and how it will be established—not when as to definite time, but in its relation to other events. Price, 2 cents.

No. 121, "The Temporal Millennium," is a 24 page tract. It should be in the hands of every lover of Bible truth for on few points do the people need instruction more than on this one. The doctrine of a temporal millennium is a soul-destroying delusion, and this tract is well calculated to make this fact clear to the reader. Price, 3 cents.
