The Theocrat, of Johnstown, Pa., publishes this series of resolutions passed by the Pittsburg Conference of the Evangelical Association, which met at Hyndman, Pa., March 15-19:—

WHEREAS, We believe the observance of the first day of the week as a day of rest to be of divine origin, and necessary for our physical, moral, and spiritual welfare as well as for the moral and religious elevation of the State and nation;

ASN WHEREAS, There is a growing tendency on the part of the opposers of the sanctity of the holy Sabbath, to persist in the desecration of this holy day, and who seem to have for their object the absolute overthrow of the sanctity and religious purpose of this divinely instituted day:

ASN WHEREAS, These enemies are endeavoring from time to time to secure the repeal of certain laws, securing to the religious element of this our fair land the sanctity of this best of days, and on the other hand to secure the enactment of such laws as tend to the demoralization of the divine purposes of the day:

Therefore Resolved, That we are opposed to the repeal of our present Sabbath laws, and that we, as a conference, pledge our united support to every measure and enactment tending toward the maintenance and perpetuity of this first day of the week as a day of rest and worship.

Resolved, That we are unalterably opposed to the issuing and sale of the Sunday newspaper, to railway and street car line traffic, and excursions, and all amusements of every kind at pleasure resorts, on this holy day.

Resolved, That we discourage general visiting, and admonish our people to the faithful attendance upon the religious worship of God's house, and to a quiet restful life in Jesus Christ.

It is noticeable that these expressions grow more and more positive in their character, and the discriminative statement of the "first day of the week" more and more assured. How suggestive a thing it is that so invariably the "Whereas we believe in the observance of the first day of the week" requires the "Resolved therefore, that we are in favor of legal measures to compel all others to do the same also,"—while the belief in and practice of the observance of the commandment "the seventh day is the Sabbath," results in the resolution that no man can be constrained to any religious observance but by the love of God.
