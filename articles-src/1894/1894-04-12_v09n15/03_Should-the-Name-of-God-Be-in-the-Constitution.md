No.

Men should only act in the name of God by virtue of a direct commission from him to so act. To act in his name without such commission, is equivalent to forgery; for a commission purporting to come from heaven which in fact has originated on earth and among men, is the use of the name of God to render valid acts in his name which it is conceded would otherwise be invalid, and this is forgery.

The Constitution is the instrument by virtue of which the acts of our political legislators, jurists and executors, are relieved of the element of usurpation, and placed in harmony with the rights of all men. By this Constitution the authority of these officials depends primarily upon the votes of the people, upon men. So long as this view, the view of our fathers, obtains, there is no danger of the union of Church and State. But if the name of God is placed in the Constitution, thus logically authorizing Government officials to act in the name of the Lord, there is no inconsistency in uniting Church and State; but on the contrary there would be a great inconsistency in not uniting them.

Intelligent beings are supposed to act with reference to clearly defined thoughts. They are supposed to move in paths whose direction, character, and destination they know something about. Inserting the name of God in the Constitution should not be an exception to this rule. It should be done if done at all with reference to what he is, what he requires, what consequences will follow observing or violating those requirements. There are many gods whose names are mentioned in the world's religions. Which one of these shall be placed in our Constitution? We imagine that we hear a chorus of voices answering, "The Christian's God, because this is a Christian nation." If people are to be Christianized by pretending to observe Christianity, a respectable minority of this nation is Christian; if they are only Christianized by observing Christ's teachings, not even that much can be said. This anxiety to have the name of what is vaguely termed the Christian's God inserted in the Constitution, and the Christian's text-book used in public schools, is itself an exhibition of a great lack of practical Christianity; for while pretending to welcome to our shores all nations and religions, we are intent upon selfishly gaining an advantage over them by having our religion taught in our schools, and the name of our God inserted in the Constitution. The zeal that leads in either of these directions is the same in character and could easily become the same in extent, as that which proselyted by fire, sword, rack and thumb-screw. It proposes, that if it cannot advance its interests fast enough by the opportunities which all enjoy equally, that it will accomplish its work by getting an advantage of its competitors, by securing a sort of religious monopoly, the most contemptible of all the monopolies that have been born of human selfishness and greed.

In deciding as to what God shall have his name inserted in the Constitution, we are compelled to have recourse to a majority vote. That is, if this thing is to be done as certain congressmen propose it shall be, the God in whose name this great Republic is to act, is to be determined by a vote! It follows, that such a being will be selected as the majority believe in and approve of; and "the minority will be bound by this decision. Everything which it is proper to submit to a vote of any people, is proper to be decided by that people. It is, moreover, proper, that under such circumstances the minority should submit to the majority so far as the matter submitted to a vote is concerned. How many of those who are clamoring for this innovation, would be willing to submit to majority vote the question of the God they should worship were they residents of Buddhist or Mohammedan countries? And is not such submission equally as just to the Christian there as to the Mohammedan here? It is not meet that our sense of justice become warped because we think we have the majority behind us, any more than it is suitable or commendable that we become too brave or aggressive when glancing over our shoulder we see a large crowd ready to support our forward movements.

If the majority have the right to choose the god of the nation, and in no other way under our form of government could one be chosen, then they have also the right to choose the forms by the use of which he shall be worshiped, and the practical life required in order to render him still further acceptable service. For it follows logically, that the right to select a god, has indissolubly connected with it the right to make such selection effective by providing for and enforcing by penal statutes if necessary, the worship of that god.

It seems, therefore, clear that when we concede the propriety of placing the name of God in the Constitution, or having the authoritative text-book of any religion's ordinances or sacred days observed by reason of the State's authority and interference, we have thereby submitted the whole question of religion to majority rule, and are honorably bound to submit to whatever decision that majority may make. The Patriot, therefore, now, as in the past, loudly protests against any attempt upon the part of the State to control the subject of religion. It is a usurpation which is only desired by those who, failing to have sufficient confidence in the innate power of their form of religion to make headway when others have an equal opportunity to advocate theirs, therefore wish and strive for an advantage by having the power of the State enlisted upon their side. If we consent to the choice of a god for our Constitution by the majority, we are then bound hand and foot. Our liberties are gone, our right of choice in matters of religion given away. Such a course would tend to the enslavement of this people, as it has to the enslavement of other peoples in the past. Beware!—Independent Patriot.
