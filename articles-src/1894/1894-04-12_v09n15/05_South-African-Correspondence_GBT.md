The agitation of the Sunday question still continues in the Colony, and no doubt will till the end. It will not "down," but will perturb the world till the warfare between truth and error shall be finished.

The most recent perturbation is in reference to Sunday concerts. One, Mr. Snozelle, advertised that on Sunday evening, Feb. 11, 1894, a "sacred concert" would be held in the opera house, and that a liberal per cent. of the proceeds would be given to St. George's Orphanage. The result was a full house, many having to stand for want of seats. There were more vacant pews in the churches than common as some preferred a "sacred concert" to a dry sermon. Financially it was a success and seventy-five dollars were sent, as advertised, to the orphanage; but it was promptly sent back, on the grounds that it was the spoil derived from Sunday desecration and they could not accept it, and thus become partners to such wickedness. The dean of Cape Town also wrote two letters in one of the dailies setting forth the question as he views it through his theological glasses, and denounced in scathing language the promoters of the "sacred" affair and all who attended.

This called forth a number of replies through the city papers. Some thought the orphanage and reverend dean acted in a godly manner; while others criticised severely the whole transaction. One writer (Mr. Snozelle) thought the good dean meant well in his way, but that it was a bigoted and narrow-minded way. He also reminded his reverence that there was not seating capacity in the city churches for near all the population, and asked him if he preferred that they visit the haunts of vice in the evening instead of viewing the paintings of Angelo, Titian, Correggio, and others, and listening to the singing and recitation of selections from such authors as Tennyson, Longfellow, and Mozart. Another correspondent, referring to the dean's letters, said:—

Seldom has the spirit of bigotry found plainer expression or language more harsh and unchristian than those two communications. Surely the reverend gentleman has forgotten the nature of Christ and his teachings when he penned them.

Another remarked that as the good dean had been instrumental in the donation being rejected he should go down into his own pocket and donate an equivalent amount. Another writer, a clergyman, wrote a stormy letter showing that the dean in his effort to sustain the sanctity of Sunday had misstated some facts concerning that institution. He also propounded to him a number of queries, such as to how he could read Sunday into the fourth commandment, and asked for a text somewhere in the Bible, no matter where, which attaches any sacredness whatever to the day. As yet the dean's authority has not been forthcoming.

That ecclesiastical bigotry is at the bottom of the whole agitation is evident. The exaltation of Sunday is the object sought. Empty pews and a full opera house are too much for the clergy to stand. No matter how many concerts are held, either sacred or profane, they call forth no remonstrance from the pastors until one is held on Sunday, then there is a mighty uproar. It is the controversy of the fourth century over again. Then, says Neander, "Church teachers were in truth often forced to complain that the latter (a circus) was vastly more frequented than the church," and because the "people congregate more to the circus than to the church," the Church having lost her power and not being able to compete with a circus petitioned the State for a law "that the public shows might be transferred from the Christian Sunday and feast days to some other day of the week." Again the Church having lost her heavenly power and not being able to stand the competition of a "sacred concert," seeks for a law to stop the concert. They petition Parliament, not Jehovah.

The agitation of the question has resulted in the formation of a Sunday league. What the objects of the "league" are we copy from the Cape Times of February 21:—

The objects of the league are as follows: (a) The promotion of a healthy public opinion on the Sunday question generally; (b) to oppose by legal and constitutional means any attempts in the legislature or elsewhere to further curtail the liberties of the subjects on Sunday; (c) to urge on Parliament the repeal or amendment of the Sunday ordinance in so far as it interferes with the sale of light refreshments, such as aerated waters, fruit, cakes, etc., on Sunday; (d) to obtain and encourage the working of the public railway service on the Sunday in a manner more widely satisfactory to the public than it is worked at present; (e) to promote and encourage entertainments of a purely intellectual and moral character, so that, while not interfering in any way with the proceedings or conduct of any religious body, the non-church goer may be induced to attend, and be benefited thereby.

This will doubtless result in further agitation of the question.
