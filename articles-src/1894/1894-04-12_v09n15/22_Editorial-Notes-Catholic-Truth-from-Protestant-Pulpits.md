The Catholic Standard says: "There are many hopeful 'signs in the air' as well as disturbing rumors from the press. Non-Catholic clergymen, knowingly or ignorantly, are helping to forward Catholic practice in the people's thoughts and teaching Catholic truths from Protestant pulpits." This is unquestionably true. Roman Catholic error is now ignorantly propagated from Protestant pulpits, and by Protestant organizations, with more subtle and successful efficiency than even from the Catholic cathedrals themselves.
