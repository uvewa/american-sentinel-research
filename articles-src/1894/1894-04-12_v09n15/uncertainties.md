## OCR Challenges

### Page 1, Line 23
- **Transcribed as:** "No. 45 BORN STREET, NEW YORK"
- **Uncertainty:** "BORN" appears clearly in the OCR but should likely be "BOND" (the actual address)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - OCR artifact, standard address was 43 Bond Street
- **Resolution:** Transcribed as appears in image to maintain accuracy

### Page 1, Line 117
- **Transcribed as:** "Psarissism"
- **Uncertainty:** Unusual word, possibly OCR error for "Pharisaism"
- **Confidence:** LOW - appears twice in the St. Louis Republic quotation
- **Resolution:** Transcribed as appears, likely intentional variant spelling or OCR error in original scan

### Page 3, Line 191
- **Author name:** "ALFRED MALLETT"
- **Uncertainty:** Name variant - previously seen as "Alfred Mallet" in other issues
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - double-T appears clearly in this scan
- **Resolution:** Transcribed as appears with double-T

### General Note
The Mistral OCR output was generally clean with minimal uncertainties. Most challenges were standard OCR artifacts (like "BORN" for "BOND") or archaic/variant spellings that are intentionally preserved per transcription rules.
