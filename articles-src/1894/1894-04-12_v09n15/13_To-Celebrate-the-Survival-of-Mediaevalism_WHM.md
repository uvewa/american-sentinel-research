The Theocrat, published at Johnstown, Pa., has, in its issue of March 31, this editorial paragraph:—

CENTENNIAL OF THE SUNDAY LAW.

Circulars have been sent out by the Pennsylvania Sabbath Association, suggesting that on April 22nd, when the Sunday law of 1794 reaches its hundredth anniversary, the various Sabbath associations, the churches, all Sabbath organizations, and the labor unions all over the State, hold local celebrations. This is a good move, and should be observed by all who are in sympathy with a proper observance of the holy Sabbath. Sermons should be preached on this subject. All our Sabbath-schools should give special attention to this centennial.

The existence of this survival of mediæval error and bigotry, on its statute books, is a disgrace to the State of Pennsylvania,—yet it is the pride of the Pennsylvania "Sabbath Association." Do the members of this association realize that they will live to see the Pennsylvania Sunday law, of 1794, used to the shame of the State, for the persecution of Christian men for conscience' sake? When they see that, will they realize their error? They will see it; but it remains to be seen whether they will acknowledge their mistake. It will be too late then to rectify it,—even though some of those who now celebrate, not knowing what they do, should be the very ones to suffer from its persecuting power. W. H. M.
