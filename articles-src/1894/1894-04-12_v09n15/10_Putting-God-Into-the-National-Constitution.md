RABBI E. N. CALISCH, of Richmond, Va., as reported by the American Hebrew, has lately uttered some most appropriate and truthful criticisms upon the movement of the National Reformers, for the amendment of the Constitution so as to make this legally "a Christian nation." What ever may be the purposes of these reformers, the success of their scheme, would be the beginning of such evils, as have always attended the union of Church and State. It is of no account that they protest, "We do not favor the union of Church and State; we seek simply the union of Christianity and the State." But the execution of their scheme would be more than mere union; it would be the subordination of the State to some form of organized Christianity, and, unless the tendency which is now strongest is rapidly and radically changed, Roman Catholicism would be that representative of Christianity. The papal power can well afford to wait if this movement, which is urged mainly by "Reformed Presbyterians," can be carried to a successful issue.

No movement could be made by the representatives of the pope, which would be more favorable to the genius and purposes of the Papal Church, than this which these most protesting Protestants have undertaken. Rabbi Calisch said:—

They forget that religion is a thing of the heart, and not of legislation. You cannot enact belief, or place faith within a man's bosom by putting it on the statute book. Law cannot control the struggles of the soul, or legislation check or restrain its flight. There may be a thousand constitutions, with a thousand preambles to each, and a thousand mentionings of the Deity in each, yet they will never turn the atheistic heart or place God within a bosom where he is not already unthroned and acknowledged.

For this reason, the union of Church and State is wrong; for this reason, that union, wherever it has been, has been dangerous and pernicious; and for this reason, this resolution, which seeks to re-establish this union, is a threat to the safety of the country, whose greatest blessing has been in the separation of these two great factors of human civilization.

It is probable that this bill will not become a law. It must pass the House and the Senate with two thirds majority in each; it must be ratified and concurred in by the conventions or legislatures of three-fourths of the States of the Union. But it is in every degree possible. The sense of justice in some of the followers of the creed favored therein may be strong enough for them to admit that this resolution is an infringement on the rights and privileges of many citizens, but it will not be strong enough, in all instances, to produce any opposition to it. Its advocates will be tireless and ubiquitous. Though many of them will, doubtless, be ministers of the gospel and pronounced professors of religion, yet we know, from experience, that not, in all cases, will they hesitate to use means unscrupulous and dishonest. With them the end justifies the means. To have it formally and constitutionally declared that this is a "Christian country and that its glory and grandeur are due to the name of Christ," will be sufficient to set in motion all the machination of politics. All the tricks, methods and media, known and yet to be invented, will be resorted to. Appeals will be made to cupidity, fear, superstition, social ambition, to the love of gain and distinction, and, like Esau's mess of pottage, the birthright of the dearest privilege of American citizenship will be hartered for a vote for a hangman's office or the janitorship of a public building.

It will be well if the public mind can be aroused to understand the possible, and the actual evils which lie underneath this seemingly devout attempt to re-introduce a state of affairs which would give the death-blow to religious freedom, if the proposed amendment should become operative.—Evangel and Sabbath Outlook.
