DURING the last quarter of this century has occurred a change in the fortunes of the Catholic Church in America which is almost a transformation; a change which possesses certain of the aspects of the miraculous, of the supernatural. English Catholicism, under the exalted guidance of the four great cardinals, has signalized her release from legal persecution by stepping to the very front, not only in her first and most glorious duty of winning back a world weary of the follies of materialism to the faith. Here, also, in the United States, the torch of the new life is passed from hand to hand, and already the Catholic Church is assuming every prerogative of leadership. Within the last fifty years, she has advanced from a position of comparative weakness to the primacy; she is claiming the right of arbitration between capital and labor.—Ralph Adams, in Catholic World.
