In view of the proposed amendment to the Constitution, the following words from Oliver Johnson, in an article on "Morality in the Public Schools," in the Atlantic Monthly for June, 1888, are to the point:—

But suppose that Christianity, as the nominal religion of the majority of citizens, were adopted as the religion of the State; even then the confusion would not be ended. Shall the State be Catholic or Protestant, Orthodox or Liberal? Shall it acknowledge the infallibility of the Church and pope, or adopt the Bible as an infallible guide? What doctrine shall be set forth in the creed, and what condemned as heretical? What rites and forces shall be prescribed? To entertain such questions is to remove the foundation of republican government, and revive the doctrines and associations, out of which gave the Inquisition, with all its bloody horrors, and make the stake and the fagot once more the terror of dissenters from the orthodox faith.

The objects of a republican State are purely civil and secular, relating to the present not to a future life; to the duties which citizens owe to each other, not to those which they owe to the invisible God. It knows men neither as Christians, Mohammedans, nor Jews, neither as Catholics, Protestants, nor Skeptics, Theists nor Atheists, Orthodox nor Liberals, but simply and solely as citizens extending equal protection to all. The Hindu may erect his temple, the Mohammedan his mosque, the Buddhist his shrine, the Chinaman his joeshome, and the Jew his synagogue, just as freely as the Christian may hold his cathedral, church, or chapel; and the protection of the Government is extended equally to all the various forms of worship, so far as they do not endanger the public peace. Still further, the Infidel, the Atheist, or the Freethinker, may erect his hall wherever he lists, and the meetings held therein will be under the same protection as the assemblies for the worship of God. Such is the nature, the height and depth, the length and breadth, of that liberty which is the beast of this Republic, and which is not its shame, but its glory.

Then, after quoting from Article 6 of the Constitution and the First Amendment, and also the treaty with Tripoli in regard to religion, Mr. Johnson says:—

In this treaty, and in the constitutional provisions above cited, the fathers struck with a firm hand the keynote of that anthem of religious liberty which surprised and enchanted the civilized world. Historically, some of the States are older than the nation, and if, from their constitutions, laws, and judicial decisions, utterances not in harmony with the national keynote are sometimes heard, it is because the former have not yet been brought quite up to concert pitch.

We have among us a considerable class of religious men who, while they disclaim any wish to remarry the Church to the State, do yet slumber at the complete logical and necessary results of the divorce. They insist that the State is bound to be Christian, to assert the being of God, the divinity of Christ and the infallible authority of the Scriptures; and that the refusal to do this proves it to be godless and profane. They forget that religion is a matter exclusively between the individual soul and God, and that he judges men, not in the mass, nor as gathered in associations, for whatever purpose formed, but as persons, each one being required to give account of himself. The State being formed for secular purposes only, cannot interfere with citizens in their personal relations to their Maker. But no inference prejudicial to Christianity or any other form of religion is to be drawn from this non-interference. If the State does not affirm and propagate religion, so neither does it oppose nor obstruct it. In protecting freedom of speech and action for its champions and supporters, it does for religion all that it has any right to do. To murmur because it confines itself to secular affairs, and refuses to enter the sphere of religion, is as unreasonable as to complain of railroads because they do not provide facilities for crossing the ocean, of a court of justice that it does not perform the duties of a legislature, or of a threshing machine because it does not fulfill the uses of a magnetic telegraph. In regard to Christianity, I go still farther, and affirm that the State could not lend itself to its direct support without doing it far more injury than good. All experience goes to show that Christianity prospers best when Church and State move in spheres entirely distinct from each other, and each minds its own business. It was to his disciples, not to any earthly power, that Jesus addressed the command, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature;" and if the Church had always been as free from alliances with the State as it was before the time of Constantine, and as it is now in this country, the progress of Christianity would have been far more rapid than it has been. The Church, indeed, can much better afford to be persecuted by the State than to fall into its evidence. They are plotters of mischief for Christianity who are seeking to incorporate their theology in the Constitution of the United States; and may form of religion which cannot endure the freedom of our institutions, but seeks the sword of temporal power to enforce its claims, attests thereby its conscious weakness, and brands itself as spurious.

These are sound sentiments well expressed. The italics, which are not in the original print, serve to emphasize expressions already made emphatic by truth.
