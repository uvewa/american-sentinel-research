The Catholic Review, of April 7, in commenting on an article by Rev. Frank B. Vrooman in the last Arena, says:—

Here and there a non-Catholic sees the absurdity of making the living Church of Christ subordinate to a collection of ancient manuscripts, or copies of manuscripts, written in various languages by different writers without concert or common system or relation, now translated more or less correctly and said to be subject to individual interpretation.

Such paragraphs as this, in reference to the word of God, show how closely allied the Roman Catholic Church, the Higher Criticism, and Spiritualism, already are.
