"The abolition of Fast Day in Massachusetts, legally accomplished on Friday, is personally a triumph for ex-Governor Russell, who first, though unsuccessfully, urged it upon the legislature. The day had come to be only a pious mockery, in reality nothing but a general holiday masquerading as a time of fasting and prayer. So strong had been the impression of the evil wrought by such insincerity in the name of religion, that many of the more thoughtful religious leaders of the State have for some time advocated making an end of the simulacrum. Its abolition will doubtless seem to many timid souls as little better than a plunge into atheism, but it is really in the interest of religion as well as of common sense and sound ideas of government."—The Nation, March 22, 1894.
