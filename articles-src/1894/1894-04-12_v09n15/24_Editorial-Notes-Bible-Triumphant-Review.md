Two pamphlets, Nos. 5 and 37, of "The Anti-Infidel Library," published at 47 Cornhill, Boston, Mass., and edited by H. L. Hastings, editor of the Christian, have reached the SENTINEL table. The larger pamphlet is a work of 155 pages, entitled "The Bible Triumphant,"—a reply to a work entitled "144 Self-contradictions of the Bible," by Elizabeth A. Reed, Member of the Philosophical Society of Great Britain, author of "Hindu Literature, or the Ancient Books of India." The treatment of these propositions put forward by skepticism is most scholarly and in the main satisfactory, but it is necessary to point out two errors which are evident even on a cursory examination. Upon proposition 41, "The Sabbath Instituted, Ex. 22:8,—The Sabbath Repudiated, Isa. 1:13; Rom. 14:5; Gal. 4:5," this writer comments thus:—

The keeping of the seventh day, as holy time, was also instituted under the law and sanctioned by Jehovah in the Jewish dispensation. . . . But the keeping of the seventh day passed away with the law of which it was a component part. It is well to devote one day in the seven exclusively to the worship of God. The disciples met on the first day of the week, and it was hallowed by the resurrection of our Lord. Hence we recognize this as the day of worship; but there is now no law of God which commands us to observe the Mosaic Sabbath.

Thoughtful students of the Bible at this time know that the institution and sanction of the seventh day as holy time was from creation, and is of the same perpetuity as any other of the commandments. The ceremonial law which was typical in its observances passed away when that which it typified was realized, but the fourth commandment is not a part of the ceremonial observances, but of the eternal law of God. Christ and his disciples always observed the seventh day "according to the commandment,"—the Sabbath is not the Sabbath of Moses, but of God, and its observance is as binding now "according to the commandment" as when Christ so observed it upon earth or at the creation when he instituted it.

Again in proposition 110,—"The Law was Superseded by the Christian Dispensation,—The Law was not Superseded by the Christian Dispensation,"—this failure to distinguish between the moral and ceremonial law,—between the ten commandments and the Jewish ritual leads here a second time into fatal error.

The second pamphlet is a tract of thirty-six pages upon the "Higher Criticism," by H. L. Hastings. This brochure is both able and eloquent, containing many pungeot and quotable paragraphs, one cannot begin to quote because each succeeding sentence would clamor just as loudly for recognition. Every one afflicted with the "Higher Criticism" should read this.
