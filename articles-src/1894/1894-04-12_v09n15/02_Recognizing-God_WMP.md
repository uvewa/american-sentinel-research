The St. Louis Republic of March 13, has the following concerning the proposed "Christian" amendment to the national Constitution:—

Undoubtedly there are some very worthy people among the ministers who have spent the week in Washington supporting the absurd Morse resolution "for the recognition of God in the Constitution," but their worthiness does not excuse the folly of the proceeding.

The reasons for the separation of Church and State are too well known to need repetition here, but there is room for a statement of some of the objections to the form of Psarissism represented by those who demand that in form at least this Government shall be changed to a theocracy.

The community at large has an instinctive distrust for all parade of religion; for all pretentious and obtrusive gisty. The man who should every morning, before opening his business for the day, summon his employés around him and "recognize God" by leading them in public prayer, would lose business and become an object of general distrust, not because people generally distrust religion, but because they have a wholesome dread of false pretenses.

The general instinct does not err. The man who carries his religion on his sleeve; who makes an advertisement of it and uses it to attract attention to himself and his merits, is generally what people take him to be. Neither in business nor in politics nor anywhere else is it safe to trust those who thus proclaim their religion on the corners of the streets.

At the opening of the French Revolution there was an admirable illustration of this species of Psarissism. The Girondins, representing the moderate and conservative element of the French Republicans, were opposed to any profession of theocratic government, but another element insisted that "God must be recognized."

This element was the Jacobins, with Robespierre as their leader, and they carried the day. As the champion of the Almighty, Robespierre forced through a complimentary reference to the "Supreme Being," declaring that the Republic was inaugurated under His "auspices."

This done, the Jacobins proceeded to decapitate the king and to set up the guillotine in the Place de la Revolution—all "under the auspices of the Supreme Being!"

Rev Joseph Cook, of Boston, is not a Robespierre, to be sure, nor is Congressman Morse, of Massachusetts, a Danton; so, perhaps, nothing very serious will come of the zeal which leads them to make a public exposure of their piety.

This has the right ring. In this degenerate age when so many are clamoring for a Sunday law and are denouncing our "godless Constitution," we are glad to see such outspoken, forcible, historical and truthful words as to the folly of uniting Church and State; in short, the supreme folly and wickedness of a hypocritical theocracy. The truth of the matter is, instead of recognizing God in the Constitution, these would-be National Reformers will soon recognize the devil in it,—Sunday in it,—enforced morality in it, the beast and his image, and then they will recognize the Inquisition in it and then woe to both civil and religious liberty.

As long ago as December 15, 1871, the Christian Statesman said: "How long will it be before the Christian masses of this country can be roused to enact a law compelling their public servants to respect the Sabbath (Sunday)?" The same organ in the same issue says further, that "it is in four of such declarations in our fundamental instruments of law as shall show that this is a Christian nation, and that Christian morality is to be enforced over all the inhabitants of its soil."

It is true that Rev. Joseph Cook is not a Robespierre nor Elijah Morse a Danton, yet as the former stands so high in the estimation of the theological world, and the latter in the political, they can do so much the more harm, and according to the course they are now pursuing, it seems that they would rather crush liberty a thousand times than to permit a moment's violation of their idol (Sunday).

These God-recognizing agitators ignore what Milton has said: "Give me the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties." What Iredell has said: "I shall always respect that jealousy which arises from the loss of public liberty;" the words of William Lloyd Garrison: "Liberty is hunted with bloodhounds;" the words of General Grant: "Keep the Church and State forever separate;" and what is greatest of all, the words of Him who "spake as never man spake:" "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's."

WM. PENNIMAN.
