The question of religious education in the public schools, so long a bone of contention here, has given rise to violent controversy in the London School Board also, extending over months of stormy agitation. It was settled for the moment a few weeks ago by the adoption by the board of a scheme for such instruction, but as the vote was close, 27 against 21, and as the strong opposition is bitter in the extreme, and regards itself as unjustly beaten, the decision is by no means final. Doubtless the contest will be carried into the election of a new board when it occurs, and thus the field of battle will be greatly enlarged.

The plan of religious education adopted by a majority so narrow is defined in a circular addressed to the teachers of the schools. In brief, it directs that the Bible shall be used as a "text book," from which the teacher "should give such explanations in the Christian religion and morality as are suited to the capacities of children of various ages attending the schools of the board." This instruction must not "diverge from the presentation of the Christian religion which is revealed in the Bible;" and the teacher is at liberty to elucidate and enforce Christian principles by referring to any part of the Bible.

These principles the circular defines as including "a belief in God the Father as our Creator, in God the Son as our Redeemer, and in God the Holy Ghost as our Sanctifier." It says, further, that the "Board cannot approve of any teaching which denies either the divine or the human nature of the Lord Jesus Christ, or that leaves on the minds of the children any other impression than that they are bound to trust and serve him as their God and Lord." It also gives liberty to the teacher to use hymns in the religious exercises, concluding with the doxology or prayers other than the Lord's prayer. Finally, it forbids any "attempt whatever to attach the children to any particular religious denomination," and declares that the religious opinions of candidates will influence neither their appointment nor their promotion, and that they will not be subjected to any questions as to their religious belief.

Very naturally and reasonably the opposition to such a scheme was powerful and intense. Neither did it come wholly nor in chief part from members of the board who might be accused of religious infidelity. Included in the minority of twenty-one were seven ministers, who opposed the circular on the ground that it justified dogmatic teaching, or at least opened the door for it. Of course the objection is well founded, for the teachers will be almost irresistibly tempted to give such a bias to their religious instruction, according to their own belief, owing to the large liberty allowed them in the interpretation of the Bible; and it is the difference in such interpretation that causes the difference in the dogmatic teachings of the churches.

It is this irreconcilable controversy which makes impossible religious instruction in schools which are supported by the public, and in which children of all religious beliefs are pupils. The opposition, too, comes from parents of a firm religious belief rather than those who are infidels. The agnosticism of this day is indifferent to dogmatic religion, rather than hostile to it. Very many parents, more especially the fathers, who are usually the agnostics, make no objection to the religious education of their children, deeming it generally useful to them because of its moral cultivation, by reason of which, desirable reverence and elevation of sentiment are encouraged. Where the parents are religious believers, with a definite creed, they are fearful of any religious instruction of which a dogmatic tinge offensive to them may be imparted.

It is obvious that the fight over religious education in London is not decided by the adoption of this report in the School Board. That result is rather the signal for renewed hostilities in the board itself, which will arouse public agitation when a new board is to be elected.—N. Y. Sun.
