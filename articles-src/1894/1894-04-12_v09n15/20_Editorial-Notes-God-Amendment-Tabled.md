A Washington special, of March 27, says: "The proposed amendment to the preamble of the Constitution, 'acknowledging the supreme authority and just government of Almighty God in all the affairs of men and nations,' was finally disposed of by the House Committee on Judiciary to-day when by a viva voce vote it was decided to allow the resolution to lie on the table, the only dissenting voice against such action being that of Representative W. A. Stone, of Pennsylvania."
