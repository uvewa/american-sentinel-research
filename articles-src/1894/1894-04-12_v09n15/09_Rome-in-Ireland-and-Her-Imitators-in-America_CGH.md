In the political contest some time since in Ireland between the candidates Mr. Mahoney and Mr. Davitt, the latter was supported by the Catholic clergy; and the manner in which they gave their support was so corrupt that the matter was finally taken into court. Mr. Justice Johnson at the hearing said:—

The respondent (Mr. Davitt) placed himself, and left himself in the hands of the clergy to manage and procure his election.

The following testimony will show something of the way in which his election was managed and procured:—

Anthony Smith testified: "I was a few yards from Reilly; he was addressing some remarks, but to no one in particular. Reilly said that every one should be allowed to vote according to his conscience. Then Father Clark said, 'Withdraw those words,' and I turned for an instant, and when I looked round, Reilly was on the ground, and appeared insensible."

John Cowley swore as follows: "The Rev. Mr. Tynan is my parish priest. The day before the election Father Tynan spoke to me about my vote. I said I would vote for neither party. He told me I was bound to vote for my religion on pain of being expelled from the church." Did he add anything to that? "He did, that I would be deprived of Christian burial when I died."

Mr. Michael Saurin, J. P., of Harristown, said:— "I attended mass on June 12th at Castleportan. Father O'Connell preached. He referred to a meeting at Clonard, and said he expected every man, woman, and child in the parish would attend. He told them plainly it was no longer a political matter, but it was a matter of their holy religion. If any were absent he must know why, and any that wilfully absented themselves without a just cause, he would meet them on the highway, and the byway, and at the rails, and that he would fire, or he would 'set fire to their heels and toes.'"

This is Rome in Ireland. This is the end to which Rome is working in America. It is "a matter of their holy religion" that such candidates are supported as the church dictates, and of course who are pledged to the support of the church. Who in this country are furthering her ends, and teaching the principles of her doctrines with greater zeal, or with more destructive consequences, than those religious organizations who are trying to place God in the Constitution, control the ballot box, and secure the election of only such candidates as will become tools of the church? The following appears in the Cincinnati Enquirer of February 22:—

IN THE RING.

KANSAS CITY CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR UNION GOES INTO POLITICS.

KANSAS CITY, Mo., February, 21.—Probably for the first time in the history of the organization the Christian Endeavor Union is to enter the political field and work for the cause of good government at the coming spring elections. At a joint meeting of the Y. P. C. E. and Y. M. C. A. organizations, resolutions were adopted advocating methods of work, the preparation of a list of voters, the personal and systematic solicitation of voters to fulfill all their political duties, the assistance of voters by offering full information as to registration, primaries, officers to be elected, and candidates and tickets in the field. It is also the intention to have tickets distributed at the churches Sunday, on which will be presented the question, "Are you registered?"

Is it that these organizations fear no one will be elected at the spring elections if they do not bestir themselves and see that some one is? Oh, no! Some one is sure to be elected. What then? The wrong person might go into office. It is "for the cause of good government" that these "Christian" organizations have entered the political arena. But He with whose name these organizations link their own said that his government or "kingdom is not of this world." So upon what principle have these organizations left the cause of Him whose name they bear? Can it be other than that of Rome, that politics properly "is a matter of their holy religion"? But when some members of these organizations, as well as those who are not members, do not desire to support the candidates which their organization wishes them to, what then? When once the principle is adopted, it inevitably leads to the logical result. Some of its workings have just been shown in the Irish election case.

But now that the Christian (?) societies have stepped "in the ring," as the Esquirer puts it, which society will place its nominees in office, and finally bring politics and politicians under its control? Why, the one numerically and politically the strongest, to be sure. And as every one knows, or may know, that organization is the Catholic Church. And it is for this very thing that this church is most earnestly striving. But when the political offices are to be doled out from the hands of the strongest religio-political organization, those who receive them will have to shape their legislation to suit the dictates of that organization. No one can do that so well as its own members. Then will there not very soon be seen in this country the very thing that is now seen in Ireland, the candidates place themselves and leave themselves in the hands of the clergy, and of the same clergy as in Ireland, that their election may be procured? In view of this who cannot plainly see the evil of the whole principle of the mixing of those two elements which should be forever kept separate, politics and religion?

C. G. HOWELL.
