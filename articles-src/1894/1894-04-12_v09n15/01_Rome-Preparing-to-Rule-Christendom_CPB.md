A GOOD deal has been said of late in these columns concerning the aggression of the papacy in the United States, but what is true in this country is also true of European countries. Rome's purpose is to again rule Christendom.

THERE exists a world-wide condition of affairs exceedingly favorable to the pretensions of the Roman hierarchy. For years modern civilization has apparently been about to crumble, like the Roman empire, under its own magnificence. Those conditions essential to stability have not been preserved, and the recognition of impending ruin has become well-nigh universal.

The jealousy of European nations has imposed upon them burdens too great to be borne indefinitely. Immense standing armies have depleted national treasuries to the verge of bankruptcy. Indeed, some of the nations have been unable to meet their obligations already; but the armies must be maintained at any cost, for ability to repel an invader is the price of national autonomy.

UPON the unnatural condition created by exorbitant taxation and the withdrawal of so many thousands of men from industrial pursuits, has been superinduced unparalleled commercial depression. Not alone from Europe and America, but also from India, Australasia and South America comes the cry of "hard times." Outside of Russia there have been no crop failures, and yet the people cry for bread; the money metals of the world have not been exhausted, and yet trade is hampered because of lack of a circulating medium. Money, instead of seeking investment, is hiding in safe-deposit vaults, while the wheels of industry rust in idleness, and hundreds of thousands of operatives grow gaunt and desperate with hunger.

ANOTHER element that renders the situation still more serious is the fact that in most countries popular education has multiplied the necessities of the people, without at the same time increasing, in a corresponding ratio, their ability to supply their wants. Tens of thousands have, as the German Emperor declared a few years since, been educated beyond the station they must of necessity fill in life; and the result is more deep and wide-spread discontent, more desperation, and more power to effectively give expression to that consuming unrest born of hope long deferred.

FOR many years the various avenues of egress served as safety valves for Europe. The discontented and the oppressed could emigrate to America, a land of freedom and of plenty. But now the limit has been reached. The tide of settlement and of civilization having reached the Pacific Coast, crossing the Rockies and the Sierras in its irresistible flow, is sweeping back upon itself, and men now see little hope of bettering their condition by emigration. It is no longer true that "Uncle Sam is rich enough to give us all a farm," and the submerged millions of Europe, and of our own congested centers of population, are beginning to realize that there is no longer an asylum to which they can flee. But one avenue of hope is open to the sub-strata of society, namely, a re-distribution of the wealth of the world, and this is the demand now being made, and which will ere long be heard in thunder tones. Already we see the fulfillment of the words of our Lord: "Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things that are coming on the earth;" and soon will come that which is foretold by the apostle James, "Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire."

Rome sees all this, not from the standpoint of the prophecy it is true, but from the standpoint of patent facts. And seeing it she is preparing to take every advantage afforded both by existing and by impending conditions. Rome has never been modest in her claims, but within less than half a decade she has become more bold than even her wont in asserting her powers and in pressing her claims as the saviour of society, the panacea of all ills that afflict or threaten the body politic of the world.

Rome claims to be able to control the masses as no other power can; and to a certain extent her claim has a substantial foundation in fact. But eventually Rome will fail. Her siren song will charm the nations for a time, and her spiritual despotism will awe the multitudinous votaries into submission for a season; but the limit will be reached, and then will the powers of earth "hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire;" but not yet. It now needs no prophet to foretell a season of triumph for the great harlot before her final destruction.

BUT Rome's final failure is seen only in the light of the "sure word of prophecy," a light which she as skillfully obscures as she artfully plots for universal spiritual domination. And so completely has she covered the one and so ably has she presented her claim to the other, that the eyes of the world are even now being turned toward the Vatican for a solution of the most gigantic problem that has ever confronted the race, namely, the preservation of civil society from threatened ruin.

THE Catholic World, for March, has a significant article, which has a direct bearing on this subject. It is entitled "The Dawning of the Twentieth Century in Europe," and from the standpoint of the present delineates the probable condition of affairs in the near future. In common with the ablest statesmen of the world, the author of the article in question holds that ere long Europe will be the scene of a war far surpassing anything that the world has ever seen. He says:

Horished at the vast outpouring of blood and the frightful waste of material resources, the American people and press at last began to ask what was the use of it all.

The word "arbitration" was upon every tongue, and all eyes were turned instinctively towards the illustrious occupant of the Vatican. His was the only voice in the whole world which would have a chance of being listened to in that pandemonium of passion and universal horror.

The word was spoken, and was at length listened to. A general armistice was first arranged, and then a conference of plenipotentiaries was convened in St. Petersburg.

The propositions of each power were formally submitted, after full instructions from the home governments, and each plenipotentiary gave a solemn assurance that he would be bound by the decision which his holiness, after three months' discussion of the proposals, with the help of two leading jurisconsults from America, should render.

As to the settlement of the Roman question, the suggestion came from America. The idea was to follow the example of the American Union with regard to the City of Washington and the District of Columbia. This is a sort of neutral territory, whose affairs are controlled by commissioners nominated by Congress. There are no representatives for the district, and no elections in it consequently.

The patrimony of the church has been restored, and the government of the city and territory is placed in the hands of commissioners chosen by the holy father. Florence is the capital of the republic, and Rome once more the capital of Christendom.

Now Europe, whilst retaining her ancient divisions, is traversed by a series of neutralized States which serve as barriers between the rival powers; the right of free passage on all the high seas, including the Mediterranean and the Dardanelles, is guaranteed to the whole world, and the head of the Catholic Church is at last free to deal without let or hindrance with every portion of his wide spreading domain. The eternal city has wakened up from the fitful fever of Revolution; the money changers have been driven from the temple, and an era of blessed tranquility now seems to have dawned at last over long-distracted Europe. The pope once more is free.

This to some may seem chimerical, but it is the cherished dream and fond ambition of the papacy, and to its accomplishment all the powers of that mighty hierarchy are being devoted. Every art known to "the mystery of iniquity" is being used. Is it asked with what success? Look at the proud Bismarck, and the powerful German Empire prostrate at the feet of Rome; look at Italy, united, it is true, with the seat of empire the "City of the Seven Hills," but the most bankrupt and distressed of all nations, not excepting even the "Sick Man of the East."

Then turn to our own country, with a population of seventy millions, yet for all that, writhing in the grasp of Rome by means of less than ten millions of her votaries. The futile efforts of President Harrison and his advisers to discontinue the appropriations to Catholic contract schools, though seconded by united Protestantism, speaks volumes, and tells of a power that should be hated, but whether hated or not, must be feared, and is too certainly felt to be ignored. The success, political and otherwise, of popery in the United States, is exerting a world-wide influence in favor of the Roman hierarchy and the claims of the Vatican to universal, spiritual domination. Nor is this an accident; Rome, and the master mind back of Rome, whose representative Rome is, designed to have it so, and Rome is making the most of it, both in America and in Europe.

With consummate skill every development in the political, industrial, or social world is turned to account by Rome. To avoid a war some years since which Germany dared not undertake because of France, Bismarck turned to the pope as arbitrator; and Rome, seizing the fact, has ever since, in season and out of season, urged that "his holiness" be made the arbiter of the world. In its issue of February 17, in an article on "The Pope as International Arbitrator," the Catholic Mirror says:—

International arbitration is gaining ground more and more, and it promises to hasten the day when the sword shall be sheathed forever. We have seen its favorable results in the decision given by Leo XIII. in the case of the Caroline Islands, a dispute between Germany and Spain, and, still more recently, in the French decision in our own Behring Sea trouble. . . . This is, indeed, a sign of the times.

Then, after quoting a suggestion that the pope be, by common consent, made arbiter, the Mirror adds:—

This appears to be a wise suggestion; and Bismarck, in selecting the pope to decide the Caroline Islands' dispute, showed that he was of a like opinion. The day may not be far distant when the nations will adopt this method of settling their differences.

This subject was made prominent at the Parliament of Religious held last fall in Chicago. In a paper read before the Congress, September 23, Thomas J. Semmes said:—

The oldest treaty now on record made by an English king with a foreign power was arranged by Pope John XV., A. D. 1002, and drawn up in his name. In 1298 Boniface VIII acted as arbitrator between Philip Bel and Edward I.

In 1883 the Senate of the United States voted in favor of inserting in our treaties an arbitration clause, the arbitrators to consist of eminent jurisconsults not engaged in politics. President Grant, in his message to Congress in 1873, myelically said: "I am disposed to believe that the author of the universe is preparing the world to become a single nation speaking the same language, which will hereafter render armies and navies superfluous." In 1874, Congress, by a joint resolution, declared that the people of the United States recommended that an arbitration tribunal be constituted in place of war, and the President was authorized to open negotiations for the establishment of a system of international rules for the settlement of controversies without resort to war.

In December, 1882, President Arthur announced, in his message to Congress, that he was ready to participate in any measure tending to "guarantee peace on earth."

During the century from 1793 to 1893 there have been fifty-eight international arbitrations. . . . From 1793 to 1848, a period of fifty-five years, there were nine arbitrations; there were fifteen from 1848 to 1870, a period of twenty-two years; there were fourteen from 1870 to 1880, and twenty from 1880 to 1893.

The most interesting arbitration of the century was that in which the highest representative of moral force in the world was accepted in 1883 by the apologist of material force to mediate between Germany and Spain. Leo XIII. revived the role of the pope in the middle ages.

The obstacles to an international code are not insurmountable, but the assent of nations to the establishment of a permanent tribunal of arbitration depends upon the practicability of so organizing it as to secure impartiality. Many suggestions have been made by the wise and learned, by philosophers, statesmen and philanthropists, but none seem to be free from objection. In despair the eyes of some are fixed on the pope.

An interesting quotation from the Spectator and English Review, says: "Humanity is in search of an arbitrator whose impartiality is indisputable. In many respects the pope is, by position, designed for this office. He occupies a rank which permits monarchs as well as republics to have recourse to him without sacrifice of dignity. As a consequence of his mission the pope is not only impartial between all nations but he is at such a degree of elevation that their differences are imperceptible to him. The difficulty about religion is becoming weaker every day. . . . The fact that the most haughty statesman of Europe (Prince Bismarck) recognizes in the face of the world that he can, without loss of dignity, submit his conduct in an international affair to the judgment of the pope, is an extraordinary proof that the pope still occupies an exceptional position in our skeptical modern world."

Why should not the exceptional position of the pope be utilized by the nations of the world? He is the highest representative of moral force on earth; over 200,000,000 of Christians scattered throughout all nations stand at his back, with a moral power which no other human being can command, no longer a temporal sovereign the ambition of hegemony cannot affect his judgment, religion and State are practically disassociated throughout Christendom, so that on matters of religion all are free to follow the dictates of conscience without fear of the civil power, and therefore political motives cannot disturb his equilibrium.

The tide is running strong in the direction indicated by Mr. Semmes. As shown in the outset of this article, the existing condition of affairs is exceedingly favorable to the consummation of Rome's ambition in this direction; and above all, we know from the word of God that Rome is yet to say in her heart, "I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow." But, praise God! her reign will be short; "for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her."
