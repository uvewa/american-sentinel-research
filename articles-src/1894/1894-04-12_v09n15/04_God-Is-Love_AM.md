"God is love;" he is the very source of love. Through love he created the worlds and placed beings upon them to do his will and glorify him. Upon this earth he placed man, and it was his design that he should be happy. For this reason he made him a free moral agent, that is, a being that could either obey him or not obey him. Thus man would be free, and therefore happy.

But man disobeyed his Creator—the God of love. He transgressed the commandment of God—"Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat,"—and so came "short of the glory of God." Before this he knew only good, but now he knew both good and evil. He lost prior with God and had not the power to do that which was good, for he was the servant of the originator of sin. "To whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey." Instead of being the child of God, he was the child of the evil one.

Now, had he chosen, the Omnipotent could have compelled man to obey him. But "God is love," and how could he take that which is dearer to man than all else—liberty—from him, and so make him a slave to do as compelled? God had a better way. His love caused him to do something to restore man to his original plan. Rather than destroy man, or take his liberty from him, he gave his only begotten Son to die for him, so that he might have the power to do that which is good—to keep the commandments of God.

Jesus Christ is an example of those whom God would have to inhabit the new earth. He chose to do his Father's will. He kept the commandments from choice, not through being compelled to do so. He was, in the flesh, as liable to fall as was Adam, being of the same flesh with man, and having the same evil one to tempt him; but his love for God caused him to be loyal to him and to his word. God would have us serve him even as Jesus Christ did—from love, from choice, and only such are accepted of him. "If ye love me, keep my commandments." Those who are compelled to serve God are no better in his sight than those who make no profession.

God has not changed since the beginning, for in him "there is no variableness neither shadow of turning." So it is not his will that any be compelled to serve him now any more than he compelled Adam to serve him. As God is love so his children are love. They do everything from love even as he does. Christ's love led him to offer his life for sinful man; it led him to keep his Father's commandments, and he kept all as they were given in the beginning. No change had taken place in them when he was on the earth, and he made no change, for he said that not "one jot or one tittle" should "pass from the law till all be fulfilled." Indeed, there needs no change in that which is perfect, and the word of God tells us that the law is perfect. A perfect law needs no revision.

Christ kept the Sabbath "according to the commandment," which is the seventh day. There are those in the world to-day keeping the seventh day, professing to serve God, and there are those who are keeping the first day as the Sabbath of the Lord, and professing to serve God. Which is right? One must be right and the other wrong. But no matter here which is right. Whether those who keep the seventh day as the Sabbath of the Lord or those who keep the first day are right, the one has not the right to compel the other to keep a certain day because he thinks that day is the Sabbath. God does not require it. He says: "Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn."

The controversy is between good and evil. Those who have done good have always been persecuted by those who have done evil. The children of Satan have always persecuted the children of God, and so it will be till the end of the world. In times past Catholics persecuted Protestants. Which was right, Catholicism or Protestantism? To-day, Sunday-keepers are persecuting Sabbath-keepers. Which are right?

ALFRED MALLETT.
