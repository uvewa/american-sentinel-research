The Christian Advocate of this city notes the formation of a Jewish Sabbath Association, and says: "An association has been formed among the Jews of this city for securing a more general observance of the Sabbath by their co-religionists. Among its features will be the establishment of an employment bureau, to bring together employers who wish to observe the Sabbath and allow their hands to do so, and working people who desire the privilege, and the organization of Sabbath Observance Committees in the various trades and professions. It will also seek the amendment of the existing legislation of the State, so that more adequate protection may be secured for those who observe the seventh day and follow their callings on Sunday."
