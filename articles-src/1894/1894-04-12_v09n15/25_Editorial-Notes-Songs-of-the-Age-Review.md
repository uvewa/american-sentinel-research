The SENTINEL is in receipt of a neatly bound booklet, bearing the title "Songs of the Age," by Col. Dudley H. Davis. The mechanical work on this little book is admirable, the typography accurate, and the make-up symmetrical and satisfactory to the critical eye of the printer and book fancier. Within its covers are more than three-score short poems which breathe the sentiment of the hills and highlands, the homely joys of the country homestead, and the peaceful beauty of sylvan scenes. The thought and the feeling of these simple poems do honor to the honest soul and noble heart of the author, the merchant-farmer "Bard of Quiet Dell."
