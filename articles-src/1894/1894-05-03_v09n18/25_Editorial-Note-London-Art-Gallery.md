On Sunday, April 22, for the first time in the city of London, a picture gallery was open for Sunday exhibition. There were so many desirous of avoiding themselves of the opportunity of viewing the pictures, that throughout the day long lines waited admission to the overcrowded hall. The Sunday opening of art galleries in London has been even more earnestly discussed than the Sunday opening of the Museum of Art in this city. The great success of this first opening, it is said, will insure its continuance, and cause other art galleries in London to open also on Sunday.
