The case of Edgar Price, a Seventh-day Adventist, of Millington, Md., who was on trial at Chestertown, for Sunday labor, has been dismissed by Judge Wickes on the ground that the case was not properly before the court. The judge took occasion, however, to uphold the constitutionality and propriety of the Sunday law.
