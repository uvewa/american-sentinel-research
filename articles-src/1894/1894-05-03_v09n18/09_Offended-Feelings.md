A Spanish correspondent reports that the Protestant churches in some of the provinces have been closed, and a church in Madrid has been required to close its front entrance, and use the side door, as the open doors on the street constituted an offense against the religious sentiments of the people.

Offended feelings have played a great part in the history of religious persecutions. It is human nature to take offense because some one has the temerity to differ from its opinions; and because the great majority of men in all ages have clung to the natural disposition, religious history—Catholic and Protestant alike—has to record manifestations of intolerance in every chapter.

In an old volume, published about a century ago, Rev. John MacGowan, of London, gave some of the shifting scenes in modern Church history. In answer to the question, "Has any sect besides the papists been found to persecute those who differed from them?" he says:

Yes, every sect who has, at any time been happy enough to grasp the reins of government for the time being. The worthy papists bore the facts of orthodoxy for the space of twelve hundred and sixty years, during which time much blood was shed by open massacres, secret assassinations, pretended judiciaries, acts of bloody faith; and at last to finish the bloody reign of antichrist, England, France, the Netherlands, and the valleys of Piedmont swam with the gore of such who would believe the Bible sooner than the voice of the priests. Queen Mary's reign furnished the orthodoxy in her day, with a fine opportunity of discovering their soul for the Church, by murdering those who believed and obeyed the Bible; but her reign being short, and Elizabeth ascending the throne upon her demise, the other scale rose uppermost, and the Protestants, in their turn, became orthodoxy, i.e., got the government into their hands.

Oh, the violence of reputed orthodoxy! Those same gentlemen were no sooner emerged from prison than they also let the world know that they were not to be differed from with impunity; that the formula of their faith and worship must be regarded with as implicit obedience as that in the former reign imposed by the papists. Now the Presbyterians, Independents, and other Congregationalists felt the weight of their rage, or, if you please, seal for orthodoxy and the good of the Church. Now the prison keepers and their friend, Master Ketch, had pretty near as good a run of trade as in the reign of Mary. And now the wilds of America began to be well peopled with English Protestants who oppressed dissenters; and the good Episcopalians at home kept the fleece to themselves and had all the good of the Church before them.

But those said Presbyterians and Independents had no sooner crossed the ocean for conscience' sake, and found themselves secure from Episcopalian rage, than they themselves commenced orthodoxy, and set up their own formula as the standard of religion, to which they required as implicit submission from others as the good bidinge of England had ere while done for themselves; and now the poor antipodo-Baptists and Quakers were taught, that a mittimus is a mittimus whether it is signed by a papist, an Episcopalian or a Presbyterian, and that sentence of death is to be dreaded as much from the mouth of the latter as of the former. Those same dissenters who had so lately found Old England too hot for themselves, by the glowings of priestly zeal for orthodoxy, soon made New England too hot for the poor Quakers and antipodo-Baptists; who, to escape the rage for presbytery, fled, the one to Pennsylvania and the other to Rhode Island, that they might not be compelled to worship God according to other people's consciences and contrary to their own.

This is human nature, and a sorry picture it makes. Yet nowadays we hear about offenses against religious sentiment even in professedly Protestant circles. The tendency toward regulating people's conduct by law in religious observances is increasingly manifest. It is now urged that men must be made to respect Sunday, just as it was formerly thought that respect for the communion or baptism must be enforced.

Religious sentiment may be offended and provoked to retaliation, but Christian sentiment never. Can we imagine such a thing of the Saviour, as that he should become offended and make somebody feel the penalty of differing from him? He was meek, gentle, long-suffering. He gave his back to the smitters, and his cheeks to them that plucked off the hair; nor did he hide his face from shame and spitting. This is the spirit which is given to those who will let the human nature die, and become partakers of the divine nature. This is Christianity. Is it not time for Christians to follow Christ?—*Present Truth, London, Eng.*
