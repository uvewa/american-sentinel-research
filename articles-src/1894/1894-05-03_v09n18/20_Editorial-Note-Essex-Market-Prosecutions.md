MONDAY, April 16, the Essex Market Police Court was again the scene of attempted wholesale Sunday prosecution. The World notes it among its news items thus:—

Fifty small storekeepers on the East Side were arraigned in Essex Market Court yesterday, for violation of the Sunday law, in selling goods on Sunday. The defendants claimed that they observed their own Sabbath on Saturdays. They denounced their arrest as an outrage. Many had been unable to furnish bail and had passed the night in Eldridge Street station. The arrests were made by policemen under Captain Cortright. Justice Hogan held about twenty and discharged the others.

There is a grim humor in the inconsistency of the police department attempting to make up for its lapses in official duty, and failures to clear out centers of actual criminality within speaking distance of the doors of its own station houses, by zealous attention to an unconstitutional statute, the enforcement of which is religious persecution.
