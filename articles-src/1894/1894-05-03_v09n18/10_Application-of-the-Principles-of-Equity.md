In favor of the exemption of churches from taxation, a favorite argument urged is that the edifice and property are sacred and hence beyond the reach of ordinary claims on individuals or corporate bodies. The error arises from the confusion of two ideas which should always be kept separate and distinct, viz: the Church as a divine institution, a religious cult, and the church as a number of individuals united in opinion and brought together either for worship or the inculcation of certain doctrines. Upon the former the State can have no power, for it is established in the heart and soul of man, and has neither habitation nor outward visible form. It is a spiritual principle and can no more be taxed than can air, light, the odor of flowers, or the singing of birds.

But the individuals, under whatever name known, who occupy property or buildings for worship or for the spread of their religious opinions are amenable to all the claims, dues and penalties exacted from any other body. When a church is weak in numbers and cannot afford to erect a house of worship no one dreams of opposing the just payment of rent for a suitable place of meeting. When an evangelist holds religious services in a public hall, who would ask that he be given the privilege of rent free? When that weak congregation has increased in numbers, or this evangelist has secured a sufficient following, and a church building is required, a site is solicited and paid for, the edifice is erected and also paid for. The lot was taxed when in possession of its former owner, but lo, when the building is opened for worship by a number of such individuals, the taxes cease, and have to be paid by the remaining portion of the community. Now, by what chain of reason can such a system be justified? The building is admittedly set apart for sacred purposes, but it is for the convenience, not of God, who dwells not in temples made by hands, but of a class of the community who have sufficient money to pay for the luxury of meeting within a building, rather than in the open fields. The members do not cease to be citizens by becoming worshipers, and do not leave their duties as such behind them at the church door. That lot and that building are owned by individual men and women, and hence liable to the taxes due from any other similar lot or building. Let any one attempt to interfere with these vested rights and he will soon learn that such is also the view of those who now set up a fraudulent claim to exemption.

Again, this building and property is used for concerts, lectures and bazaars to make money, not for the community that grants the exemption, but for the sake of those who use the particular building, for payment of the pastor's salary, the expenses of heating, lighting, etc., the furnishing of more elegant carpets or upholstery, a new organ or other articles of pleasure or luxury.

By all means, religion should be free, untrammeled and untaxed, but not the structures that men rear for the gratification of their taste, for comfort or individual opinion. In this advocacy we have not in mind any sect or denomination, but hold the principle universally true, from the humble "upper room" of the brethren to the lofty and imposing cathedral. . . .

One often reads of the wealth of this or that church; what does this mean? Why simply that a number of wealthy individuals compose its membership and give liberally of their means for its maintenance. They also contribute liberally to their political club or party, to musical and other societies. Why are the latter contributions, or the investment of them, subject to taxation and the former not?

The fact of a custom being ancient is no proof that the custom is right, in fact all history is but a protest and struggle against hoary custom, and in proportion as a nation throws off the incubus of custom, merely as such, does it progress. Radicalism usually consists in viewing an old truth from a new standpoint. The view that exemption from taxation is unjust, is but the application of the ordinary principles of equity, and such a broadening of the horizon as to include within its sweep more than had formerly been the case.—American Standard.
