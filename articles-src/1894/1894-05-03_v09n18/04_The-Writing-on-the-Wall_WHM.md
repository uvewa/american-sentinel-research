The foreign correspondent of the New York Observer, after speaking of a company of six hundred Russian convicts destined for Siberia, says:—

But far sadder bands of prisoners than these exist in Russia. I allude to the wretched thundists and Baptists who are in jail for the sake of their religion, and who are sent in larger or smaller detachments, and in company with ordinary criminals, either to remote districts of transconcesia or to Siberia, there to explain their burrey. Considerably over a hundred of these faithful people, poor peasants, with a mighty empire handed against them, are in prison as I write, on charges of a most trumpery description. Most of them are not even charged with any misdemeanor; they are in prison because they are suspected, or because some priest or policeman has reported against them. And without trial of any sort, and at the bare word of the governors of the provinces, their homes will be broken up, their children taken from them, and they themselves transported for a term of five or six years to one of the most inhospitable regions of the whole empire. I often wonder how long this state of affairs is to continue. It still continues and in as marked a manner as ever, notwithstanding the protests of Europe and America, notwithstanding the exposure made of perhaps the most iniquitous persecution since the Middle Ages.

Is it remarkable that Russia should fail to be moved by the protests of Europe and America? What right has either Europe or America to protest? Have they yet plucked the motes from their own eyes? Indeed they have not. Let that country cast the first stone at Russia, which has no union of Church and State,—no religious laws, and no enforcement of religious forms by legal enactment. They may all look in fear at the writing in the sand, knowing well that it will soon be the writing on the wall.
