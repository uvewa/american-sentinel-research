A WRITER in the Central City Democrat, speaking of the election next Tuesday from a Christian and temperance standpoint, admonishes the "Christian voters" that Jesus Christ will sit over against the ballot box and see all that is put therein. . . . "Christian voters!" Why make this distinction? Are "Christian voters" any better than any other voters? We hear some people railing against Church and State, but they never see anything out of the way in such talks as that of this correspondent. They never can see any Church and State unless there is a cruntly, a cowl, or something of that sort in it. But they should be able to see that all this raising of such distinctions, all this urging that religionists should vote in a particular way because they are religionists, is contrary to the spirit of the Constitution and the teachings of the fathers. Having said to a man that he should vote this way or that because he is a Christian, how natural and easy it would be to take the next step and tell him that he should not vote for a certain candidate because that candidate was not a Christian, and then we should have practically the setting up of a religious text for office, which is contrary to the plain letter of the Constitution. Unless we desire and mean revolution, the only safe way and the only right way is to keep religious issues entirely out of politics.

A man may have as much religion as he pleases in his own personal politics, that is his own private matter, but let him not attempt to inject any of his religion into the politics of others.—Silver Creek Times.
