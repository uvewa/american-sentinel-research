A SEMI-WEEKLY paper, called The Bugle Horn, published at Salamanca, New York, notices an address, delivered in the town hall of Salamanca, by a Seventh-day Adventist minister, and makes this editorial comment:—

If the Seventh-day Adventists were as strong in America to-day as Romanism, there would be more oppression and more overthrow of law than there is under present conditions. At least they wish to have everything their own way now, and they are a small people numerically.

At the National Reform Convention held at College Springs, Iowa, March 13 and 14, a speaker Rev. T. P. Robb, of Linton, Iowa, is reported as saying of Seventh-day Adventists:—

They are entirely dependent upon their almanac; for their Sabbath begins exactly at six o'clock.

Adventists were the loudest clamorers for Sunday opening of the World's Fair. In most respects they are honest, conscientious, law-abiding citizens, but they are doing all in their power to break down our Sabbath and institute theirs.

Does not this man know the difference between the Bible and the almanac? Does he not know what the biblical division of time is,—has he not read, "And the evening and the morning were the first day?" Does he not know that Seventh-day Adventists have no more need of an almanac to remind them of the approach of the Sabbath than did Adam and Eve? If this man does not know that, according to the natural order established at creation, the day begins at sunset and ends at the following sunset, he would do well to read the first few verses of the first chapter of Genesis,—and if he does not know, that, following this division of time, Seventh-day Adventists observe the Sabbath from the setting of the sun to the setting sun, he would do well to become acquainted with and observe their practice before speaking with such assurance.

That "Seventh-day Adventists were the loudest clamorers for Sunday opening of the World's Fair," is another misstatement, as marked and inexcusable as the previous. It shows that this man presumes to publicly judge a people and define to the world their positions without having taken the least trouble to inform himself what their positions are. That is, he sets up a man of straw, gives it a bad name, attaching to that the title Seventh-day Adventist, and then takes great credit to himself for publicly knocking it down. Every man who is sufficiently well informed on these matters to warrant his expressing himself, even in private conversation, knows that no one who intelligently opposes legislation upon religious subjects and legal compulsion in the observance of religious forms, ever clamored for Sunday opening of the World's Fair. There is a vast difference between the attitude of those who strove to close the World's Fair on Sunday by congressional enactment, by statute, by the policeman's club, and were even anxious to invoke the bayonet,—and the position of those who declare that none of these have any authority in the matter, either to open or close, but that it was a matter of individual responsibility to God, whether as an exhibitor, each should close his exhibit or open it, whether he should work, or rest, or play, or worship, and that in this nothing could rightfully govern but each man's own personal free will.

Mr. Robb continues his strange misrepresentation by saying, "they are doing all in their power to break down our Sabbath and institute theirs. What does Mr. Robb mean by saying such a thing as this? Mr. Robb may claim Sunday as his Sabbath if he choose,—it certainly is not God's Sabbath. Seventh-day Adventists do not claim that the seventh day is their Sabbath,—their claim is that the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord, in consonance with the words of the commandment; and they are not "doing all in their power to institute theirs." They observe the Lord's Sabbath instituted by him at creation and needing not to be instituted or even defended by any man,—only obeyed.

The seventh day is not the Sabbath of the Seventh-day Adventists, but the Sabbath of the Lord,—they did not institute it and do not strive to institute it,—they only obey and go forth to preach the gospel to all the world. If Sunday, the first day of the week, is Mr. Robb's Sabbath, no man has any authority to deprive him of his choice, his only contest is with the God who says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God."

The same spirit which influences the Iowa minister animates the editor of the Bugle Horn, and his misconceptions and misrepresentations are similar. If his supposition were realized, and were correct, that "the Seventh-day Adventists were as strong in America to-day as Romanism" and from them there should result "more oppression and more overthrow of law than there is under present conditions," that would simply prove that they had forsaken the principles of the gospel which they now preach, and were no longer filled with the love of God and man which they now advocate.

No better thing could be done for the spiritual well-being of the editor of the Bugle Horn than to give him a commission to search throughout the world for one Seventh-day Adventist whom his description will cover. He would learn, as they have learned, not to wish to have everything his way, but God's own way. He would learn, as they have, that to love God, and one's neighbor as oneself, is not to usurp the prerogatives of God and assume to control the religious life of one's neighbor,—but that love of God is shown by glad obedience, in all simplicity, to his word; and love to man by doing unto others as we would be done by, and defending and protecting the rights of others as we would that they should defend and protect ours.
