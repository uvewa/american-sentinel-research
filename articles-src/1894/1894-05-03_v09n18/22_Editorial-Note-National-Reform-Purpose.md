At a National Reform convention held at College Springs, Iowa, during March, Wm. Weir, a district secretary of the National Reform Association, said:—

National Reform means a nation, with all its laws and customs, kneeling at the feet of Jesus, and no person eligible to any office of trust unless he be a Christian, by profession at least. A large majority of the people are Christians, and they should let the politicians know what is wanted of them.

This is an ingenuous statement of the purpose of the National Reformers,—to establish a religious test for all offices in the gift of the people or the Government. It is their unmistakable intention to abrogate completely those principles of the Constitution which have been the distinctive safeguards of the people of this country.
