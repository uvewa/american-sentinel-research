The Christian Statesman, of April 21, has a three-column editorial on the "Political Aspect of the Roman Catholic Problem," of which the following is one paragraph:—

Here is a man who says, "I am the representative of the Almighty God in the world, and claim whatever of authority God claims." The American Government disputes that claim, and refuses to recognize his authority. Then the pope must either withdraw his claim, and thereby confess himself a pretender, and so relinquish control of all who have recognized him, or contest it with this Government. The only reason he does not wage a more open warfare with us, and issue his bulks of deposition and anathema against our authorities, is because he thinks the plan he is following is the better one for the attainment of his code—the subjection of the nation to his authority. He does claim the authority to release every Roman Catholic in this country from his allegiance to this Government. That follows of necessity from his claim as the representative of God in the world. He can do anything God can do. This brings to view the utter antagonism between the papal theory of human government and the Protestant theory. It is the old controversy as to the "divine right of kings," with the assumption on the part of the antagonist that the pope of Rome is the king. This doctrine is destructive, of course of human liberty as we understand human liberty. The Romanist may tell us that we would be a great deal better off if we accepted his doctrine and submitted to his "sovereign," but that is the point of controversy. He may tell us that our ideas of human liberty are all at fault, and are subversive of the rights of the church, the rights of the individual, the rights of God himself; but that is the question. We agree with him, however, that they differ radically from the doctrines of his church, and if he is right we are at war with the Almighty.

It is interesting to see in this the misconception of the subject to which the views, which the Christian Statesman defends, necessarily lead it, and how, in following up the question, and expressing the reasons for its antagonism of Roman Catholicism, it necessarily refutes all its own positions as to the relations between civil government and religion.

In the first place the Statesman is in error when it assumes that, properly, the American Government disputes the claim of the pope that he is the representative of Almighty God in the world. The American Government cannot rightfully take any cognizance whatever of any such claim. Neither can this Government enter into an investigation as to whether certain of its citizens recognize the pope as their religious head and the vicegerent of God, and predicate from that their transonable attitude towards governmental authority. If those who have acknowledged the pope's claim of divine authority should be found levying war against the United States, and adhering to its enemies and giving them aid and comfort, and should confess to this in open court, or the overt act be proved against them by the testimony of two witnesses, then this Government could deal with them individually. For the United States, in its governmental capacity, to give any such recognition to the claim of the pope to infallibility and to a divine right to rule the world, as would be involved in disputing it, would be to assert the same claims for itself over its own citizens;—whereas the decision as to the infallibility of the pope and the propriety of his claims to divine right rests with each individual. There is no difference in principle between the assertion of divine right to rule by a pope, a king, or a congress. The Statesman properly denies the divine right of the pope or of kings, and declares that doctrine to be contrary to the theory of Protestantism and destructive of human liberty. In saying this the Statesman is expressing a truth. But in denying the propriety of the claim of the pope and refusing to acknowledge the divine right of kings, the Statesman leaves no foundation whatever for the doctrines which are the sole reason for its existence. If there is no divine right of kings and they cannot speak as by the mouth of God, neither can congresses or legislatures voice the commands of God, interpret his word, and enforce formal obedience to their interpretation of his laws. If this is so, there is no further reason for the publication of the Christian Statesman.

The truth is, that all enforcement of religion by law is papal in its character. It is impossible to uphold the legal enforcement of religion without logically upholding the papacy. It is impossible to antagonize the papacy without logically antagonizing all coalition of religion with the State, and opposing every religious statute and ordinance. W. H. M.
