The religious press gives continual evidence of the development of the principles of Spiritualism in the popular churches. In addition to the unconscious Spiritualism with which all so-called orthodoxy is permeated, there is a growing element within the churches which they themselves recognize as Spiritualistic. This is in the line of the progress of the fulfillment of prophecy. Spiritualism will be one of the chief factors in the last great deceptions.
