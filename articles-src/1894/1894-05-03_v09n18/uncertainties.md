## OCR Corrections Made

### Page 1
- "CALPIN F. BOLLHAN" → likely "CALVIN P. BOLLMAN" (known associate editor)
- "WILLIAM H. QUARR" → likely "WILLIAM H. McKEE" (known associate editor)
- "BORN STREET" → likely "BOND STREET" (known publication address)

### Page 3
- "Rom. 31:1" → should be "Rom. 13:1" (clear biblical reference error)

### Page 4
- "Yerba Journal" → context suggests "Yreka Journal" (California newspaper)

### Page 6
- Multiple OCR errors in quoted text (e.g., "thundists" should be "Stundists", "transconcesia" unclear, "burrey" unclear)
- These appear in quoted material from New York Observer and are transcribed as they appear in the OCR

### Page 7
- "cruntly" → unclear word in quoted text from Silver Creek Times

### Page 8
- Subscription table has formatting issues but prices are illegible in OCR
- "slumbrode" → likely "slumbering" but transcribed as appears in OCR
