THE Open Court says:—

An edict of universal tolerance would hardly terminate the heretic-hunts of the Russian Empire; and though the Constitution of the United States protects the religious privileges of our Jewish fellow-citizens, their main guarantee of freedom is, after all, the superior general intelligence of the American public.

It is true that ignorance and bigotry have been contemporary, and from that the inference is drawn that only in periods of intellectual darkness can there be religious persecution, but the time is close at hand when it will be shown that "superior general intelligence" is not a trustworthy guarantee of freedom. It is the misdirected "intelligence" of this country which is laying deep and sure the foundations for religious persecution, which is now beginning in several States of the Union.
