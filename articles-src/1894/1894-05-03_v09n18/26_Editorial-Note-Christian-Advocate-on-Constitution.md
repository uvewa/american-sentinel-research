THE Boston Advertiser quotes the New York Christian Advocate as saying, "To introduce the name of 'Jesus Christ our Lord' into the Constitution of the country would be a step towards the union of Church and State, which, so long as we wish liberty of conscience, we can never advocate. An agitation such as this can simply arouse opposition where it is now slumbrode, and lead to the unrestrained utterance of sentiments provocative of irreverence and irreligion."
