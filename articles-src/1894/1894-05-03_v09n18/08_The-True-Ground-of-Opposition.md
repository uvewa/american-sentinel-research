We are prepared to believe that the record of popery, both in the remote and immediate past, is such as to warrant the belief that it has not given up the design of subjecting the governments of the earth to the triple crowned head of the Catholic Church. It is moreover apparent from the special favors extended to the French Republic, the unusual grace bestowed by the pope upon our great national enterprise, the World's Fair, and the specially friendly tone in which he has spoken of all republics, both by himself and through his delegates for several years last past, that his hope, desire and design are to secure a nucleus for gathering temporal power in some republican land. But though we are thus persuaded of his deliberate purpose, we do not by any means look with favor upon an organized effort to destroy the Catholic Church, or deny them the privileges we claim for ourselves.

The true ground of opposition to the claims of temporal sovereignty and papal infallibility, is the genuine and broad liberality embraced in the Golden Rule. One kind of threatened bondage cannot be successfully averted, by accepting and placing ourselves in the power of another kind of bondage. It has been said, as the result of years of judicial experience, that hard cases make bad precedents; and hence we should not seek to bond the general principles of freedom and open, manly warfare, to make them fit to our notions of the papal case. Apply to it what we apply to all other cases of kindred character, and there stand until the battle for freedom and right has ended in the consummation devoutly to be wished—the disenthrallment of the world.

Whenever people find it necessary to band together in the dark to accomplish their purposes, and considerable numbers of our citizens are found thus banded together, the times are rite with danger; and the more the disposition to thus secretly and darkly work becomes apparent, the more should those who love light get right out into its full blaze, and refuse to be compromised, hampered, corrupted, or misled by any methods, organizations, petty plans, or influences, which do not love the light, and do not seek open and manly encounters, in the presence and knowledge of the world.

Herein are safety and consistency to be found.—*The Patriot*, April 12, 1894.
