SHOULD we obey all laws of the Government implicitly without questioning their rightfulness?

Every civil law that does not conflict with God's law should be obeyed. When a State or nation enjoins through its laws a religious duty, whether that duty be scriptural or anti-scriptural, it is not to be regarded one whit more because enacted by civil authority. Any man that obeys a religious law because enforced by the Government, pays undue homage to the law-enacting authorities. Any religious duty commanded by God through the Scriptures is paramount to all other commands and ought to be so treated by every man. When this is done direct honor is paid to God; the individual is connected with him by faith, and acceptable obedience rendered.

The Bible does not command one thing, which, if obeyed to the fullest extent, would be the least infringement upon any one's rights. Civil authority, then, has no just claim for prohibiting the full exercise of any religious duty enjoined by the Scriptures. Now the sacred Word imperatively commands, under pain of eternal death, the observance of the seventh day of the week. The same command also enjoins that we labor upon the first day of the week. If this is obeyed it cannot possibly be an infringement upon the rights of any, provided the seventh-day observer does his work upon the first day as commanded by God. A law that interferes with a man's convictions respecting the observance or non-observance of any day is an unrighteous law, and no man is under any obligations to respect or obey it in any way. No government can reward its subjects for outward Sabbath observance, neither has it any right to punish them for disregarding the day.

Those who have been so clamorous for Sunday observance, when confronted with the definite seventh day, have repeatedly said that all God required was a seventh part of the time, leaving the individual to choose the day to be observed. But whenever the Sunday law has been enforced this seventh part of the time theory has not stood the test. In Georgia, Tennessee, and Maryland men who conscientiously rested upon the seventh day were arrested and committed to prison for quietly laboring on their own premises on Sunday. They had observed one-seventh part of the time, and the very seventh part that God sanctified and commanded to be observed. But this would not do. They were told that the seventh day people could keep the Sabbath if they chose, but they must not work on Sunday. Thus a two-sevenths part of the time theory was brought into practice, and required of those who keep the Sabbath of the Lord; one-seventh to satisfy the conscience of the Sabbath observer, and one-seventh to satisfy the conscience of his Sunday-keeping neighbor. How unjust! How these indefinite time observers stultify themselves when their theory is reduced to practice. The day is declared to be indefinite when commanded by God's law, but made definite when commanded by man's law. What an insult to the God of heaven!

But Rom. 31:1, "Let every soul be subject to the higher powers . . . the powers that be are ordained of God," is urged to prove that all governmental laws, whether civil or religious, should be obeyed. Let us see if this has always worked well. All will admit that Christ the Creator of all things ordained the powers that be; and yet it is plainly recorded in Acts 4:26 that the powers that he ordained stood up against him. The passage reads, "The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ." Were the governments of earth acting within the sphere that God ordained them to act when they stood up against him? or had they overreached the limits of their governmental jurisdiction? It is very evident that they surpassed their limit.

That governments ordained of God have frequently overreached their proper limits can easily be demonstrated from both history and the Scriptures. For want of space but one instance will be cited and that from the Bible. It is found in the book of Acts. It appears that Peter and John had healed a cripple in the name of Jesus of Nazareth, which caused great excitement among the rulers, etc. The magistrates were influenced by the ministers of those times to apprehend and imprison the apostles. When brought before the civil authorities (the power ordained of God) they received the following command, "And they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus." Acts 4:18. Peter and John paid no attention to this command of the magistrates, but continued to speak and heal in a much more powerful manner. With rage the civil authorities remanded them to prison, determined that their mandate to speak no more in Jesus' name should be obeyed. But God was determined that it should not be. He sent his angel to instruct the apostles not to obey the magistrates. "But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said, Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life." Acts 5:19, 20. Civil government told them not to speak, God told them to speak.

"We ought to obey God rather than men," said Peter, and so they did.

The above citation is sufficient to show that when any government enacts laws contrary to the Word of God, that it is not only the privilege of the people to disobey, but it is the duty of all to disobey. What God's Word requires of one man is required of every man. God instituted the seventh-day Sabbath in Eden, enjoined it from Sinai with a voice that shook the earth, and it was reiterated by Christ in his sermon on the mount, when he indorsed the law commanding the day, in the words, "Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." Matt. 5:18.

Now when State or national government enacts a law that we shall observe Sunday, the very day God began his work of creation and commands us to labor thereon, should we obey God or men? Would it not be following apostolic example to preach and teach against such a usurpation of divine privilege upon the part of any civil government? There is no reason why all Sunday laws which are so diametrically opposed to divine command should not be treated the same as Peter and John treated the decree of the magistrates not to speak or teach in the name of Jesus—openly disregard them. By disobeying all laws which conflict with the law of God, we make ourselves subject to the higher powers—the Government of heaven.
