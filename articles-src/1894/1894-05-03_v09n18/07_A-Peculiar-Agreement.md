# Agreement.

TO BE PLACED IN THE HANDS OF A. B. CARLOCK, FORT JONES, CALIFORNIA.

We, the undersigned, firms and individuals, doing business in the towns of Fort Jones, Etna, Callahane, and the adjoining towns of Scott Valley, appreciating the fact that one day's rest should be accorded in each week to every one, and that the custom of doing business on Sunday is one that is far behind the times and should be abolished; that the closing of our respective places of business on Sundays will not be any detriment to our patrons or ourselves, have hereby entered into the following agreement, to wit:

1st. To not sell any goods on Sundays after Sunday, May 13, 1894, except in case of sickness, death, accident, or some unforeseen circumstance, when it would become an actual necessity, or a case of urgency, where it would be inflicting a wrong to refuse.

2nd. That if the above agreement is broken by either of the parties whose names are hereto attached, said party or parties agree to pay into the hands of A. B. Carlock, Fort Jones, the sum of one hundred dollars as a fine or penalty for such violation of this agreement; the party accused of such violation to have, if requested by him, a hearing before three of the parties whose names are subscribed to this instrument—one from each of the three above-mentioned towns, to be appointed by Mr. A. B. Carlock, said hearing to be held in the town where the accused does business, at a time to be agreed on between the accused and the committee appointed for said hearing; the decision of this committee to be final and binding on the accused party.

3rd. That any party to this agreement can cancel his connection thereto by notifying every party to same in writing or by publication in the Vesta Journal, said cancellation not to take effect less than thirty days after date of said written notice or publication. The violation of said agreement before the expiration of the said thirty days to be subject to penalty or fine as above described.

4th. This agreement to be in force from the 13th day of May, for the term of one year.

5th. That all parties signing this agreement shall immediately after signing same give proper notice to their patrons and the public that this agreement has been entered into.

6th. That at any time during the term of this agreement above stated (one year), if two-thirds of the firms or individuals signing this article agree at a meeting to be called at two weeks' notice in writing from any firm or individual whose name is hereto attached, each firm to be represented by one person only, shall vote that this agreement come to an end in not less than sixty days from date of such meeting, then this agreement shall be null and void.

The meeting thus called to be held at the town of Etna, it being the most central point.

7th. This agreement not to be binding until signed by all of the following firms and individuals: Alex, Parker & Sons, George Buchner, Joseph Stephens, and E. Miller, of Etna; J. Camp & Co., H. J. Diggles, J. W. Wheeler, and E. F. Reichman & Co., Fort Jones; Denny Bar & Co., Callahan; John Quigley, Oro Fino.

8th. That this agreement be presented to all persons doing business in the towns above described, and their signatures solicited, also for all adjoining towns and their cooperation also solicited.

9th. That if any penalties are imposed according to this agreement, said money shall be used for some public benefit to be determined on by at least a four-fifths vote of all the parties to this agreement, one vote for each party.

10th. That a copy of this agreement be published in the *Yerba Journal* and *Scott Valley News*, and that pay for same be made by an equal assessment on all parties hereto subscribed, and that each one agrees to pay his share of same.

Where there is no boycotting or combining to force others out of business because they themselves do not desire to do business, there can, of course, be no valid objection to such a mutual understanding, provided individual business men or firms see fit to agree among themselves regarding the closing of their stores or shops on Sunday or any other day. This agreement is reprinted as an example of a remarkable development of the spirit of organized Sunday observance in a State which has no Sunday laws.
