Rev. T. P. Robb, of Linton, Iowa, is reported to have said at a National Reform convention, in Iowa, in March:—

This nation has no Sabbath. It tried to purchase one, but failed. Congress paid $2,500,000 to procure it during the Fair, but was cheated out of it by a vile plot,—an underhanded game; and, notwithstanding all this iniquitous work to procure the appropriation, and the proceeds of the Fair on Sunday too, many Christians attended who had voted for Sunday closing. Adventists were the loudest clamorers for Sunday opening. In most respects they are honest, conscientious, law-abiding citizens, but they are doing all in their power to break down our Sabbath and institute theirs.

This is a peculiar mixture of frank acknowledgment of the mercenary methods used to secure a national recognition of Sunday observance, and a consequent union of religion and the State, and a veiled misrepresentation, perhaps through ignorance, of those who opposed Congress so committing itself, or making any such wicked bargain. As Rev. Mr. Robb so aptly puts it, Congress did try "to purchase" the observance of Sunday by the World's Fair and the representatives of all the earth there present, but he is utterly in error when he says that Adventists were "clamorers for Sunday opening." The position of Seventh-day Adventists—as of all who oppose religious legislation on correct principles and from proper motives, is strictly and invariably negative;—that neither Congress, nor any other civil authority, has any right to decree either one way or the other in any religious question. In religion human law must be neutral. For man to attempt to enforce religion is blasphemy towards God, and unfallingly works iniquitous hardship upon men.
