THE Mail and Express says editorially:

All citizens, irrespective of religious convictions and sectarian affiliations, must be required to pay their full share of public school taxation. If any citizen prefers to send his children to private or church schools, he has a perfect right so to do, but the extra expense incident to such a choice must not be made the ground of a protest against the so-called "injustice of double taxation." He is simply paying for a luxury that he thinks he can afford. The State has no right to pay for the gratification of his personal preferences as between schools, much less for the indulgence of his personal prejudices on the score of sect or creed.

It is a great and unexpected satisfaction to be able to quote approvingly from the Mail and Express. In this and the defection from the Sabbath Union doctrine shown in its prohibition editorial, of April 9, there is enough leaven of truth and sound doctrine to yet leaven the whole lump, if it only be allowed to work.
