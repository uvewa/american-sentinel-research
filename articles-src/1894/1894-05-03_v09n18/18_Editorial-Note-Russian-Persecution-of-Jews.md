The spirit which animates the Russian persecution of the Jews is very clearly evidenced by the words of a Russian paper when it says: "No restrictions of the Jews' civil rights can outweigh the scandal of their religious privileges." That is the same feeling which can be looked for in this country when mistaken religious zealotry shall have completed its work and left a free field for prejudice and bigotry to fulfill their mission.
