THERE promises to be an interesting fight over the election of a Regent of the University to succeed the late Bishop McNierny, of this city. Among the candidates are Rev. Mr. Malone, of Brooklyn; Bishop Gabriels, of Ogdensburg, and Bishop McQuade, of Rochester, all Roman Catholics. The argument is made that as the deceased regent was a Romanist his successor should be of that faith.

Rowland Blennerhassett Mahony, of Buffalo, ex-Minister to Ecuador, was here yesterday lobbying against the candidacy of Bishop McQuade. He is supposed to be representing Bishop Ryan, of the Buffalo diocese. Bishop McQuade is an enemy of the public school system, while Bishop Ryan stands for the liberal and Americanized element in the church. — Mail and Express, February 28.
