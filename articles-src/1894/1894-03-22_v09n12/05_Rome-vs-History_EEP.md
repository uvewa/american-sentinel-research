A VIGOROUS, and probably successful, protest has been filed with the Board of Education in San Francisco, against the use of "Myers' Outlines of Medieval and Modern History," as a text book in the high schools of that city. While the Catholics deny having anything to do with the filing of the protest, the history is objected to solely on the ground that it is extremely offensive to Catholics. No objection is made that the history is not a correct and truthful delineation of the events which actually transpired, but simply that the position which the Roman Church occupies is not pleasing to contemplate. Appeal is made to the fact that the book, in so far as it refers to the Catholic Church, comes within the purview of the State constitution, which provides that no sectarian book shall be used in the public schools. The author of the protest admits that it is impossible to give a complete history of those times without referring to the Roman Church, and displays extreme sensitiveness that nothing but what is creditable to the Catholic Church be published. Any departure from this is looked upon as treading upon forbidden ground, and an infringement of rights. A comparison of the difference between countries in which the Roman Church for a long time has had full and undisputed sway, and those where the masses of the people have belonged to the Protestant persuasion, is particularly objectionable. The statements in the book that "the church through popes and councils, had committed itself to the doctrine that the earth is flat and denounced as irreverent and heretical any view differing from this," are branded as "flat-footed falsehoods."

The whole book is characterized as a skillful attempt to prejudice the minds of the young against Catholicism, and, in the words of the protest, "is in reality adapted for a fifth rate Protestant college, or an anti-popery Sunday school."

About six years ago the use of "Swinton's History" was so violently opposed by the Catholic clergy for similar reasons, that its use in the schools was discontinued.

E. E. PARLIN.
