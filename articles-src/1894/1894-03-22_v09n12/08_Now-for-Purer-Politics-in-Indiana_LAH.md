The Indianapolis News of March 8, gives an account of a religious movement, designed to influence political parties in the interests of moral reform, that has now reached that place. The movement comes from the young people's societies of the various churches, without regard to denomination. These include the Christian Endeavor Society, the Young People's Society, the Epworth League, the Baptist Young People's Union, and the St. Andrew's Brotherhood. These societies, massed together, are called the Christian Alliance. It is stated that a chief object of this alliance is to influence political nominating conventions and that it will endeavor to make itself felt before the time set for the State convention to be held in Indianapolis. Arrangements have been made to have a mass meeting with revival services, to be held for a week just before the political conventions. All the churches in the city will be asked to help support the movement.

The Christian Endeavor Society has circulated a paper which is called a roll of honor, and to which it gets all the signers possible. The pledge is as follows:—

Trusting in the Lord Jesus Christ for direction, we promise him that we will never indulge in any intoxicants or tobacco, nor use profane or impure language, nor violate the obligations of social purity or the Sabbath; and when we vote it shall be as we think Christ would have us vote; and we will pray each day for God to help us to keep this pledge, and that the saloon, gambling room, and other places of evil resort shall be banished from the land.

It is stated that this pledge and the work is undenominational and that "the Knights of Father Matthew of the Catholic Church, and other organizations interested in good citizenship, will meet together and act in unity." The largest hall in the city has been rented and a mass meeting will be held, lasting from April 15 to the 21st, which is just a few days before the Republican convention to be held there. On the Sunday evening that the revival opens, all the churches in the city will be asked to dispense with their regular services, so that the congregations may attend the mass meeting. The News states that "it is probable that the alliance will make some definite expression concerning political conventions, and warning them that they cannot expect the support of the alliance unless certain demands of good citizenship are complied with."

There are persons in Indianapolis who cannot give their support to this movement, and cannot sign the "roll of honor," who will very likely be accused of not being "interested in good citizenship" when they do not join in this movement.

This movement is much the same as that going on in other States, as, for example, where the Young People's Christian Endeavor Society in Illinois has entered politics, one of its chief objects being the "preservation of the American Sabbath" by that means.

These young people's endeavors to Christianize society will fall quite short of their aims as long as their weapons are those of the world, such as cooperation with or threats against scheming politicians who will or will not yield to their demands.

It is quite significant to see what means have to be adopted to secure the "preservation of the American Sabbath." Surely a thing that has never been sound enough to stand alone would need a pretty strong preservative with which to preserve it.
