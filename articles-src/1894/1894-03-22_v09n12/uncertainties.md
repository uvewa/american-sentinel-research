# Uncertainties Log — v09n12 (1894-03-22)

## Page 1, Line 31
- **Transcribed as:** "LAWYN P. BOLLMAN"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** OCR reads "LAWYN" but this is likely "CALVIN P. BOLLMAN" (known associate editor). The first name appears damaged or poorly scanned. Common abbreviation is "C. P. Bollman" or "CPB."

## Page 3, Line 121
- **Transcribed as:** "MARCH 22, 1891"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Header date reads "1891" but this is clearly issue from 1894 (volume 9, number 12). Likely OCR error on page header. Context confirms 1894 is correct.

## Page 6, Line 353
- **Transcribed as:** "gorgonosty uniformed"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** "gorgonosty" is likely OCR error for "gorgeously" — Swiss guard uniforms are famously ornate.

## Page 7, Line 359
- **Transcribed as:** "MARCH 22, 1884"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Another header date error — reads "1884" but should be "1894" based on volume/issue number.
