"Spiritualism," says the Catholic Review, "is rapidly developing into a recognized religion and will shortly put on all the trappings of separate congregations. In Baltimore, Mrs. Rachel Wolcott has been installed as pastor of the First Spiritualistic Church of that city, and has already a fairly large body of parishioners. Indeed, that devilish deceit is making progress in the Monumental City and has led astray a number of persons who ought to be well-instructed Catholics. They have been misled by the genuine revelations made at seances to take the fallen angels for what they claimed to be—the spirits of the dead—and once admit that they are what they claim and that they are trustworthy in their statements and the end is abandonment of Christianity, the denial of the divinity of Christ, rejection of belief in the orthodox heaven and hell, and the acceptance of all the invention of those children of the father of lies."

Spiritualism is certainly all that the Catholic Review claims that it is, namely, intercourse with fallen angels; but Rome has no right to take issue with Spiritualism. With her doctrine of natural, inherent immortality, conscious state of the dead, prayers to saints, patron saints, etc., how can Rome successfully meet Spiritualism? She cannot, and will ere-long practically unite with that delusion for the purpose of receiving from her "saints" confirmation of her unscriptural dogmas. Only those who believe as the Scriptures declare, "that the dead know not anything," can successfully withstand the assaults of this modern devil worship.
