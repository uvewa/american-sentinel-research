The Judiciary Committee of the Senate and House will not hear anything further upon the proposition to insert a religious amendment into the preamble of the Constitution, at present. It is understood, however, that no action will be taken without giving a full opportunity to those who oppose the amendment to state the grounds of their opposition before the committees.
