At the meeting of the Municipal Board of Education of the city of Pittsburg, Pa., March 13, the subject of the dress of the nuns who teach in the Riverside public school came up. After a short discussion the following was passed by a vote of twenty-nine to three:

Resolved, That the wearing by any of the teachers in the schools of this city during school hours in the school rooms of any garb or dress distinctive of and indicating any religious order, or any attachments or adornment on their person symbolic of any such order, or of any of the teachings of any particular religion or creed, is sectarian within the spirit and meaning of section 2, article 10, of the constitution of this State. viz: "No money raised for the support of the public schools in the commonwealth shall be appropriated to or used for the support of any sectarian school."

This action is right. The fact that an individual is a member of a religious order should not be a bar to becoming a teacher, but to permit the wearing, in public schools, of distinctive garbs and symbols, which have, and are designed to have, a distinctively religious and sectarian influence, is clearly contrary to the spirit of American institutions.
