It will be remembered that some months since, Chauncey M. Depew visited Rome and was accorded an audience by the pope. Mr. Depew seems to be very proud of his "gracious" reception by "his holiness," and has apparently improved every opportunity to tell of it. The most recent of these was an entertainment given Monday evening, March 12, by the Catholic Club of this city, at which Mr. Depew was not only an honored guest, but the principal orator. The Sun thus tells the story:—

Dr. Depew began speaking at 8:30 o'clock, and he kept his bearers laughing and applauding for two hours. On the platform where he stood sat Archbishop Satolli, Archbishop Corrigan, Bishop Gabriels of Ogdensburg, Vicar-General Mooney, John D. Crimmins, President Fornus of the club, Judge Daly, Judge O'Brien, Joseph Thoron, Mgr. Farley, and R. L. Hoguet. In the audience were almost all the pastors of the city.

Dr. Depew spoke mainly of his visit to Italy. He told of what he had seen of Rome, and he invoked the shade of Reedecker as he described the many monuments and churches. Then he told of Pompeii and of the home life of that town as he had seen it, and he rehearsed many Pompeian jokes, which the audience greeted heartily.

And when I got back to Rome," continued Dr. Depew, "I found that I had a strong desire to see the pope. I was told that this was impossible as the pope was a very busy man. A friendly bishop explained to me that delegations who came to Rome to see his holiness on important clerical matters frequently waited months before they could secure an audience. But I persisted and wrote a letter, which my friend, the bishop, said he would have delivered to the proper person. He added that I need not expect any answer, as private audiences had been discontinued. Two hours later, however, the bishop returned, saying that the pope would receive me the following day at noon.

"We arrived at the Vatican some time before the appointed hour, and as we ascended the many broad staircases of the palace we were saluted by the gorgonosty uniformed Swiss guard, and finally we were met by servants in crimson livery, who conducted no further. We passed through a number of audience chambers, and finally stopped in a room near where the pope would see me. A monsignor came out and talked with me. He was a young man who spoke several languages, and he was one of the most interesting men I ever met. Being an American and a Protestant I asked him what the ceremony would be when I entered the papal presence. He said that it was customary for the visitor to fall upon his knees and kiss the pope's ring and receive the papal blessing, but he added that he would find out how this would be in my case. He returned shortly and announced that the pope's desire was that the interview should be exactly as if I were being received by the President of the United States.

"I wondered how the pope knew what the ceremony of the White House was, as he had never been out of Rome, but in a few moments I was ushered in. His holiness arose and offered me his hand, then he told me to sit down, and sat down himself beside me. I was somewhat embarrassed as to what I should say, but I started in by thanking him for receiving me, and I told him how the many thousand men who are employed by the corporation I represented, two-thirds of whom were Catholics, would be pleased to hear of this audience on my return to America. This suggested the subject of capital and labor, and the pope started in to speak on that subject. It was the most eloquent speech I have ever heard. I would not do justice to it if I tried to repeat it to you. The soul of it was that all men should follow the Golden Rule, and remember that, being born of one Father, they must in the end stand before the same Father in judgment."

After the address supper was served to the distinguished guests in one of the dining rooms, and the other guests found seats in the many rooms of the club house and enjoyed cake and champagne.

It is not stated how many of the "pastors" of the city partook of the champagne, but the presence of so many "Protestant" ministers at such an entertainment is sufficiently significant in itself. It is certainly an omen of the fulfillment of that prophecy which says of the papal beast: "All that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world."
