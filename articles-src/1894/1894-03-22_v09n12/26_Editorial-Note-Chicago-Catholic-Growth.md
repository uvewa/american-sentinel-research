Regarding the progress of Roman Catholicism in the great metropolis of the central United States, Donahoe's Magazine says:—

Chicago's Catholic population comprised in 1833 only two hundred souls; to-day it is more than half a million. This phenomenal progress of Catholicity within such a comparatively short space of time is without parallel in the history of any church. . . . The onward march of the Catholic Church, within its limits, has been proportionately swifter and steadier than that of the city itself.

The boast contained in this last sentence is not without foundation; the same thing is as true of other growing centers of population in this country as it is of Chicago.
