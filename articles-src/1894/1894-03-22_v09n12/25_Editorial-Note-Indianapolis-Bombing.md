March 11, an attempt was made in Indianapolis, Ind., to blow up the office of the Ironclad Age, about the wickedest paper in the United States. The office is heated by natural gas, which was turned on and a single jet left burning so that an explosion must have occurred but for the timely arrival of the editor. It is to be regretted exceedingly that any one calling himself a Christian would imagine for a moment that there is any possible justification for such an act. The outrage was the conception of a dastard, not of a Christian.
