[This correct statement of the work and purposes of the political church is from the Truth Seeker. He words are true and they are none too earnest. Why should not one who sees unrighteousness so clearly be able eventually to fathom the mystery of righteousness?]

What is being done by the theocrats to push the Christian amendment? Meetings in furtherance of the movement have been held in a number of cities and towns, especially in Pennsylvania; at one meeting $225 was raised for the work in Washington, and $180 more for the same work was reported in one issue of the Christian Reformer, besides more than $400 for the general work of the National Reform Association; a mass meeting was held in Pittsburg on March 3rd, and it was expected that a large delegation would go to Washington from that meeting and be present as a moral backing at the hearing on the 6th inst. So many are going that special railway fares and hotel rates in Washington were secured; while the amendment is pending, a monthly, the Constitutional Amendment, will be issued and also a new weekly series of National Reform documents (the "Christian Amendment Series"); subscriptions are being solicited to send these documents to all the ministers and other influential persons throughout the Union; the association wishes to send out each week one hundred thousand copies of the smaller document and the same number each month of the larger one; petitions are being widely circulated; all friends of the treasonable scheme are urged to write letters to their representative and senators, and it is expected that hundreds of telegrams will be received by the members of the House Judiciary Committee from March 5th to 7th. These are some of the measures being taken to "arouse the public conscience" in order to intimidate Congress and so secure a favorable report from the Judiciary Committee. The enemy is splendidly organized, is under perfect discipline, is fanatically enthusiastic, and in the final struggle at the polls or elsewhere can depend upon the dormant yet powerful superstitions of millions of Christian men and women who may now think that they are opposed to the demands of the National Reform Association, but who will find it impossible to resist the Christian appeal to their early teachings and their fears—"He that is not for me is against me."

Now we know what is before us—a long and stubbornly contested fight to preserve the most important parts of the national Constitution and with them our dearest rights as American citizens and free students in the great world-school of thought. All that our ancestors wrested by the force of brain and the might of the strong right arm from noble and priest and king is at stake. The traitor political church has once more flung herself at the white throat of liberty. Her murderous hand must be wrenched away at whatever cost. She must be thrust back into her place and taught to respect the rights of the people. She says government is from God, by which euphemism she means herself. We say all just government is of the people, and when she attempts to usurp their authority she does so at her peril.
