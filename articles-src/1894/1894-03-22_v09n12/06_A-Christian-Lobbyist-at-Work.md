The real spirit of the promoters of the religious amendment is shown by the fact that they are endeavoring to prevent the committee from hearing the objections to the proposed amendment. The methods adopted are worthy of ward politicians, and yet they are unblushingly told in the Christian Reformer of March 3, by H. H. George, who is engineering the iniquitous business. Not having the paper of that date at hand, we borrow from an exchange a synopsis of Mr. George's boastful confession.

He begins his report of a day's labor with, "Well, I have gotten in some splendid work to-day." What this preacher calls "splendid" work an ordinary politician would designate wire-pulling, and the world would add that it was wire-pulling of the most unscrupulous sort. He says that he first met Judge Culberson, chairman of the House Committee on the Judiciary, who said he would do all he could to secure the Reformers a prompt and full meeting of the committee. Then he saw Representative Stone, of Pennsylvania, who "is most cordial and hearty, and says he will do everything he can to get the committee together, and will help us in every way he can." Mr. Stone is surprised that some members of the committee are opposed to the amendment; he does "not see how they can be, for it is right." Mr. Wolverton, of Pennsylvania, is seen; he is "quite as cordial and hearty," "will help all he can," and "volunteered to gather the committee."

Then Mr. George went over to the other end of the capitol. He saw Judge Pugh, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and found that gentleman "most cordial." Mr. George asked him if he would appoint his sub-committee for Wednesday. Why, certainly, he would, "glad to accommodate us." Rev. Mr. George continues his charmingly frank narrative. "And after a little very pleasant conversation, I said, 'Judge, would it be improper, as I am acquainted with Senator Wilson, of Iowa, to suggest that he be one of the sub-committee?'" Instead of telling the clerical lobbyist that such a request was highly improper, and that he could not for a moment think of packing the sub-committee in the interest of any combination, chairman Pugh responded with alacrity, "He shall be so appointed, at your request." We do not believe that Senator Pugh will thank Mr. George for telling the whole country about this little game. The most hardened Tammanyite would blush to make such a confession. Packing a jury is morally and legally a crime, and packing a committee is the same morally, even if it is not legally. Is this a sample of the "purification of politics" that the "reign of Christ over the nation" is to give us?

Mr. George went from Senator Pugh to Senator Wilson, whom he apprised of his assignment to the sub-committee. The Iowa Senator "accepted it kindly; will be very willing to serve, and his heart is right on all such questions." Mr. Elijah Morse, of Massachusetts, was the next friend of the amendment seen, and was found "brimful of interest." He at once called his stenographer, and dictated a letter to each member of the committee, insisting (he is not a member of the committee) that each one should be there on Tuesday morning.

He also sent word to Culberson saying that the two hours of that day would be for the friends of the cause; and if there should be opponents present, they might look out for another time. [Dees Mr. Morse run all the committees in that way?—Ed.] I said: "Would it not be better for us to divide the time with them and meet them?" "No," he said, "you have the grip on the subject; hold to it, and put in all your force. If they should get another time, we can perhaps be heard again. You must come that week prepared to stay all week."

Our contemporary to which we are indebted for this synopsis of Mr. George's remarkable confession, concludes with this pertinent question: "What do you think of all this, Freethinkers and honest Christians who love religious liberty and believe in fair play in politics?"
