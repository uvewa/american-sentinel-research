In the trial of Messrs McCutchen and Keck, in Gainesville, Ga., for Sunday labor, which resulted in the disagreement of the jury, and the setting of the case for retrial in May, no legal counsel was employed and Mr. McCutchen occupied nearly an hour and a half in an address to the jury. This address was an earnest and effective presentation of the truths and principles which apply in the case; only a condensed statement of the points made can be given here. The counsel for the State had previously cited the law and read the statutes upon which the action was brought. Taking advantage of the fact that the statutes use the three expressions "Sunday," "Sabbath," and "Lord's day," the defendant, in his plea before the jury, declared that the work in question was not done on the Sabbath, or Lord's day, and, that, as by the very language of the statute and the indictment the realm of the Lord's things had been entered, it was proper to go the Lord's Word—the only competent authority—to show what the Lord's day is. He contended that the labor in question had not been done on the Lord's day or the Sabbath. The Lord's day and Sabbath are synonymous. They are the seventh day. But Sunday is the first day, and statutory law cannot make them the same or decide that they are the same. Neither are statutes competent to decide the question as between Sunday and Sabbath. There is but one book competent to speak upon that subject. The speaker called for the court Bible and reminded the jury that it was the identical book upon which the witnesses had been sworn; from that book he read in the 20th chapter of Exodus, beginning at the eighth verse, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy, six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." This, the only competent authority, expressly states that the seventh day is the Sabbath day.

Sunday is the first day. This is the concurrent testimony of history. Pagan and Christian recognize Sunday to be the first day of the week. The seventh day and the first day are distinct days, the Sabbath is one, Sunday is the other, therefore, that Sabbath and Sunday are different days must be conceded. Sunday is a pagan institution. The fact that the day is called Sun day shows this to be so.

This work is charged to have been done on the Sabbath, the Lord's day. What day is the Sabbath? The seventh day. Upon what day of the week did Nov. 19, 1890 fall, the day in which it is charged this violation of the statute of Georgia took place? The first day. The question then necessarily arises as to whether the seventh day is still the Sabbath day. When a law is once enacted it remains in force until repealed. The only authority competent to repeal the law is the one that made it. You are bound to admit that the seventh day of the week is still the Sabbath unless it has been abrogated, and by divine authority. If there has been no such repeal it is a fact that the same day is the Sabbath to-day that was the Sabbath in the days of Moses.

Here the speaker entered into a detailed consideration of the passages of scripture in the New Testament referring to the first day of the week, showing in each case, from the context, that it was not the Sabbath to which reference was made. Many texts were also quoted and analyzed which spoke of the Sabbath, and contained intrinsic evidence that reference was not intended to the first day of the week. Thus the Bible was shown to give reciprocal testimony that the first day of the week is not the Sabbath, and the Sabbath is not the first day of the week.

The speaker brought explicit evidence that Christ left no record of a repeal of the law of the Sabbath, and that he and his apostles and followers observed the same seventh day during the life of Christ upon earth and after his crucifixion. He showed it to be the unanimous testimony of Scripture that the day remained the same. The custom of the apostles as to the observance of the Sabbath as found in the Acts of the Apostles was stated in detail. Indeed, in one place Paul preached in the synagogue for seventy-eight consecutive Sabbaths. If Paul preached to the Jews in the synagogue and on the Sabbath, it was necessarily on the seventh day. That he also himself actually observed the day, Acts 28:17, is conclusive proof, when he says: "Men and brethren though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans." He was addressing the Jews. He was a Jew. It was the custom of themselves and their fathers to observe the seventh day. Then in declaring that he had committed nothing at all against their custom he made a positive statement that he observed the same day they did.

This is amply sufficient to show which day the Sabbath day is both formerly, latterly, and all the way along. He who dares to say that that everlasting and eternal code in which is inscribed the Sabbath law may be changed or altered takes away the standard of all morality religion and right. In Matthew 5:17 is direct testimony that this law has not been changed: "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." The law of God, therefore, remains inviolate. The Sabbath has not been changed. We have not violated it, but after keeping it in conformity with scriptural direction, have worked on the first day of the week.

"As another demonstration of the identity of the Lord's day and the seventh day of the week, take two other statements of scripture. Mark 2:28 says, "The Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath." Ex. 20:10 says the seventh day is the Sabbath. Here are two plain statements of scripture which may form the premises of a syllogism thus:

"The Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath. The seventh day is the Sabbath. Therefore, the Son of man is Lord of the seventh day.

"Forming another syllogism, of which the above conclusion shall be the minor, we have this:

"Whatever day it is of which the Son of man is Lord, is the Lord's day.

"The Son of man is Lord of the seventh day.

"Therefore, the Lord's day is the seventh day."

But there is a claim that a change has been made since the first order of things. The Lord did not make the change. Who then has attempted it?
