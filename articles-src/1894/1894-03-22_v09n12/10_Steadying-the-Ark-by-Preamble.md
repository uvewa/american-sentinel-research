Just now there is another of the periodical spasms of anxiety about the name and being of God, in congressional circles, and Massachusetts leads the would-be pious campaign. Senator Frye and Representative Morse have introduced resolutions looking towards the introduction of God into the Constitution of the United States. These people would like to make of us a Christian nation by an act of Congress; legislate piety into our people. Granting for argument's sake that there is cause for this religious nervousness, the remedy proposed is childish. What imbecility of spirit is that that would undertake to stay the throne of the Eternal by a preamble? Chemistry cannot be made theistic by inscribing on the laboratory walls, "In God we trust," nor can astronomy be made devout by engraving a hymn upon the tube of the telescope. A pious creed does not necessarily make a pious church. The word "God" in the Constitution, or a Christian amendment to the same, will not change the prayerless hearts in the nation. The Government cannot be made theistic upon the adoption of a resolution by godless senators and the approval of the same perhaps by a profane president. Let Massachusetts lead in some better way.—Unity (Unitarian).
