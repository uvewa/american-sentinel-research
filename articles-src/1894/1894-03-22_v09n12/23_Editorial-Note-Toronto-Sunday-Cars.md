The question of Sunday street cars in Toronto will not down, and so the friends of a puritanic Sunday are appealing to the legislature to interfere in the matter and enact a law to prevent repeated submissions of the question to the people. This is characteristic of the Sunday movement throughout. The Sunday leaders are willing that the people should rule only when that rule is in favor of Sunday.
