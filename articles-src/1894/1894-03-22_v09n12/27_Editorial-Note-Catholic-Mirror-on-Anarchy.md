The Catholic Mirror gives this startling evidence of its comprehension of prophecy and understanding of the lessons of history:—

Yes, there will be revolts, insurrections and rebellious at the sound of the tocsin of anarchy, the torch of the incendiary will be applied to the capitalist's property as well as the dynamiter's bomb to his life; they will seek revenge and will find it; but neither in that ignoble satisfaction nor in compliance with the other desire of their heart, will they have the liberty for which they pant. . . . They will do a bloody work, to their own destruction; but they will also do God's work, for they will purify the elect, and separate the wheat from the chaff. . . Meanwhile let society awaken; . . . The approaching deluge can be averted as little as the persecution of the Christians during the first ages, or the French Revolution could be prevented. It will come. For it seems to belong to the designs of Providence and the plan of history.

Now let the Mirror look as clearly into the prophetic part that the great religious organization, of which it is a mouthpiece, is to play in this approaching deluge of violence.
