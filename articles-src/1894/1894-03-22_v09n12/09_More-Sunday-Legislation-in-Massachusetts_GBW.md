The effort to tone up our Massachusetts Sunday laws, because part of the community who think those whose views differ from them as to the sacred character of the day, are having altogether too much religious liberty, found expression in the following bill, a hearing on which was given, before the joint judiciary committee, Feb. 28:—

Whoever in any way manages, performs, or takes part in any entertainment, musicale, show or performance of any kind, nature, or description in any theater, museum or hall on the Lord's day, except sacred concerts under the auspices and for the benefit of any church or religious society, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $200.

The intolerant spirit back of this bill is worthy of the Dark Ages. Every one must be denied the privilege of any entertainment in any theater, hall or museum, upon Sunday, except such as are approved by the churches and are for their benefit. Such monstrous infringements upon the rights of others, in these times of gospel light, as this bill presented and advocated in the Massachusetts legislature is, is certainly a marked evidence of the decadence of the spirit of both civil and religious liberty. Elders R. C. Porter, Geo. E. Fifield, and others, remonstrated against the bill.

Geo. B. Wheeler.
