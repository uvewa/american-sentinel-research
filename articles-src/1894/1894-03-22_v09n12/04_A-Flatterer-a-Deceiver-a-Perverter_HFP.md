"And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he pervert by flatteries." Dan. 11:32, R. V.

"To pervert is to turn from the truth; to distort the truth from its true use and end; to pervert the laws by misinterpreting and misapplying them; to pervert the meaning of an author."—Webster.

This is exactly that kind of work described by the prophet of God in the text quoted; and it is very far from being honorable work. Indeed it is quite the reverse. It is a work of the most disreputable kind. To turn from and twist the truth; to misinterpret and misapply law; and to turn the true meaning of an author, or a document of merit, and so deceive the people is dishonorable, contemptible and misleading.

But this is precisely what is expressed in the text; and by whom? What is represented by the pronoun "he," in this verse? In the preceding verse two desolating powers are described as the "daily" desolation, and the "abomination that maketh desolate;" which for a long period were to desolate the Church of God. The two great desolating powers, which have been the scourge of the Church and of the world, are pagan and papal rule. The first was supplanted by the latter in A. D. 538; and since that time it has been the perverter of the principles of righteousness as proclaimed by that voice in Judea, which declared the utter separation of Church and State (Luke 20:25); and the rights of conscience of the individual. John 12:47. Never was this more apparent than at this present time.

How is it possible, in the light of the history of the past, that this dissolute power, the papacy, shall be able to so pervert the truth and the law—the fundamental law of the land—and as a result, pervert the people to its own perverted methods? Mark the law: "Pervert by flatteries." But notice another thing also. Those who are affected by these "flatteries," are those "who do wickedly against the covenant;" evidently those who think more of tradition—the false doctrines of the mother church, called "the wine of the wrath of her fornication;" of which all nations have drunk [Rev. 18:3]—than they do of "the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever." 1st Peter 1:23. And the prophet says, "But the people that do know their God [not know about God, but know their God;] shall be strong and do. Dan. 11:32. Being assured by this that those who "know their God," shall not be perverted by these "flatteries," turn now, for a moment to the work of the flatterer.

A flatterer is "one who flatters; a fawner, a wheedler, one who praises another to accomplish some purpose." To flatter is "to raise false hopes by representations not well founded. 'How many young and careless persons are flattered out of their innocence and their property by seducing arts.'"—Webster.

Is not this a most faithful picture of the situation of this youthful nation and the papacy to-day? This gigantic religion-political organization calling herself the church of Jesus Christ, and recognized by many a so-called Protestant as, at least, a branch of that church, now comes before us as the "author of religious liberty," the "protecting cordon" of "this their Republic," as the only "power" suitable "to hold up your Constitution above the storms of human passions;" none "more congenial to the spirit of your Republic;" none "more conducive to its stability than the Roman Catholic Church. She comes as "the foe to lawlessness," the champion of law and order," and "the saviour of society." She comes before us as the friend of education, assuring us that "Catholic education is the surest safeguard of permanence" to the Constitution, and "the best guide of the Republic in civil progress," and that "every Catholic school is a safe guardian of youth," and that "she is the fostering mother of the arts and sciences," and that Pope Leo "encourages scholarship by the establishment of universities or by giving them his blessing."

This "flatterer" would fain make us believe that she is the workingman's friend and protector; for "Leo XIII. has shown his love for the workingman." She comes saying: "We love liberty"!! for the church "grows and expands like the rose under the genial sun and air of liberty." And she professes "remarkable friendship for the republican system of government." All this is but a fulfillment of the words of the Spirit of God spoken through his prophet confaries ago. These are the words of a flatterer, words uttered for a purpose, and that, the purpose of the subjugation of this Government. And under this stupefying potion the sensibilities of professed Protestants are fast being beummbed. They have perverted the supreme law of the land, so that, to them it no longer means what it says; and so it stands, as misinterpreted, but a hollow mockery of those principles of which it has been regarded as the champion and safeguard. Yes, they have adopted the methods of the mother church in seeking and securing legislative recognition of a dogma of the mother, a religious institution—the Sunday—which is Church and State union, and spiritual adultery. They have set up the very image of the papacy, and now they talk just like her, manifesting the same spirit of egotism and presumption, and do not hesitate to claim to be the most law-abiding people of the land, the most loyal, the most patriotic.
