April 5, we shall commence the publication of a series of articles, which will be devoted to the examination of some of the fundamental errors of the Roman Catholic Church. Among the subjects discussed will be, Justification by faith or penance, which? Infallibility, where is it found? The real presence, in what does it consist? etc. Everybody, both Protestant and papist, ought to read these articles; certainly, no Sabbath-keeper can afford to miss them; and there can be no better missionary work among Catholics than supplying them with the papers containing these articles.
