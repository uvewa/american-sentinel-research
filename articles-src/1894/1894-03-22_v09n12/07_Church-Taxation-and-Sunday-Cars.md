Two or three years since a congregation of Baptists in Toronto, Canada, refused to accept exemption from taxation for their church property, and now a movement is on foot in that city to tax all such property. The following editorial from one of the Toronto papers states the main facts:—

### THE CLERGY AND EXEMPTIONS.

Some of the clergymen who took such an active part last summer in preventing half the citizens of Toronto from exercising their personal freedom on Sundays have now made a descent upon the legislature to protest against the proposal to rescind the section of the Municipal Act under which churches are exempted from municipal taxation. We can understand a be-nighted individual becoming conscientiously possessed of the idea that it is a sin to use the street-cars on Sunday, for some very queer ideas are begotten of religious enthusiasm. But we fail to conceive how any man professing Christianity can argue in favor of a law that compels the poor man who attends no church to contribute towards the support of the churches of the wealthy. The Church should be the very fountain of justice. Instead of that we see its priests dishonoring their high calling by petitioning Caesar to make others help to pay the taxes that justly are chargeable to themselves. The Founder of the Church himself would never have dragged his holy cause through the mire like this. In fact, he issued a distinct pronouncement to the contrary. "Bender unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's and unto God the things that are God's" are his own words, and the barefaced way in which the ministers of this city come forward and publicly counsel disobedience to that command tends to cast discredit on their profession.

In the case of the Sunday car movement they handicapped Christianity with inconsistency and inhumanity. To-day they are weighing it down with a further handicap in the shape of injustice, as indefensible as it is petty.

It is evident that the Toronto ministers are looking out for their own interests. No Sunday cars means larger congregations and larger collections, while no taxes means more money for the Sunday preachers. Has not the prophet Isaiah well described such ministers in these words? "They are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his own gain, from his quarter."
