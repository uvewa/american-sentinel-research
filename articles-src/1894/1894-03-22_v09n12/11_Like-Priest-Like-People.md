The following dispatch from Algona, Iowa, under date of March 13, published in the New York Sun of the 14th, is a pertinent commentary on the boastful claim of Rome that she is best promoter of Christian civilization:—

Father Eckert, the German Catholic priest at Wesley, indicted for keeping a nuisance and selling liquor contrary to law, pleaded guilty to-day and was fined $200 and costs, the smallest fine that could be made by the court. The priest built a large church sometime ago, and being heavily in debt, a number of festivals and fairs were given and a barroom was arranged in the basement, where the priest dispensed intoxicating liquors to his thirsty parishioners and others. The citizens of Wesley have circulated a petition asking Governor Jackson to have the priest's fine revoked.

Remember the priest was not fined for his religion, nor for doing anything that was in any way connected with his religion, but for violating the excise law. If the governor remits the fine how can he refuse to remit all fines imposed for similar offenses, unless indeed the State of Iowa proposes to establish the precedent of permitting Rome to ride roughshod over the statutes of the State for the purpose of increasing her revenues.
