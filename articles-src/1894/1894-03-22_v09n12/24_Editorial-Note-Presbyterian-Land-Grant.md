Representative Meiklejohn, of Nebraska, has reported from the House Committee on Public Lands a bill authorizing the issue of a patent to the Presbyterian Board of Home Missions for certain lands on the Omaha Indian Reservation. Meiklejohn's report was ordered printed and referred to the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union. Commenting upon this statement, for which the Congressional Record is authority, an exchange remarks:—

The union between Church and State, we presume, is the "union" to which reference is made; at least, that would be a fair inference from the nature of the report. The bestowal of public lands upon the Church is no new thing. Just here the question arises: Has Congress authority to give to a church any portion of an Indian reservation without the formal consent of the tribe to which the land belongs? But if the land in question is United States property, there is no question about the illegality of such action as that recommended in Mr. Meiklejohn's report.

We understood that the Presbyterians had decided not to accept any more appropriations from the Government. It is true that good resolve referred to money, but is not the same principle involved? Is there any essential difference between accepting money and demanding land?
