## "Confusion Worse Confounded."

For a hopeless jumble of sense and nonsense, of sound theology and of meaningless twaddle, the following, from the New York Independent, equals anything we remember to have seen:—

### Righteousness

We suppose that if Justice Roesch and the other witnesses who have, during the last week, testified before the Lexow Committee, were asked whether they were Christians, they would reply that they are. Very likely they are communicants, some of them—Breckinridge was—and go to church and do their "Easter duty." But they have a view of what makes Christianity very different from the biblical view. One cannot be a Christian without possessing righteousness, and these men and women confessed to very immoral deeds. A man who does what these police commissioners and police captains and district leaders are charged with is clearly not a righteous man. He may go to man or communion; but it is not clear how he can have any part in the blessing of the pure in heart, who shall see God.

We need very frequently to recall that righteousness is the core of religion. No one has put this fact better than President Fairchild, of Oberlin College, who said, in a memorable discourse:—

We must understand and implicate the doctrine that righteousness alone is piety, and obedience saving faith; that the highest Christian attainment is nothing more, and the lowest nothing less; and that the sole purpose of the manifestation of God in the soul is the fruit of the Spirit, the virtues and graces of the Christian life. The Church heads to be turned towards the experience of obedience and righteousness and duty-doing, as both conversion and manifestation. Would it not be a blessing to our land that the next great revival should be especially a revival of righteousness, so that men under the intense heat, shall be converted to honest and soulful obedience to God's law, rather than to any other experience?

President Fairchild is right; and such a fearful exposure of organized unrighteousness emphasizes the need of a revival of righteousness; and may we not say that a revival of righteousness is waiting for us? What is this Lexow investigation but a Parkhurst revival of righteousness, beginning with public confession and repentance? What are the similar movements to expose municipal corruption in Brooklyn, Boston and elsewhere, but a cry and prayer for municipal righteousness? We begin to discover that corporations have souls that need converting to righteousness, and every investigation of hidden crime is a lesson in righteousness.

To try to do real righteousness in the sight of God, in love to God and man, is the sum of duty; or, as President Fairchild says, "righteousness alone is picty." or, as a greater than any man has said, "He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and we will come unto him and make our abode with him."

It is the last two paragraphs that contain the nonsense. There is no righteousness but of God, and that comes to men only through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. And what has the Lexow investigation to do with faith in Christ? But what else can we expect of those who "discover that corporations have souls that need converting to righteousness"? Righteousness is a personal matter and comes only from the indwelling of Christ in the individual soul. Corporations can deal justly, they can conduct an honest business, but they can not, as corporations, have righteousness. The thought that civility, mere outward conformity to rules of right between man and man, is righteousness, is the very taproot of the National Reform heresy. It is an enemy of soul-liberty, and a soul-destroying error.
