THIS item of news and the comment upon the fact stated are from the Christian Advocate of this city:—

Four, if not five, young men of Harvard University were drowned on a recent Sunday while sailing. Our readers will not suppose that we believe that these five were especially selected by God for destruction because they were sailing on Sunday. Nevertheless, so long as genuine reverence exists for that day, the sadness of their taking off will in many minds be intensified by the time when it occurred. The habit and principle of making a distinction between the work and the consequence of other days, and a rational observance of the first day as specially dedicated to the worship of God and to philanthropic work, unquestionably contribute to safety, to health, to prolonged mental force and balance, no less than to the predominance of the spiritual over the ever-encroaching materialism of modern life.

The italics are just as the Advocate gave them. Oh no, it would not imply that these young men were drowned because they were sailing on Sunday, but—well it is much safer not to trespass upon the sacred(?) day. And so it goes; every accident and incident that can be used at all to awe anybody into Sunday observance is pressed into the service of the counterfeit Sabbath, a day of which the Scriptures say nothing except as an ordinary day. It is one of the six days given to man for labor, but men have exalted it to the place that rightfully belongs to the seventh day and then, without the fear of God before them, try to make it appear that he protects their man-made institution by a special providence. Will he not one day demand of them: "Who hath required this at your hand?"
