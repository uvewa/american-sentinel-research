Too much of the opposition to popery is on the ground that Catholics are getting more than their share of the public funds. In a recent interview William Allen Butler is reported to have said: "Cold, hard figures show that in the city of New York alone the municipal aid given to Roman Catholic institutions amounted to $1,200,000, while but $75,000 was given to the Protestant institutions. This enterprise, in getting a share of the public funds, is characteristic of the church referred to," said Mr. Butler, "and I do not complain of this enterprise, but if we are going to have a distribution of the public money we should have a fair one." There can be no fair distribution of public money among organizations not entitled to it. Every dollar of public money appropriated for religious purposes is misappropriated, and there could be nothing fair about it even if every church in the state were to receive a pro rata share. It is the principle, not the workings, of the system, that is wrong.
