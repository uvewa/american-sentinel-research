## Applying Church Discipline in Civil Government.

Advice to Sabbath Defense Committees.

CIVIL government is a divine institution.

—Romans 13: 1-7.

Therefore:

1st. Realize that your duties are a department of that work to which your Lord and Master has called you.

2nd. Undertake the work in his name and in the spirit of his gospel.

3rd. When an offense against the law is known to you, in the spirit of Matthew 18: 15-20, send one of your members, wisely selected, to talk to him (or her); whose duty it shall be to show the offender wherein he is violating the law and try to persuade him to desist, giving him reasonable time to consider the matter, if necessary. If reformation does not follow this effort within a reasonable time send a committee of two of your members that they make another and similar effort. Success will often crown the first, or second effort, but if not and you are convinced that other and more effective measures must be resorted to, make formal and definite complaint to the proper civil officer, requesting him to do his duty as prescribed by the law and in his oath of office.

4th. If the said official refuse or fail to perform his duty, make complaint in writing to his superior in office.

5th. If all this results in disappointment and failure, one of two things remains, either secure the impeachment of the delinquent official and his consequent removal; or institute process in law against the violator, if he still continues the offense, remembering complaint must be made within seventy-two hours after the offense is committed.

6th. Through the pastors of the churches secure the appointment of one Lord's day annually, when a sermon on the question of the Sabbath shall be preached from every pulpit.

7th. See to it that a representative delegation attend every county or State Sabbath convention.—Pennsylvania Sabbath Association, in Christian Statesman.
