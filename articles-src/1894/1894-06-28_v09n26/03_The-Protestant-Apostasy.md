### The Protestant Apostasy.

The more the student reads of the first three centuries of Church history, the more does he realize how just is the charge against the Roman Church of a great apostasy. It was because the Church followed the line of the least resistance, that in many instances she seemed to gain some of her greatest victories, and it was because the line of the least resistance was often the line of compromise and ambition, that her seeming victories proved in the end disastrous defeats.

The ambition of Christian leaders founded the Church upon the hope of a political supremacy, and the Roman Empire was too tempting a heritage to be refused, when at last in its weakness it became ready to surrender to Christian leaders. The frightful catastrophe was that, when thus tempted, political supremacy usurped the place of Christian principle. This was the temptation that faced our Lord in the wilderness. It is not supposable for a moment that he was tempted to accept the kingdoms of the world simply for their own sake, but as a means to an end, that they might be made subject to divine authority. His victory was the refusal of political power as the method of his conflict, and accepting the cross as the only way for the establishment of his Father's kingdom.

The Reformation was a returning to Christ. First and foremost, it was a moral movement. The scoffs and jeers of the literary world, the contempt and ridicule of poet and playwright, were all unheeded by the papacy at Rome. It could afford, not only to bear the jest and jibe, but even to take part in the laughter and applaud the wit. But when a few loyal men, under the inspiration of a new moral purpose, lifted up the Christ of history and unchained the pages of the New Testament, then it was that the Roman hierarchy bestirred itself to put down what it rightly realized could only end in its ruin. That return to Christ was the significant event of European history.

But now we behold a Protestant anarchy that is calling forth the jibe and jeer, the scoff and jest, the contempt of the novelist, and the silent indifference of the great, un-Christlike world. Protestantism in its power can afford to talk mildly of confederation and comity, but it is guilty of an apostasy scarcely less significant than the political apostasy of the first four centuries.

American Protestantism boasts of its increasing numbers, its enormous wealth, and its so-called benevolence. Never was there a time in Jewish history when outwardly Judaism seemed either more prosperous or more self-confident than at the time of Christ. Judaism was respected by Rome, and had immense power with Caesar. She was wealthy beyond all the dreams of the poor little band of pilgrims that left Babylon four hundred years before. She could boast of hundreds of synagogues scattered all over the Roman world, and even half foreign potentates were proud to build temples to the honor of Judaism, to claim some touch of Jewish blood, and to acknowledge Jehovah as their God. But Judaism was thriving upon the house of the widow torn from her under the forms of law. The synagogues fattened upon the money that was wrung from the oppressed nations, and the hierarchy was securely intrenched in its self-righteousness and respectability, neglecting the people who knew not the law and were accursed, and calling vainly upon Jehovah, even while his avenging sword hung over the temple. Before Jerusalem there were two alternatives, to accept Christ with all that it meant of struggle with triumphant prosperity, or to crucify the Christ and fall into the hands of the living God. Jerusalem crucified the Christ; the page of history tells the rest.

Before, both Roman and Protestant communions in these United States there is standing the crucified Saviour with the same question on his lips to-day as of old, "What think ye of me?" Before us is the alternative of a death grapple with the powers of unrighteousness, that have usurped the places in our churches and governed in our councils, or to fall into the hands of the living God, to have church history write once more the story of apostasy and its penalty.—Thomas C. Hall, in the Evangelist.
