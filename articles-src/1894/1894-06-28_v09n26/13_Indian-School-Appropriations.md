CONGRESS is hearing some very wholesome truths in connection with the discussion of the various religious bills or bills more or less directly affecting religious institutions. In the House on the 14th inst. Mr. Bowers, of California, said:—

Mr. Chairman, I am not a member of any church; but so far as my observation has gone then: is not much difference in these denominations; they are much alike; but I want to call your attention to the scene presented in this House during the last week. This House has witnessed an acrimonious religious debate, brought on through appropriations made for the support of sectarian schools. It is a question that you must meet sometime, and very soon, and I think my amendment meets it.—Congressional Record, June 15, page 7448.

Mr. Bowers' amendment reads as follows:—

**Provided,** That from and after the first day of July, 1896, no money shall be appropriated or expended for the transportation of any pupil to or from any Indian school, nor for the support and education of any Indian at any school except such as is located on or near an Indian reservation or convenient thereto, and under Government control, and excepting also the public schools of any State or Territory.

Of course, the Congress of the United States was not prepared to adopt anything so sound and far-reaching as this. The Roman Catholic lobby has too firm a hold upon the Government to allow any such action now. The contract schools will get their money as usual.
