As good a comment as we have seen recently on Luke 21:25, 26, is furnished in these words by an Iowa paper of recent date:—

Raging rivers, bursting dams, death dealing cyclones, murderous anarchists, restless monarchs, idle wage earners, trembling hearts, starving thousands—a few of the week's items.

And these things are simply the beginning of the end. "The darkest hour is just before day." The long dark night of sin is nearly past. Eternal day is soon to dawn—but not for all. The prophet says: "The morning cometh, and also the night." Isa. 21:12. Only "to those who look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation." Heb. 9:28.
