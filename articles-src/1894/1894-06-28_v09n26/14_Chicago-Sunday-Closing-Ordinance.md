MAYOR HOPKINS, of Chicago, has vetoed the Sunday-closing ordinance adopted by the city council some days ago. The mayor says:—

I cannot sanction a measure which under the guise of a police regulation to the preservation of the peace and good order of society on the Sabbath so radically interferes with the private affairs of the citizens.

I cannot take the view that in a large city the keeping open of a shoe store or a barber shop disturbs the good order of society, however desirable the closing thereof may be from the standpoint of the overworked employe or in the interest of a religious observance of Sunday.

The proper and legitimate remedy for the overworked employe of the stores mentioned in the ordinance is either State legislation, or, far better, the peaceable, but determined, assertion of the power of organized labor, which has already accomplished such wonderful results in the matter of the reduction of the hours of toil and the amelioration of the condition of the working classes.

Why the mayor thinks it would be any better for the State to interfere with the private affairs of the citizen than for the city to do it, does not appear. His latter suggestion that employes can secure all they desire by simply asserting their rights in the matter is good. No man is compelled to work on Sunday, and the man who has any conscience on the subject will not do it.
