Any one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.

THE Catholics and Hebrews in this city are making a strong fight against the proposed constitutional amendment, which is destined, if adopted, to deprive all sectarian institutions of all State aid.

MICHAEL TANCEY, a justice of the peace, at Fort Wayne, Ind., publishes a statement that from June 24, 1889, to June 7, 1894, he has had 114 criminal cases in his court, and of these, sixteen were "Sabbath desecration cases."

ONE Adventist at Church Hill, Md., has been arrested three times within a few days for Sunday work. He was found guilty each time, notwithstanding the fact that on one of the Sundays specified he was sick in bed. The function of a Maryland justice is to convict, if the charge be Sunday work, and the accused an Adventist.

THE article, "History Repeating Itself," on page 204, of this paper, will bear not only reading but thought. The most significant fact about it is that what is true of this nation is also true of the civilized world. Distrust with its train of evils is world-wide. Everywhere want is to be seen on the one hand and luxury on the other. The result is inevitable. Anarchy and ruin await the world.

THE Field Columbian Museum at Chicago was formally opened to the public on the 4th inst. This museum is "the epitome and memorial of the great World's Columbian Exposition. The public will be admitted free of charge on Saturdays and Sundays. On all other days an admission fee of twenty-five cents will be charged, except to school children, who will always be admitted free on presentation of a certificate from their teachers.

A LEGISLATIVE committee is investigating the police department of New York City and some very startling facts have been elicited. It seems that for years the whole police force, from the highest to the lowest, has been a veritable cesspool of corruption. Instead of suppressing vice the police have grown rich upon it; they have levied blackmail, not only on prostitution, on illegal liquor selling, and on gambling, but on legitimate business as well. Police commissioners, police justices, and police captains have all shared in this corrupt business. "Bunco stee-ers," gamblers, and even "green goods" men have received police protection for a share of the profits of the business. If Sing Sing does not receive a large accession of population as a result of this investigation it will be because "judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter."

JUNE 13, Ex-priest McNamara, accused of slandering priests and nuns at Kansas City, Mo., was found not guilty. McNamara's defense was that he accused the Romish Church in general of all manner of iniquities. The verdict, though eminently just, was a good deal of a surprise to the prosecution. The ex-priest had not slandered the Roman Catholic Church; he had told the truth about it. There is no occasion to go beyond the truth in speaking against Rome.

JUNE 17, Peoria, Ill., observed Sunday. For the first Sunday in many years all the business houses in the place and most of saloons were closed. A few of the latter kept open, and will be prosecuted. It was also announced that in the future not even the sale of Chicago papers would be permitted. But Peoria still manufactures more whisky than any other place in the world. The religion of the place is not of the kind that sacrifices anything to conscience. United States law prohibits distilling on Sunday, and as that is the principal business of Peoria, everything else might as well stop too.

THE authorities at Church Hill, Md., who are pursuing the Adventists for exercising their God-given right to work on Sunday, are casting about to see if there is not some law that will prevent the teaching of Adventist doctrine concerning the Sabbath and Sunday. This is only logical. If the State has a right to forbid Sunday labor it certainly may forbid men to incite to such labor. The attorney-general of the 12th Judicial District of Tennessee, told one of the editors of this paper, that it would probably come to that in Tennessee; and it must come to that everywhere. If the State forbids Sunday work it must likewise forbid the teaching of that view of the Sabbath question which leads men to work on Sunday.

COMMENTING on a single remark by a Southern minister, the New York Sun says: "At the present time the spirit of Puritanism is stronger and more prevalent at the South than at the North. It has been losing its force in all the Northern States during the last fifty years, . . . but in the South it is now almost as powerful as ever. It is the spirit that had animated Methodism from the beginning; and at the South the dominant religious sentiment is Methodist." Sabbath-keepers under indictment and under bonds and languishing in Southern prisons, are living witnesses to the truth of this statement.

SUNDAY, June 17, Charles Cederquis, a private, in the Second United States Infantry, stationed at Omaha, Neb., refused, on religious grounds, to attend rifle practice. He was put in the guard house to await trial by court-martial. This is wrong. No man should be compelled to perform any such service on a day which he regards as sacred to rest and worship. In this case it was certainly wholly unnecessary, and the man's conscience ought to be respected. In time of actual warfare there might be some excuse for such an arbitrary exercise of power, but not now.

HON. WALEY LYON, the Republican nominee for lieutenant-governor of Pennsylvania, was a member of the upper house of the Pennsylvania legislature at its last session and favored the repeal of the special law making the penalty for violation of the Sunday law of 1794 §25, in Allegheny County, instead of §4 as it is in the rest of the State. Mr. Lyon has thus incurred the enmity of the Sunday people of Pennsylvania, and the Christian Statesman is urging them to vote against him and secure, if possible, his defeat at the election in November. Thus the Sunday question will be an issue in the State election.

It is stated from Rome that the pope is about to issue another encyclical, which is intended to be his political testament. It is said, but not authoritatively, that "following the example of Christ, who, on the eve of his ascent to heaven, prayed that his disciples might be united, the pope expresses his desire to close his life with an appeal to all men of every land and race to favor unity of faith;" that is, the pope invites all men to become Roman Catholics. "He expresses his sorrow for the schisms and animosities which have torn great civilized nations from the Roman Church, and tells of his hope that divine mercy and omnipotence will bend the wills of men and bring them back to the one true faith." He makes a special plea to Protestants and denounces Freemasons as enemies of Christian unity.
