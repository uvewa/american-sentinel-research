## A Triumphal Entry.

AN event of the greatest importance, as indicating the flourishing condition of Catholic interests in the East was the recent triumphal entry into Jerusalem of the Rev. Father Aurelio Bujo, the newly appointed Custodian of the Holy Land.

From the time of his arrival at Jaffa, all were convinced that the new custodian was the object of the greatest interest, as was manifested by the sympathy shown for him, not only by the mass of the people, but by the Turkish authorities. On the arrival of the Rev. Father Aurelio at Jerusalem, he was received at the station by the consuls of all the Catholic nations, by the Turkish authorities, and by the entire body of Catholics. And in addition to the enthusiasm thus manifested by the people, and the civil authorities, a body of Turkish cavalry was sent out to escort the new custodian to his residence.—Catholic Review.
