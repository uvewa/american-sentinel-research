## Religious Persecution in Maryland.

Church Hill, Md., June 15, 1894.

**EDITORS** AMERICAN SENTINEL: Another one of our brethren here, Wm. G. Curlett, was arrested to-day for working on Sunday, June 3, and 10. He was brought before the magistrate and found guilty, although the testimony in the June 3 case was false, in that the witness swore he saw him at work between 8 and 9 o'clock in the morning, when, as a matter of fact, Brother Curlett was in bed until about 4 o'clock, P. M., being sick that day.

The church member who is engineering these malicious persecutions of our people, is a constable, who procures evidence by the detective plan; not for love of the violated law, but from pure malice and hatred against our work.

The peculiarity of the Maryland Sunday law is that it is only worked against Adventists, as it is well known and admitted that Sunday keepers(?) violate the law, and yet no attempt is made to punish them.

S. B. HORTON.
