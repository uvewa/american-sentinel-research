**THE** following, from the Mail and Express, is quite remarkable for that paper:

On Sunday afternoon Mr. Stephen T. Moen, the "Liberty" agent, at No. 1786 Broadway, was arrested for an alleged violation of the Sabbath. The officer who made the arrest claims that Mr. Moen sold him a twelve cent bottle of his celebrated Liberty Cycle Oil. This Mr. Moen denies. Mr. Moen was brought up before Judge Voorhees in Yorkville Police Court this morning and was held under $100 bonds to appear in Special Sessions for this unprecedented crime.

"The leading evening paper" should find no fault with even the most rigid enforcement of the Sunday law; it has always defended religious legislation and a Puritanical Sunday. If the principle is wrong in the case of a bottle of Cycle Oil it is wrong in everything else. The principle is wrong; why cannot the Mail and Express see it?
