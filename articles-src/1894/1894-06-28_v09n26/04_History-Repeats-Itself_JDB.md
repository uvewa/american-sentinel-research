### History Repeats Itself.

There is a striking similarity between the conditions that exist in this country to-day, and those which existed in France prior to and at the opening of the Revolution of a hundred years ago. Below are a few of these comparisons:

|  LOOK ON THIS. | THEN ON THIS.  |
| --- | --- |
|  1. At the death of Louis XV., in 1774, the lower orders of the French people had been brought to a state of extreme indigence and suffering, by the luxuries of a dissolute and despotic court, during a long period of misrule.—Wilson's Outlines of History. | 1. The following head these are taken from a paper of recent date: "Helpless Women Starve to Death on the Streets of Chicago, While Our Pintocrats Roll in Wealth never Desamed by Oriental Princes." This paper then goes on to give accounts which show that the lower orders of the people in this country have "been brought to a state of extreme indigence and suffering."  |
|  The rich had found no rebuke for their oppression of the poor, the poor no help for their servitude and degradation. The selfishness of the wealthy and powerful grew more and more apparent and oppressive. For centuries the greed and profligacy of the noble resulted in grinding extortion toward the peasant. The rich wronged the poor, and the poor hated the rich. In many provinces the estates were held by the nobles, and the laboring classes were only tenants; they were at the mercy of their landlords, and were forced to submit to their exorbitant demands. "The pleasure of the nobles was considered the supreme law; the farmers and the peasants might starve, for ought their oppressors cared . . . | The Secretary of State, Kansas, as reported in the Chicago Herald of July 28, 1899, says: "Every thinking man knows there is a great conspiracy between the corporations which extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, for the purpose of grinding down the laboring masses. The laboring man has no rights which they respect. They control the courts and the legislative halls, and every law on the statistic books in this broad land of ours is in the interest of the man with money and against the poor laborer. The burdens with which the people are oppressed are becoming  |

The people were compelled at every turn to consult the exclusive interests of the landlord. . . . The courts of justice would always listen to a noble as against a peasant; bribes were notoriously accepted by the judges; and the merest caprice of the aristocracy had the force of law, by virtue of this system of universal corruption."—Great Controversy, pp. 279, 280.

2. To find a remedy for the disordered state of the French finances and the decline of public credit, was the first difficulty which Louis XVI had to encounter, nor did he surmount it until he found himself involved in the vortex of a revolution. Minister after minister attempted it, sometimes with partial success, but oftener with an increase of the evil.—Wilson's Outlines of History.

3. The nobility, the courtiers and the clergy, who were interested in maintaining all kinds of abuses, protested against any sacrifices on their part. . . . The clergy, the nobility, and the magistracy, obstinately refused the surrender of their exclusive privileges, while on the other hand the philosophic party, considering the Federal Republic of America as a model of government, desired to break up the entire framework of society and construct the edifice anew.—Ibid.

4. The men who impoverished their fellow-subjects were themselves exempt from taxation, and entitled by law or custom to all the appointments of the State.—Great Controversy, p. 280.

General taxation of the nobility and the clergy, as well as the commons, was proposed, and in order to obtain a sanction to the measure, an assembly of the notables was called; but although the assembly at first assented to a general tax, the national parliament defeated the project.—Wilson's Outlines of History.

5. The year (1789) had been one of famine. The people everywhere were suffering for bread. . . . France imagined for the hour that the States General, which soon resolved itself into the National Assembly, could make bread as well as a new constitution, but the bread did not appear.—Bilgarth.

Paris became one vast almatouse, and it is estimated that, at the breaking out of the Revolution, two hundred thousand paupers claimed charity from the hands of the king.—Great Controversy, p. 279.

6. A spirit of insubordination began to appear in Paris, caused in some degree, by the pressure of famine; journals and clubs multiplied; declaimers he ranged in every street, ing more numerous every day."

Courts of justice are corrupt. Rulers are actuated by desire for gain and love of several pleasure. . . . Jurists are perverted, bribed, deluded. "Justice standeth after off; for truth is fallen in the street and equity cannot enter."—Great Controversy, p. 586.

2. To find a remedy for the disordered state of American finances, etc., is a difficulty with which our Government is confronted to-day, and it seems to be having little better success than did the ministers of Louis XVI. The Atlanta Constitution of April 23, 1894 (editorial), speaking of the result of the extra session of Congress, says: "Everywhere there are unmistakable signs of restlessness, discontent, and suffering."

3. The plutocratic monopolists, on the one hand, demand legislation that will make them richer and impoverish the masses. . . . On the other hand the distressed workingmen of the country demand free rations first, and profitable work a little later.—Atlanta Constitution (editorial), April 23, 1894. The workingmen, in making these demands, consider the cooperative common wealth idea of government and desire to have the government reconstructed upon that model.—See Socialist Labor Party Platform, 1893.

4. The Atlanta Constitution, of February 2, in an editorial on the income tax which is now before Congress, says: "It will lighten the burden of taxation heretofore borne by the wage workers and consumers. For the first time in a generation the classes who have been enriched by the favoritism of the Government will be called upon to bear their just and proportionate share of the public expenses." And although the lower House has assented to this tax it is probable that the Senate will yet defeat the project.

5. Speaking in the United States Senate on May 10, Senator Teller said: "Mr. President, there has never been an hour in American history, in the great panics of 1893, when there has been so much poverty, so much distress, so much danger to the Republic as there has been in the last year." And many people, as for instance, the "Armies of the Commonweal," seem to imagine that Congress can make bread as well as laws. A recent issue of the Baltimore Sun, in an editorial, says: "New York City points with pride to the fact that its well-to-do people have given $15,000,000 the past winter to keep its working people from starvation."

6. Said Senator Stewart on the same day that Senator Teller spoke as quoted above: "There has been no time in the history of the United States when discontent was so general and directed the popular indignation against the king and his family; and the very rabble imbibed the intoxicating spirit of politics. When a regiment of French troops mutinied, and their leaders were thrown into prison, a mob of six thousand men liberated them; collisions took place between the populace and the royal guards.—Wilson's Outlines of History.

7. Towards the latter part of August (1789) the famine had become so severe in Paris (a natural consequence of the public convulsions and the suspension of credit) that mobs were frequent in the streets, and the bakery shops were surrounded by multitudes, clamoring for food, while the most extravagant reports were circulated, charging the scarcity upon the court and the aristocrats. . . . On the 5th of October a crowd of the lowest rabble, armed with pikes, forks and clubs, marched to Versailles (the headquarters of the government). They penetrated into the Assembly vociferously demanding bread. Ibid.

8. One noticeable feature of the Revolution was the part the women took in it; in many instances surpassing the men in deeds of violence.

9. The fatal error which wrought such woe for the inhabitants of France was the ignoring of this one great truth; that true freedom lies within the prescriptions of the law of God. . . . When the restraints of God's law were cast aside, it was found that the laws of man were inadequate to hold in check the powerful tides of human passion; and the nation swept on to revolt and anarchy.—Great Controversy, pp. 583, 592.

10. The news papers recently contained accounts of how women seized a train for one of the "industrial armies" in the West, and how they fought with the striking miners in the Pennsylvania coke regions. And do we not see already a tinge of representing the object of worship by women which characterized the Revolution, in the "goddesses" which head some of the "armies"?

11. Many ministers are teaching their people, and many professors and teachers are instructing their students that the law of God has been changed or abrogated. . . . Would we know the result of making void the law of God? The experiment has been tried. Terrible were the scenes enacted in France when atheism became the controlling power. . . . Already the doctrine that men are released from obedience to God's requirements has weakened the force of moral obligation, and opened the flood-gates of iniquity upon the world.—Great Controversy, pp. 583, 584, 585.

These parallels might be multiplied, and additional evidence might be given to support the ones already shown, but these will suffice to prove what was stated at the opening of this article. I now ask if human nature has undergone any change during the last century, and if like causes will not now produce like results?

Congress yielded to the "popular demand" for a Sunday law, and now it finds itself confronted, not with one only, but several "popular demands." And if Congress is right in protecting the interests of the preachers by stopping everything that competes with them on their day—Sunday—why should it not protect the interests of the workingmen and do as well by the masses, as it has done by the clergy and the classes, by giving them what they demand—"free rations first and profitable work a little later"?

Her priests have violated [offered violence to, margin] my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my Sabbaths, and I am profaned among them. Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain. The people of the land have used oppression and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully. . . Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord God." Eze. 22:26-31.

"III fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,
Where wealth accumulates and men decay."

—Goldsmith.
