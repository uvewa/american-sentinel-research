THE Roman Catholic press is well pleased with the Independent, of this city, because it has been rubbing the papal fur the right way. Sycophancy is always well-pleasing to Rome. Centuries ago inspiration said of this wicked power: "Through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by prosperity shall destroy many." But at last "he shall be broken without hand," for he shall be "cast alive into the lake burning with fire and brimstone."
