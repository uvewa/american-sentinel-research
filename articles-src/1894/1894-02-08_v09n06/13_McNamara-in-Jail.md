THE Roman Catholics have, or at least had, McNamara, the anti-Catholic lecturer in jail in Kansas City; and a popish paper suggests for him five years in the penitentiary. McNamara's offense is telling the naked truth about the confessional and the nunneries. It is not to be supposed that Rome will stand that sort of thing very much longer in this country.

Already the Western Watchman boasts that if such things "were printed in a newspaper the sheet would be confiscated and its publisher fined;" and when the bill introduced into the House, Dec. 13, 1893, by Mr. Hayes of Iowa, shall have become a law, everything of the kind can certainly be excluded from the United States mails. Rome is beginning to feel and exercise her power.
