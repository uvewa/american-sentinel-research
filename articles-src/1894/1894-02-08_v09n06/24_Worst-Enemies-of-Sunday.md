THE Christian Intelligencer thinks that the worst enemies of Sunday are those who invoke the civil law against observers of the Sabbath. It says:—

The worst enemies of a day of rest and worship are those who enforce the penalties of the civil law against persons who conscientiously observe the seventh day of the week, and therefore pursue their ordinary vocations on the first day. So long as such persons do not hinder others from enjoying the rest and privilege of Sunday, they are entitled to pursue their own chosen course without let or hindrance.

Surely they are; but are they entitled to pursue their own course any more than are others who "do not hinder others from enjoying the rest and privilege of Sunday"? Is not the whole system of Sunday legislation at fault? Is it a correct principle that requires a man to have some religion before he can do as he pleases so long as he does not hinder others from enjoying like liberty?
