DECEMBER 29, Mr. Crafts, late of the so-called Christian Statesman, lectured before the Baltimore Ministerial Union on his favorite theme, i.e., how to make people keep Sunday. After enumerating the difficulties encountered in enforcing the "civil" Sunday, Mr. Crafts said that in the State of Maryland, a new element has arisen, namely, human sympathy for those who have been imprisoned for working on Sunday. He then ridiculed this sympathy and tried (with poor success, however, be it said to the credit of his audience), to provoke a laugh at the expense of the recently imprisoned men. But he seemed to stand in awe of the milk of human kindness, and so told his hearers how it could be effectually dried up. His plan to overcome this dangerous element, human sympathy, is to have each minister "write personally to his representative" in the legislature protesting against any repeal or modification of the Maryland Sunday law. "Write!" "write!" says this modern inquisitor general, who, while professing to deprecate the prosecution of Sabbath-keepers for private Sunday work, covertly aids and abets it. Maryland Sabbath-keepers have nothing to hope from man, but Deo adjuvante, non timendum. The injunction of our Saviour is to the point: "Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell."

C. P. B.
