## Sunday Here and There.

[These items are taken from the column of "News Worth Telling" in the Christian Statesman of January 27, and are given just as they appeared there except that we call the pagan holiday by its proper name, "Sunday," instead of dubbing it "Sabbath," as does the Statesman. The Lord says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God," and we are not going to say that the first day is the Sabbath. "Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil."]

A COMMITTEE of five Episcopal clergymen, in Providence, R. I., was recently appointed to consider the better enforcement of the laws against the desecration of Sunday. —At the persistent solicitation of the workmen, the Holyoke paper mills have ceased to run on Sunday. The mills will stop at midnight Saturday and start at midnight Sunday. —Eight thousand candy, cigar and other stores are open in Philadelphia on Sunday. A petition signed by nine hundred voters was prepared by the Philadelphia Sabbath Association and presented to the mayor on last Friday asking that all stores, except those provided for in the act of 1794 as necessary, shall be closed on Sunday. —A canvass of the new city council of Toronto shows a majority against the resubmission of the Sunday street car question to a vote this summer. —In his address at the last annual meeting of the American Sabbath Union, Rev. Plum of Boston, charged the secularization of public thought on the Sunday question mainly upon the Sunday newspapers. —The Congregationalist states that the custom of giving quiet dinner parties on Sunday evening is increasing especially in our cities. This custom must cease if the Sunday is to remain. —Comparatively few persons who break the Sunday laws are prosecuted; and yet $1,996 were paid into the sinking fund of the Pennsylvania treasury from such fines during the year 1893. If all cases of Sunday breaking were fined, such as railroads and others, the State treasury would be filled. —The Theocrat of Johnstown, boldly asserts that the Sunday-travelling habit of many ministers, leading Christians, camp meeting projectors and managers, are among the chief promoters of Sunday breaking. If the religious press of our land would ring out with the clarion voice of our contemporary of the Conemaugh Valley this accusation could not long be truthfully made. —At the request of the Evangelical Alliance, all the ministers of St. Louis preached Sunday, Jan. 14, on "The Observance of the 'Lord's day' in Secular Matters." This was the result of the letter sent to the alliance by the Retail Clerk's Association concerning Sunday opening of which we made mention last week.
