THE Congressional Record of January 25, has the following, second column of page 1503:

Mr. Perry. I introduce, by request of the officers of the National Reform movement, a proposed amendment to the Constitution, which I ask may be read and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.

The joint resolution (S. R. 56) proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States was read the first time by its title and the second time at length, and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, as follows:

"Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House concurring therein), That the following amended form of the preamble of the Constitution of the United States be proposed for ratification by conventions in the several States; which, when ratified by conventions in three-fourths of the States, shall be valid as a part of the said Constitution, namely:

"PREAMBLE.

"We, the people of the United States, devoutly acknowledge the supreme authority and just government of Almighty God in all the affairs of men and nations; grateful to him for our civil and religious liberty, and encouraged by the assurances of his Word to involve his guidance, as a Christian nation, according to his appointed way, through Jesus Christ, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves; and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution of the United States of America."

The same joint resolution was introduced in the House on the same day by Mr. Morse of Massachusetts. It was in both cases referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.
