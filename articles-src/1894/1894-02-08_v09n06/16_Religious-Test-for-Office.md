THERE is a vacancy in the Board of Regents of the University of this State, caused by the death of the Right Rev. Francis McNeirny, Catholic Bishop of Albany. This vacancy the legislature must fill by election, and as the place was formerly filled by a papist, some of the papers are urging that it be filled from the ranks of that communion. Touching this suggestion, the New York Sun (Democratic) says:

The Republicans of the legislature are not likely to consult the Times Union in filling this vacancy, though they may go to the town of Albany, where it is published, for their candidate. If they establish any religious test or condition of membership of the Board, they will be taking a new departure. The religious convictions of Regents of the University form no part of the qualifications of candidates. The old and well-established rule of filling such vacancies with reference to the question of fitness only, is a good one which cannot be departed from with safety.

This is sensible. There is no sense in the idea that a Roman Catholic should be chosen simply because a member of that church formerly held the office. Men should be chosen for civil offices without the slightest reference to their religious faith. Our laws as yet know no religious qualifications for office.

Since the foregoing was written, the following item from the Albion, Nebraska, News, has come to our notice:

The Catholic deputy sheriff has at last been announced, and Phil Langan is the lucky man. They are surely entitled to this much recognition for electing the populist ticket last fall; in fact, it is hard to believe that they will be satisfied with so insignificant a portion.

Has it indeed come to this that the offices must be divided up among the churches?
