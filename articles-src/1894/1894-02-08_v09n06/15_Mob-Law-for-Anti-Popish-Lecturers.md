IN addition to the note quoted in the preceding paragraph, the Watchman has, in the same issue, namely January 25, an editorial of nearly a column written in defense of mob law for anti-popish lecturers. The Watchman says:

Who can blame them [Roman Catholics] if they rise up to strike the blasphemer in the month? These miscerant travellers should not be protected. If their occupation excites to riot they should be made to choose some other calling. If they cannot be restrained by statute or ordinance let them carry their hides to the market; and if they get holed, let it be charged to the profit and loss of the business.

The editor of the Watchman is a Roman Catholic priest, "Rev." D. S. Phelan, a professed minister of Him, "who when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not, but committed the keeping of his soul to him who judgeth rightensuly." But "as the heavens are higher than the earth," so are God's ways higher than the ways of the papacy.
