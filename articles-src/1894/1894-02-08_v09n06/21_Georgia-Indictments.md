WE learn from the Review and Herald, of Battle Creek, Mich., that W. A. McCutchen and Elmer C. Keck, the Seventh-day Adventist minister and teacher, fined $50 each, and costs, some weeks ago, in Gainesville, Ga., for Sunday work, have been indicted for the same offense, by the grand jury and will be tried the last week in February.
