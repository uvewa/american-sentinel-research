"Religious Liberty Library," No. 18.

THIS important number of the Library is now ready. It is entitled "Christ and the Sabbath: or Christ's Faithfulness in Sabbath-keeping," being substantially the same matter as appeared in the November Home Missionary, as a sermon by Elder A. T. Jones, at the Lansing, Mich., camp meeting. It has been revised and very much improved, some important additions being made. It presents a striking parallel between the course of the Pharisees and Herodians in accusing, persecuting, and even killing Christ, for not keeping the Sabbath according to their own ideas, and the course pursued by the "Pharisees and Herodians" of our own day against those who follow Christ's example.

This is an excellent number to follow up Nos. 14, 15, and 16. "Christ and the Sabbath" shows what the true Sabbath is; "Rome's Challenge" shows what the spurious Sabbath is; "Our Answer" shows our attitude during the contest between the true and the spurious Sabbaths; and No. 18 sets forth Christ as our example in continuing faithful to the true Sabbath, and shows that since Jesus was persecuted for Sabbath-breaking when he was Sabbath-keeping, so when we are persecuted for Sabbath-breaking when we are Sabbath-keeping, we are in "most blessed company."

Will every Sabbath-keeper show his faithfulness by giving this number of the Library at least as wide a circulation as any previous number? Thirty-two pages, price 4 cents; fifty for $1.00.

Orders can be filled at once by the Pacific Press, 43 Bond Street, New York.
