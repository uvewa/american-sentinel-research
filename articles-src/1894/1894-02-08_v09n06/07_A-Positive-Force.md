## A Positive Force.

A WRITER in the News has been discussing the question, "Is Protestantism a mere negation?" The answer to such a question must depend very much upon the signification given to the term "Protestantism." If by that word is meant only what is seen in the most of that worship which differs in form from Catholicism, it may be doubtful whether it is a "mere negation" or not. Certainly a large part of it is not much more than this, and is so rapidly identifying itself with Romanism that it will soon cease to be even that. But if by that term we mean the faith of men like Luther, Wycliffe, and others who in former times earnestly contended against Rome for "the faith once delivered unto the saints," and of the few who are contending in like manner to-day, then the question may be answered with an emphatic negative. Protestantism is not a mere negation, but a positive and most powerful force.

True Protestantism is something very different from a mere denial of the errors of popery. It is a denial of those doctrines, just as truth is always a denial of error, although this is not the proper way to speak of truth. Truth comes first and error afterwards, so that error is a denial of truth, rather than truth a denial of error. And this is all error is; but truth is a positive, living force. It stands alone, beautiful and complete in itself, ignoring all error, and clothed with the power and life of Him who gave it birth.

True Protestantism is the gospel of God. It is "Protestantism" only because of the protest of the princes whose faith led them to stand out against the corrupt communion of Rome. It is a belief, a faith. It was not created by the protest of the princes, but only acquired by that a new name. It existed long before "Protestantism," as a name, was known; long before there was any occasion for such a name. It existed, indeed, from all eternity; for the gospel of God is the "everlasting gospel," being "the power of God, unto salvation to every one that believeth." Rom. 1:16; Rev. 14:6.

The only protest that is needed against Rome's errors is the proclamation of this gospel, this power of God unto salvation. This is the most effective protest that could be made, for the straightforward proclamation of divine truth is the best barrier that can be raised across the path of the error that denies it. The worst thing that can happen for error is to be contrasted with the truth. The worst thing that can happen for popery,—the power of the pope and the priest and the virgin unto salvation,—is to be contrasted with the power of God unto salvation, which is the gospel. This gospel can be proclaimed without any reference to popery whatever, and still be just as strong and effective a protest against it.

But the adherents of the papacy wish to make it appear that Protestantism is something dependent upon popery, a mere denial of the doctrines of popery, and therefore something which could not have existed without it. They wish it to appear that popery was first, and Protestantism came after it. But it is only the name that came after it, and not the principles. Popery is the thing that denies, and not Protestantism. Gospel truth was first in the field; it was there from all eternity. It was preached to the children of Israel in the wilderness (Heb. 4:1, 2); it was preached by the apostles eighteen hundred years ago; it was preached by a faithful few in the Dark Ages; it is preached by the "remnant" of Christ's followers to-day. The gospel is not on the defensive; it does not care for popish innovations; but now, as ever, it calmly and majestically pursues its way to every nation and people and tongue, being "the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth."

The gospel is a positive force; it is an infinite force. Popery cannot stop it, nor any other power that can be brought against it. This is the force which is in the true religion, the true Protestantism. It is a force which lives and works in individuals, in the Word of God which abides in the hearts of Christians. If your religion does not contain this force, it is not the gospel of God. If your heart does not feel this power, if your life does not manifest it, you are not yet in the way of salvation. —Present Truth, London, Eng.
