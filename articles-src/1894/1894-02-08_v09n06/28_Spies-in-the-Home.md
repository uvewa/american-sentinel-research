As noted elsewhere in this paper, the Congregationalist thinks that the custom of giving quiet dinner parties on Sunday evening must cease if the "Sabbath" is to be preserved. This shows the extent to which the Sunday movement is to be carried; spies must intrude into the very homes of the people, in the interest of this pagan-papal day that is to be crammed down the throats of everybody by the National Reform combination backed up by the civil law.
