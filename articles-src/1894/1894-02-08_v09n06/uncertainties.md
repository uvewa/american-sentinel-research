# Uncertainties Log - Volume 9, Number 6 (February 8, 1894)

## OCR Corrections Made

The following corrections were made to resolve clear OCR errors:

1. Page 1: "CALVIN F. BOLLARS" appears in the OCR but should likely be "CALVIN P. BOLLMAN" based on known associate editors. However, the OCR reads "BOLLARS" clearly, so this was preserved as transcribed. Note: Later in the issue, article 12 is signed "C. P. B." and attributed to "Calvin P. Bollman" which confirms the masthead contains an OCR error.

2. Page 2: "ex-priset" corrected to "ex-priest"

3. Page 2: "grached" - uncertain word, possibly OCR error for "lynched" or similar, but preserved as transcribed

4. Page 3: "outcdevation" - uncertain word, appears to be OCR corruption, possibly should be "anti-Christian" or similar based on context

5. Page 4: "newadeslers" appears twice - likely OCR error for "newsdealers"

6. Page 5: Several instances of text at page edges may have minor OCR issues but are generally readable in context

## Notes

- The masthead shows "CALVIN F. BOLLARS" but this is almost certainly an OCR error for "CALVIN P. BOLLMAN" - the associate editor known from other issues
- One article clearly references Boston ministers' resolutions dated "October 2, 1898" which is 4+ years in the future from this 1894 issue - this appears to be either a reprint of resolutions from an earlier year with a typo, or the OCR misread "1893" as "1898"
- Article attributions and author identifications follow known patterns from other 1894 issues
