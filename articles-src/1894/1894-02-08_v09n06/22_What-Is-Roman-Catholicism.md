AN exchange asks: "What is Roman Catholicism?" Let the Scriptures answer: "That man of sin," the "Son of perdition," "That wicked," "The beast," "MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH." Such is Roman Catholicism. And yet it is no worse than the so-called Protestantism that indorses its principles and apes its methods. The papal beast and his image finally share the same fate: "These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone."
