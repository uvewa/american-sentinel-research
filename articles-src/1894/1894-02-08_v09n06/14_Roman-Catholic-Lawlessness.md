APROPOS of the leader in this paper on the subject of Roman Catholic lawlessness, is the following editorial note from the Western Watchman (popish paper published in St. Louis, Mo.):

Mr. Tiernan wrote a very sensible letter to the Kansas City papers on the subject of the McNamara riot. He said the fellow should not be protected by the police. If the substance of his lecture were printed in a newspaper the sheet would be confiscated and its publishers fined. If it were sent through the mails the sender would be put in prison. Why should the police be detailed to protect the speaker, when the writer is clapped in prison? By all means leave the McNamara and the Slattery to the "small boys."

The Watchman's "small boys" are full-grown Roman Catholics, who generally, under the leadership of priests, resort to mob violence when anybody, especially an ex-priest or an ex-nun, goes to telling "tales out of school." These wayward "children of the church" know too much.
