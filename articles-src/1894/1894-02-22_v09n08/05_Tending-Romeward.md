FATHER HUNTINGTON, of New York, came here two weeks ago to conduct a mission, which closed to-day. He claims the Episcopal Church is the true Catholic Church—the American Catholic Church—and seems to think that the confessional is necessary. He does not exact compulsory confession, but he commends and advises it and himself assumes the functions of a priest as the mediator between the sinner and his Saviour. So far only ladies have attended the confessional, and these have usually been young ones.

The introduction of the confessional has caused no little consternation among the Episcopalians. "If we are to go over to Romanism, I believe in doing it at once and being frank about it," said a member of the church. "We can get a monk from Vine Street at a moment's notice who carries a stouter flagellation cord than Father Huntington ever dare to wear. Our Catholic friends are glad to welcome us, doubtless, but if we are to be with them I want at least the credit of going frankly and fairly to them and acknowledging that they are wholly right and we are partly wrong. I am satisfied we are in danger, and I am afraid it will not wholly subside when our missionary friends have gone." A young married woman remarked: "I think it is perfectly right that we should tell our troubles and naughty deeds to some one who can sympathize with us and extend spiritual consolation. I know when we do wrong we feel better when we tell some one about it."
