IN "The Faith of Our Fathers," page 264, Cardinal Gibbons thus defines religious liberty:—

> A man enjoys religious liberty when he possesses the free right of worshiping God according to the dictates of a right conscience, and of practicing that form of religion most in accordance with his duties to God.

But what is "a right conscience"? and what form of religion is it which is "most in accordance with his duties to God"? Let the cardinal's own book answer:—

> If, as we have seen, the church has authority from God to teach, and if she teaches nothing but the truth, is it not the duty of all Christians to hear her voice and obey her commands? She is the organ of the Holy Ghost. She is the representative of Jesus Christ, who has said to her; "He that heareth you heareth me; he that despiseth you, despiseth me." She is mistress of truth. It is the property of the human mind to embrace the truth wherever it finds it. It would, therefore, be not only an act of irreverence, but of sheer folly to disobey the voice of this ever-truthful mother.
>
> If a citizen is bound to obey the laws of his country, though those laws may not in all respects be conformable to strict justice, if the child is bound by the natural and divine law to obey his mother, though she may sometimes err in her judgments, how much more strictly are we obliged to be docile to the teachings of the Catholic Church, our mother, whose admonitions are always just, whose precepts are immutable!—The Faith of Our Fathers, pages 95, 96.

In the light of this pronunciamento what does the cardinal mean by "the dictates of a right conscience"?—Simply a conscience instructed by the Catholic Church. And what by "that form of religion most in accordance with his duties to God"?—The Roman Catholic religion, certainly. Then what, in reality, is his definition of religious liberty?—Simply this: "A man enjoys religious liberty when he possesses the free right to worship God according to the dictates of a conscience instructed by the Catholic Church, and of practicing the Roman Catholic religion"!! And yet "Protestants" there are who believe that Cardinal Gibbons is remarkably liberal, that he is in fact a friend and defender of religious liberty! And so he is—let him define that liberty. But it is the "liberty" of the dungeon, the rack and the fagot.
