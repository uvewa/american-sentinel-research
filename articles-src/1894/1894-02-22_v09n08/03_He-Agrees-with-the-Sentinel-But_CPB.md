As the following letter is short, and we have the consent of the gentleman who sends it to make whatever use of it we see fit, we print it for comment:—

> AMERICAN SENTINEL:—A friend handed me your No. 1, Vol. 9, and I have read it with attention—agreeing most heartily with it in its decided hostility to the connection of Church and State—not only hostility to the Established Church systems in Europe, but to any movement in these highly favored free American United States which is made in harmony with the principle of such church establishments. I differ from it, however, in the leading illustration in its columns, viz.: that the seventh day is the proper religious rest day of the present dispensation, for I am persuaded that to all believers in the risen Christ by whom "life and immortality have been brought to light," the first day of the week should ever be to them the memorial day of joy and rejoicing, and especially devoted to his service. But why not regard the law of creation over all mankind as best observed by a seventh part of time for rest? And this being so, then it is but the duty of all civil governments of common sense to have a day of rest from labor and business for their people. Thus, in the year of our Lord 1894, let the law of the civil power abide by its legal day of rest. And although those who abide by "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus" are "free from the law of sin and death," yet none the less as Christian citizens they may support the civil authority in secular affairs so long as it is a terror to evil doers, and a protection to well doers.

> The many insidious movements towards State-churchism are to-day as cancerous to the fundamental principle of our civil government, as would be similar movements towards the restoration of slavery where local majorities prevail. The politicians of all parties should watch to defend this fundamental principle of the civil government of our country, viz: No Church and State connection. But what can we expect of many among us who inherit the Church and State establishment principle so long dominant in Europe, and who would, if they could, welcome it here? Such are the Romanists, the Lutherans, Episcopalians, and Presbyterians who may consistently accept State favors; but look at the Daily News Almanac of 1893, and see many others who swallow some of the Indian school fund. Congregationalists, Friends, Unitarians, and Methodists; all these partake; but old madam Rome got, in eight years, about a million more dollars than all others together! Rome got $2,366,416, all other schools, institutes, and churches received only $1,408,537. But this is only one case of grab! For the exemption of church property from taxes seems to be welcomed by all the denominations. I know of none who reject it (except a Baptist Church in Toronto). To accept exemption from taxes imposes the amount on the people; but Jesus paid taxes to the civil government and told his disciples to do so, and never accepted nor authorized his Church or apostles to take State payments. To do so is akin to the sin of Achan, who took of the accursed things—akin to the sin of Gehazi, who disobeyed his master Elisha—akin to the sin of Judas, the covetous apostle, whose bag was probably as much in need as the sects in our country. Leprosy and death were the penalties, and so it is spiritually with churches seduced by State favors. The true bride of Christ must keep herself pure, and his soldiers must be loyal to the instructions of their divine Master, the risen Lord Jesus Christ for the conquest of the world.

The questions raised in this communication are interesting, and, like all questions pertaining to our duty toward God, are worthy of careful consideration.

The query, "Why not regard the law of Creation over all mankind as best observed by a seventh part of time for rest?" admits the existence of a divine law of rest; and that law is the fourth commandment of the Decalogue. But for that law man would know nothing of a seventh part of time for rest, for no people have ever had a weekly Sabbath without first having a knowledge of the divine law.

The writer does not believe that physical rest is the primary object of the Sabbath; it is memorial rather than utilitarian in character. True it "was made for man," but does that necessarily mean that it was primarily for his physical good? When was it made for man?—In the beginning before man stood in need of rest from wearing toil; and we learn from Isa. 66:22,23 that it will be observed by man in the redeemed state, when "there shall be no more curse," and consequently no wearing toil to render necessary stated periods of physical rest.

Regarding the Sabbath as memorial rather than economic, it is at once apparent that it necessarily attaches itself to the event of which it is a memorial. In such a case to change the day is to change the reason for its observance, and to establish another institution. Thus we have Sunday observed instead of the original Sabbath because Christ rose from the dead on that day, and not because God rested on that day from the work of creation. It is a different day, observed for a different reason; and is essentially a different institution.

But granting, for the sake of the argument only, that the Sabbath is for rest, what do we find?—A very general insistence, by those who would make it a subject of civil law, on the proposition that uniformity of observance is essential to rest; that is that all must rest at the same time. It is often expressed in this sentence: "The right of rest for one is the law of rest for all." But this most emphatically negatives the seventh-part-of-time theory; for "the law of the Lord is perfect;" and if that law was designed to give man a Sabbath for physical rest, and if uniformity be essential to such rest, the law must of necessity be definite, not only as to the exact proportion of time but as to the precise portion of time to be devoted to rest. But surely an all-wise God never left indefinite so important a matter as the definite time of the Sabbath. Viewed from either standpoint, definite time is an essential element in the Sabbath law; and it is absolutely certain that God put it into that law, for he says: 'The seventh day is the Sabbath;' and again, Moses said to the Hebrew hosts: 'To-morrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath.' And again at the crucifixion we have this testimony concerning the holy women that "they returned and prepared spices and ointments, and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment."

The second question is dependent upon the first. But in any event it would not be the duty of civil government to do more than to recognize the right of people to rest whenever they wished to do so. Any government may set apart holidays making them dies non, but whoever heard of an enforced holiday, other than Sunday? The Fourth of July and other days are legal holidays, but whoever heard of any one being arraigned before a police justice and fined for not observing the Fourth of July or Washington's birthday? It is only the religious idea that gives rise to laws forbidding not only work but play on Sunday. No government has a right to confiscate the time of its citizens any more than it has to confiscate their money or other property, though it may decree that at certain times men shall not be required to do business or to perform labor unless they wish to do so. But this is only to make a holiday, not a holy day. And no Sunday law advocate would be satisfied with such a law as that. It is the day that is to be protected, not the people.

Another element enters into this question, namely, the element of conscience. While very many people have no scruples about resting on Sunday, some regard the fourth commandment not only as forbidding labor on the seventh day, but as, inferentially at least, forbidding the observance of any other day in a similar manner.

Every law must show in some way the authority by which it was enacted, and this the Decalogue does only in the fourth commandment. In that precept it is declared that the Giver of the law is he who created the heavens and the earth in six days and rested on the seventh. It is this fact that gives the Sabbath its memorial character. The Sabbath commandment is in fact the seal of the divine law, because it is the precept that designates the Giver of the law, and states the ground of his authority to require obedience.

In like manner the Sunday institution is the seal or mark of a rival power. It is set forth by the papacy, the "man of sin" of 2 Thess. 2:3, as the badge of his authority to command men under sin. In a Catholic catechism, called the "Abridgment of Christian Doctrine," the Catholic Church asserts its power to change the divine law, in the following manner:—

> Question. How prove you that the church hath power to command feasts and holy days?
>
> Answer. By the very act of changing the Sabbath into Sunday, which Protestants allow of; and therefore they fondly contradict themselves by keeping Sunday strictly, and breaking most other feasts commanded by the same church.
>
> Q. How prove you that?
>
> A. Because by keeping Sunday they acknowledge the church's power to ordain feasts, and to command them under sin; and by not keeping the rest by her commanded, they again deny, in fact, the same power.

Another Catholic "Doctrinal Catechism," offers the following as proof that Protestants are not guided by the Scriptures:—

> Q. Have you any other way of proving that the church has power to institute festivals of precept?
>
> A. Had she not such power, she could not have done that in which all modern religionists agree with her;—she could not have substituted the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for the observance of Saturday, the seventh day, a change for which there is no scriptural authority.
>
> Q. When Protestants do profane work upon Saturday, or the seventh day of the week, do they follow the Scripture as their only rule of faith—do they find this permission clearly laid down in the sacred volume?
>
> A. On the contrary, they have only the authority of tradition for this practice. In profaning Saturday, they violate one of God's commandments, which he has never clearly abrogated.—"Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day."

It is evident that with those who believe Sunday to be a rival of the Lord's Sabbath, the badge of papal authority, its observance would be equivalent to rendering homage to antichrist; hence their steady refusal to obey Sunday laws, and the willingness of some to suffer imprisonment, the chain-gang, and even death itself rather than to so much as appear to regard Sunday as other than a common working day. It is not as some seem to regard it, simply a matter of the choice of days, but is with many a vital question directly affecting their salvation.
