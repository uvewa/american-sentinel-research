MEMBERS of churches and Christian societies are uniting for political action. This spring candidates for election or re-election will have to reckon on the votes controlled by the Christian citizenship campaign movement as well as those of the Democrats and Republicans. While the greater part of these votes will be drawn from the Republican and Democratic parties they will be used solidly for the candidates the movement decides to support.

The movement is now well started, and March 4 will see from three hundred to five hundred meetings in its behalf being held in the various churches of the city. For about three weeks the idea has been talked over among the leaders of the different Christian societies. They have become convinced that the only way to secure good officials and good government is to elect clean men for the offices. Campaign promises, they declare, have been tried and found wanting. The people who are interested in the movement also claim that the only way to make the politician feel the power of the Christian organizations is through the ballot, and they intend to proceed in that direction until a radical change has been worked in municipal affairs.

Edwin D. Wheelock, well known in temperance and religious circles, is one of the prime movers in the organization of the Christian citizenship campaign. He has been working for some time and now reports that about thirty thousand votes would attest to the power of the movement next spring. "It is not our intention," said Mr. Wheelock, "to form a new party. We simply organize to stimulate and educate the public conscience in such matters. We understand that no results can be obtained by simply talking. Politicians understand that talk does not put votes into the ballot-box, so before election they smile at what we say and after election do what they please. We vote for them just the same. The united young people's societies will be the working force of the new movement. At the present time the Christian Endeavor societies, the Epworth League, the Baptist Young People's Union and the Young People's Christian Union have promised to join the movement heart and soul. We have not heard from the Young Men's Christian Association or the St. Andrew Brotherhood, but we believe they will assist us. We muster about thirty thousand members, and I believe that when these begin to work in their homes the number of votes controlled will be much larger.

"We will open the campaign on Sunday, March 4. On that night politics will be the theme of from three hundred to five hundred prayer meetings which are held in this city. It will be the biggest meeting of its kind ever held. Probably more people that night will hear the plans of the Christian citizen campaign than ever a political speaker addressed in one meeting. The following week probably one hundred meetings will be held in different parts of the city. Professors Small, Henderson and Bemis have already promised to take the stump for the campaign. They will be assisted by a large number of students who are interested in the movement. In addition J. G. Wooley and W. T. Mills will make a large number of addresses.

"The glee clubs from the different organizations which have joined the movement will make the meetings the more attractive with their music.

"While a great deal of work will be done at the public meetings I dare say the most effective efforts will be made at home. Wives and daughters will enlist their husbands and brothers in behalf of the reputable candidates. I believe a promise, even a political one, which is made to a wife or sister is much more liable to be kept than if it is made to some stranger. It is from this fact that we believe our strength will be greater than the number of those actually taking part in the movement.

"After next spring and after the Christian campaign has been tried we will aspire to greater things. We aim, in time, to exterminate the saloon, to prevent the election of corrupt candidates and the enactment of corrupt laws. We want trusty officers to purify and elevate the elective franchise, and to preserve the American Sabbath. These things cannot be secured except through the ballot, and we have made the first step in that direction."—Chicago Record, Feb. 8.
