Some have written us saying that the two articles which appeared recently in the SENTINEL, "The Limits of Civil Authority from the Standpoint of Natural Right," and "The Limits of Civil Authority from the Standpoint of Divine Obligation," ought to be printed in tract form. They have been. No. 13 of the Religious Liberty Library contains in a single tract the two articles.
