It was a rather ludicrous blunder into which Senator Voorhees fell, recently, in an attempt to gain a little cheap favor with the Catholics. The facts are thus stated in a Washington dispatch of February 8:—

> Senator Voorhees made a bad break to-day, which is exciting a great deal of amusement. He made the motion that the Senate adjourn until Monday, and gave as his reason that to-morrow will be Good Friday, "yesterday was Ash Wednesday," he said, "and there is no reason why we should not observe Good Friday." None of the senators appeared to know that Voorhees was wrong, and the motion prevailed.

Of course such a blunder was the occasion of general newspaper comment, but the following editorial note from the Philadelphia Times of the 9th inst., is about as pertinent as anything that we have seen:—

> The Senate, it appears, is not well up in the ecclesiastical calendar. Having read in yesterday's papers that the day before was Ash Wednesday, the Senate, on motion of Mr. Voorhees, adjourned over to-day in order to observe Good Friday! No doubt a Lent of four days instead of forty would be widely popular, especially among young people, but it may be questioned whether a decree of the Senate would be sufficient to effect this reform.

Of course this action of the Senate can have no effect on the Lenten season in this case; but suppose there were a division of opinion in this matter and likewise in practice, and suppose that the adjournment had been had with special reference to committing the Government to one side of the controversy; it at once becomes apparent how improper such action would be. And yet that is exactly what was done a few months ago in the matter of the Sunday controversy. Congress conditioned an appropriation upon the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, for the express purpose of committing the Government to the cause of Sunday sacredness. The time long since foretold by the National Reformers has come when politicians are tumbling over each other in their haste to secure front seats in the "reform" car, and some ludicrous, and even disgusting, sights will certainly be witnessed.
