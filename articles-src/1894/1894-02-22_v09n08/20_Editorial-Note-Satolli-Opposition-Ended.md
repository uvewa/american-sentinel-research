UNDER date of February 11, the United Press correspondent in Rome sent out this dispatch:—

> The opposition to Archbishop Satolli, Apostolic Delegate to the Catholic Church in the United States, is ended. The pope was inflexible, and declared that he always would support Archbishop Satolli to accentuate his American policy.

American Catholics may not like Satolli, that is, they may, and we believe, do, object to being ruled absolutely by an imported Italian ecclesiastic, but they will submit. Rome brooks no independence.
