# Uncertainties Log - Volume 9, Number 8 (February 22, 1894)

## OCR Corrections Made

The following OCR errors were corrected during transcription:

### Page 1
- Line 23: "BORN STREET" appears in the OCR, but this is likely "BOND STREET" based on known publication information. However, I preserved "BORN" as it appears in the scan.
- Line 27: "ALOREO T. JONES" should be "ALONZO T. JONES" (corrected)
- Line 29: "CALVIN F. BOLLHAY" should be "CALVIN P. BOLLMAN" (corrected)

### Page 2
- Line 105: "fitly" may be "fifty" but context suggests "fitly" is correct

### Page 3
- Line 154: "Daily News Absence" appears to be an OCR error for "Daily News Almanac" (corrected based on context)

## General Notes

- The masthead information contains minor OCR errors that were corrected based on known publication details
- All other text was preserved as it appeared in the OCR output
- Author initials were identified and full names assigned based on known contributors to the American Sentinel
- One author "C. F. Wilcox" (CFW) was identified from the signature at the end of the article "Rome's New Policy"
