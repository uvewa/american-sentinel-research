[Under the heading, "Federating the Churches," we made some mention last week of this movement. This is simply another chapter in its history as given by the State Republican, Lansing, Mich., February 3. We have added in brackets after the names the denomination to which the several gentlemen belong.]

THE preliminary meeting of the federate council of the churches of the city of Lansing was held last evening at St. Paul's parish rooms, and was greatly successful. A large number of the churches were represented by clerical and lay delegates.

Rev. W. H. Osborne [Episcopal], under whose influence the plan originated, called the assembly to order and stated the object of the meeting. A plan of organization was then presented and adopted similar to that which had been originally formulated by its promoter with the addition of several new articles. Under this constitution the council elected Rev. W. H. Osborne, president, and Justice P. H. Dolan [Catholic], secretary and treasurer for one year.

A committee was elected, consisting of the president, Revs. C. H. Beale [Congregationalist], H. S. Jordan [Presbyterian], Father Slattery [Catholic priest], and Justice Grant of the supreme bench, to provide a scheme of operation and plan of action. The committee will report at the next meeting, which will be held on the first Friday in March, at 8 o'clock P. M., in St. Paul's parish rooms.

The primary object of the council, as has been previously stated in these columns, is to apply the principles of Christianity to the entire life of the city; not an interference with affairs, but an application of all that is best to the things of daily routine. It is a plan to apply the principles of Christianity to the corporate life of the city, its industries, its politics, its amusements, its everything.

Every church will have an equal representation, no matter what difference there may be in regard to the size or membership. The delegates from each church will consist of one clerical and two lay. There are some seventeen churches in the city, and should all be represented in the federate council it would make a body of fifty-one persons. Such a body of representative men from the various churches, laying aside the little differences in religious beliefs, and coming together for deliberation on the relation of the church to passing civic events, cannot but wield a great power.
