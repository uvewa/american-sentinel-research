The hearing on the proposed "Christian" amendment before the House Committee on the Judiciary, will be held March 6, instead of March 13, as stated last week. Our representative in Washington was informed by the secretary of the committee that the hearing would be March 13, but it seems it has been definitely fixed for another date. We do not know what step will be taken, if any, by opposers of the amendment to defeat it.
