A COLPORTERS' school and Bible institute lately held by Seventh-day Adventists at Atlanta, Ga., was attended by more than one hundred and sixty missionary workers from every State south of the Ohio River and east of the Mississippi. Five colporters were in attendance who walked from two hundred to two hundred and sixty miles that they might receive the benefit of the meeting. All whose fields of labor were such that they could avail themselves of transportation by any of the lines of the Richmond and Danville systems were given the most liberal rates possible and treated with the utmost courtesy by the officials of that road. The uniform kindness and consideration met with by this people in the matter of railroad transportation is in marked contrast with the suspicion, prejudice and persecution which they so often have to meet among the community at large.
