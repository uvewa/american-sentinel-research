THE Lutheran Standard thus states the position of Lutherans on the school question:—

> It should be distinctly understood that the Lutheran Church does not make any demands upon the State for any support for her parochial schools. There is no opposition to the public schools from the ranks of the Lutheran Church. We recognize their necessity, and when we can do no better we use the advantages they afford. When, however, we can give our children a Christian training by establishing and supporting a Christian school, no one in this land of the free has any right to forbid it. Any interference on the part of the State would be in violation of the national Constitution.

This is the correct position. The church that occupies it stands on solid ground.
