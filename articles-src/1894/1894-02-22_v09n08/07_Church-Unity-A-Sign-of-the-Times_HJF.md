DR. LYMAN BEECHER is quoted as saying: "There is a state of society to be formed by an extensive combination of institutions, religious, civil, and literary, which never exists without the cooperation of an educated ministry."

Charles Beecher once said:—

> Thus are the ministry of the evangelical Protestant denominations not only formed all the way up under a tremendous pressure of merely human fear, but they live, and move, and breathe, in a state of things radically corrupt, and appealing every hour to every baser element in their nature to hush up the truth and bow the knee to the power of apostasy. Was not this the way things went in Rome? Are we not living her life over again? And what do we see just ahead? Another general council! A world's convention! Evangelical Alliance, and a universal creed.

These words were written many years ago, though perhaps not from a prophetic standpoint, but reasoning from cause to effect. The Beechers saw that we were about to live over again the life of Rome; and why? because the "ministry" were living under "a tremendous pressure" of "human fear," bowing the "knee to the power of apostasy." And what have we seen since these words were spoken? A "general council," "an Evangelical Alliance," a "world's convention" in Chicago in 1893; and all we wait for is a "universal creed." It will not be long before we have this at the rate things are now moving.

In reporting a meeting of the "Churchman's Club," held in Providence, R. I., Dec. 21, 1893, the Daily Bulletin, of the same city, Dec. 22, gives the following noticeable heading:—

> Christian Unity.—Last Night's Meeting of Churchman's Club a Notable Event.—Bishop John J. Keane [of the Catholic University at Washington], the guest of the Evening.—An Eloquent Exposition of the Tenets of the Roman Catholic Faith.—Addresses by Dr. Brown, of the Union Theological Seminary, [Presbyterian], and Dr. Anderson, of Providence, R. I., Pastor of the Central Baptist Church.

It is a "notable event," as the paper states, when "high dignitaries of such differing creeds as the Roman Catholic, Baptist and Presbyterian" come together to discuss "Christian unity," and that upon a Catholic basis and led by a Catholic bishop who talks to them over an hour, "holding the attention of the club without a break by his impressive delivery and eloquent word-painting;" setting before them the Catholic idea of "church unity." The most notable event to us is President Gardner's statement of the purpose of the Churchman's Club, which is made up of "Episcopalian laymen, for the purpose of developing Christian fellowship . . . in our and other churches;" and of the object of that night's meeting, he said, "We hope to hear a perfectly free and frank statement of their views, given without restraint. . . . We feel that soft words and flattery will be of no interest to us who desire to know the true way to Christian unity." And they got their "desire" clear and plain from a Catholic standpoint, "the true way to [Catholic] Christian unity," as we shall see. Bishop Clark said:—

> We are most grateful to these gentlemen who have come here to speak to us to-night, and upon whom we have no claim except that we are workers in a common cause, . . . toward Christian unity.

So the bishop considers himself with the other so-called Protestant churches to be "laborers" with the Catholic Church in a "common cause toward Christian unity." And as the Catholic Church boasts that she never changes, and they are looking to her to "know the true way to Christian unity," what kind of a unity will they get?—A Roman Catholic unity and none other.

And this is just what the Catholic bishop gave them. After telling them in a very pretty way Christ's desire for unity in the Church, and how Paul labored to this end, he set forth Peter as the rock upon which the Church was built instead of Christ, thus making Peter the foundation of the Church; and Rome, the supreme see, "the see of Peter," from which descended an apostolic line of popes, who were the head of the Church and the center around which all unity exists. As long as all acknowledged the headship at Rome things went smoothly on until, as the bishop says, the East separated from the West because the Church would not recognize Constantinople as the second see instead of Alexandria, which the see of Peter refused to do; and so a division occurred. "Then," said the bishop, "in the sixteenth century, was started a movement by priests. They said that the episcopate of Rome was not essential to the church. Not only two sacraments did they deny, but the presence of the body in the Eucharist. England believed otherwise. Henry VIII. won his title 'Defender of the Faith,' for writing in defense of the seven sacraments against Luther and Calvin. . . . Here is the condition of things in the world to-day. From the separations of Germany, Switzerland and England, there have arisen the many various bodies that are such a cause of grief to the mother church."

It is plain to be seen that what is "such a cause of grief to the mother church," is the separation of the East from the West, and the work of Luther and Calvin which resulted in so many throwing off the Roman yoke and becoming free men and women in the Lord Jesus Christ, acknowledging him to be their head instead of the pope of Rome. How much Rome has grieved over this and is now making pathetic cry in the ears of Protestants, at their demand too! And how long will it be before the daughters will return to the mother, and this Scripture be fulfilled—"And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him [the papal beast], whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world"? Rev. 13:8. Is there not a need for some one to be proclaiming the three messages of Rev. 14:6-12? which is the preaching of the "everlasting gospel," Jesus Christ and him crucified, the power of God" and "the wisdom of God." The only "name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved." Why does not the Churchman's Club go to Jesus Christ and the Bible to learn the true way to Christian unity instead of bowing "the knee to the power of apostasy" and going to Rome to "know the true way to Christian unity"? Is not all the world and worldly churches going after the beast, when they call for a World's Columbian Exposition of Religions, and a Catholic cardinal with other leading Catholic dignitaries taking the leading part in the deliberations of the gathering? Does not this show that all the world is going after the beast, and that too, at the instigation of the churches, as they call for State and national legislation in matters of religion? Surely "Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication." And the Lord says, "Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities." . . .
