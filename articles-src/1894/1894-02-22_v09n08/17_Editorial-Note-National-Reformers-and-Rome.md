It is said that "republics are ungrateful;" but be that as it may, Roman Catholics certainly are: for, notwithstanding all that the National Reformers have done for Romanism in this country, the Catholic Standard says:—

> If the meddlesome Protestant ministers who are bothering poor congressmen in Washington about having an amendment adopted, putting God into the Constitution, were to put more of His principles into their sermons and lives, it would be better for themselves, their congregations, if they have any worth talking about, and the country at large.

If that is not base ingratitude what is it? It is almost as unkind as to remind "Protestants," and Rome is not backward about doing that, that aside from popish tradition there is absolutely no authority for Sunday-keeping. It would seem that so far as Rome's appreciation is concerned, National Reformers have "labored in vain and brought forth for trouble."
