"Go," said the emperor to his courier, "and direct that all those who hold beliefs at variance with the State be thrown into prison. And, by the way, stop at the treasury department on your way out and instruct my chancellor of the exchequer that the new issue of coins be stamped with the image of Liberty, that thus we may please the populace."—Kate Field's Washington.

Query: Did Miss Field have in mind when she wrote this, the religious bigotry and intolerance manifesting itself in this country and to which the Government is lending itself, while at the same time professing to conserve the very liberty of conscience which it is certainly using its influence to destroy; and that at the behest of a small proportion of the people, who, however, assumes to be the populace?
