IN November last, Elder W. A. McCutchen, pastor of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Gainesville, Ga., and Professor E. C. Keck, teacher of the Seventh-day Adventist school in the same place, were arrested for working on Sunday, and brought before the Mayor's Court of the city of Gainesville. The charge made against them was that of disorderly conduct. This was because there was no local ordinance applicable to the case. The "disorderly conduct" consisted in the doing of carpenter work, on Sunday, in the Seventh-day Adventist Church building. The special work done was the making of seats for the little children who attended the school held in the same building during the week. They were convicted under this charge, in the Mayor's Court, and fined fifty dollars each, and costs. An appeal was taken to the higher court. In the meantime an indictment was found against them under the State law, and when the appeal case came up it was returned for re-appeal on technical pleas, which, although non-essential, the court saw fit to consider sufficient cause for sending the case back. This action postpones the Mayor's Court case for six months, while the trial under the indictment for the breaking of the State Sunday law comes up at the term of court beginning the third Monday in February. It is hardly possible that there is any intention of subjecting these men to two trials for the same offense, so it is reasonable to suppose that the action taken in the Mayor's Court case is for the purpose of getting that out of the way to make room for the indictment and trial under the State law. This indictment reads as follows:—

> State of Georgia, Hall County. In the Superior Court of said county.
>
> The grand jurors, selected, chosen and sworn for the County of Hall, to wit: [Here follow the names of the grand jurors].
>
> In the name and behalf of the citizens of Georgia, charge and accuse W. A. McCutchen and E. C. Keck, of the county and State aforesaid, with the offense of misdemeanor, for that the said W. A. McCutchen and E. C. Keck on the 18th day of November, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and ninety-three, in the county aforesaid, with force and arms, did unlawfully them and there as a laborer, artificer, and as workmen, work on and in the Seventh-day Adventist Church with planes, hammers, hand-saws and other tools (carpenters' tools) on said 19th day of November, 1893, the same being the Lord's day, said labor not being works of necessity or charity, contrary to the laws of said State, the good order, peace and dignity thereof.
>
> Superior Court, said county, January term, 1894.

That portion of the Georgia code under which this indictment is brought reads as follows:—

> Section 4579. Violating Sabbath. Any tradesman, artificer, workman or laborer, or other person whatever, who shall pursue their business or work of their ordinary callings on the Lord's day (works of necessity or charity only excepted), shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction, shall be punished as prescribed in section 4310 of this code.

The punishment prescribed in this section is—

> A fine not to exceed one thousand dollars, imprisonment not to exceed six months, to work in the chain-gang not to exceed twelve months, and any one or more of these punishments may be ordered, in the discretion of the judge.

These men did the work with which they are charged. They would, on no account, deny or attempt to disprove it. They are honorable, Christian men, and good citizens. They are gentlemen of education and ability. They possess by birth and heritage those finer qualities which so often characterize the gentlemen of the South,—yet a law of their State puts it within the power of the judge of the superior court of Hall County to impose upon each of them the combined penalties of one thousand dollars fine, six months' imprisonment, and twelve months in the chain-gang. Is it credible that the citizens of Hall County, of the State of Georgia, of the United States of America,—for all are implicated in the shame of this,—are blind to the iniquity of a law which makes possible such a thing as this? It makes no difference what the result of this particular case may be, whether the penalty affixed by the court in this individual instance be light or heavy, or even if on some technical ground they be allowed to go free,—the principle remains the same, and the iniquity is there, so long as the law stands. This matter is up and it will not down while time lasts.

But the end of the Georgia law on this subject has not yet been reached. If these men are convicted they become convicts, and of their disposition by the authorities the Georgia code says in section 4814:—

> In all cases where persons are convicted of misdemeanor, and sentenced to work in the chain-gang on the public works, or public roads, or when such persons are confined in jail for non-payment of fines imposed for such misdemeanor, the ordinary of the county, and where there is a board of commissioners of roads and revenues of the counties, then said board of commissioners, and in those counties where there is a county judge, then the said county judge, where said conviction was had, or where such convicts may be confined, may place such convicts, in the county or elsewhere, to work upon such public works of the county, in chain-gangs, or otherwise, or hire out such convicts, upon such terms and restrictions as may subserve the ends of justice, and place such convicts under such guards as may be necessary for their safe keeping.

It will be seen that this opens a remarkable opportunity for general dealing in convict labor. That this has been fully taken advantage of is evident from the facts stated in a very thorough article on this subject, published in the Atlanta Journal of February 6. In this article it is stated that three companies, which mutually own stock each in the other and really form one combine, hold a contract with the State of Georgia, by which the State agrees—

> to let them have all her convicts for $25,000 a year, the companies paying all the expenses, such as feeding, clothing, and guarding the convicts, and also the expense incident to sickness.

These three companies are the Dade Coal Company, Penitentiary Company No. 2, and Penitentiary Company No. 3. The Chattahoochee Brick Company also owns fifty per cent. of the stock of Company No. 2, and thirty-one and a quarter per cent. of the stock of Company No. 3.

According to this article it would seem that the convicts are worked at the Dade Coal and Iron mines, and in making brick for the Chattahoochee Brick Company. But there being a glut in the brick market, and the law requiring the convicts to be kept at work, other means were taken to keep them employed, and they have been sublet to numerous individuals and corporations for different kinds of work. Some of these ventures have proved failures, entailing large losses on the original companies, while they are still bound to feed, clothe, guard, and provide medical treatment for their charge. This contract runs until 1899, and as they claim to be making continual losses, it cannot be expected that they will undertake any expense for food, clothing and medical care which they can avoid. It would seem that this system of letting and subletting, together with the present financial condition of those having control of them, would make the life and death of the Georgia convicts a matter of great uncertainty. The chain-gang and the stockade, with their accessories of bloodhounds and armed guards, and overseers vested with large authority, do not seem to be in themselves the highest development of penal methods; but when the law subjects Christian men to the possibility of all this ignominy and hardship, what can be said of the law? and is it possible that the eyes of those who are called upon to enforce such a law will not be opened to its character?

But even this is not all the possibilities of this law. Section 4821 of the code treats of insurrection, and says:—

> Whenever any convict or convicts now confined or hereafter to be confined, in the penitentiary of this State, or member or members of the chain-gang now confined, or hereafter to be confined in the penitentiary of this State, or wherever else employed as such, shall be guilty of insurrection or attempt at insurrection, such convict or convicts or member or members of the chain-gang shall, upon trial and conviction in the superior court of the county in which the crime is committed, be deemed guilty of a capital offense, and punished with death, or such other punishment as the judge, in his discretion, may inflict.

What is the meaning of this word "insurrection," as used here, in which one man or many may be engaged? Does it mean insubordination, refusal to obey orders? In that case what under this law may be the fate of Christian men like these now about to be put in jeopardy, when they refuse to work in the chain-gang on the "seventh day which is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God"? It is well that these things be thought of in time by those who are to assume the responsibility of them.

But still the code carries this one point farther yet:—

> Section 6382. Fines for violation of the Sabbath. All moneys arising from fines imposed for offenses, the gist of which consists in their being committed on the Sabbath day, shall be paid to the ordinary of the county, to be by him distributed for the purpose of establishing and promoting Sabbath schools in the county.

No language within the bounds of common restraint of expression can justly characterize the inconsistency, the religious fallacy, in this statute. Can it be that these strange survivals of mediæval error are still to remain, be cherished and enforced, as public evidence of the allegiance of the body politic to Deity? What Deity requires such service as this, from such a source?
