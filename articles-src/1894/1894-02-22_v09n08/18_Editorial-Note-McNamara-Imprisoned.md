As noted in these columns last week, McNamara, the anti-Catholic lecturer and agitator, has been sentenced to one year's imprisonment and to pay a fine of $500. The Western Watchman (Catholic) says:—

> He will get more of the same medicine before the Missouri courts get through with him. We are glad to think that the jury that convicted the arch-slanderer was composed exclusively of Protestants. Father Dalton deserves the thanks of every Catholic in the country for having sent the arch-scoundrel, McNamara, to jail.

We do not know all the facts in this case, but on the face of it it appears to be an outrage on free-speech. The fact that the jury was composed of "Protestants" is no guarantee that justice was done. There are "Protestants" and Protestants. A jury of the former would be no better than a jury of Catholics, if as good, for "corrupted freemen are the worst of slaves."
