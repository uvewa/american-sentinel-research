[In 1820 there was organized in West Middletown, Washington Co., Pa., a society, called the West Middletown Moral Society. The principal object of the society was to enforce the Pennsylvania Sunday law of 1794, which is still on the statute books of the State. This Moral Society was organized by the United Presbyterians, the same people who, later in 1863, organized the National Reform Association. Alexander Campbell, the founder of the Christian or Disciple Church, also opposed the society in a series of articles published in the Reporter, of Washington, county seat of Washington County. His articles were signed "Candidus." A United Presbyterian minister, by the name of Wylie, attempted to defend the society, and signed himself "Timothy." The discussion continued from April 17, 1820, the date of Mr. Campbell's first article, to February 22, 1822, during which time almost every phase of the compulsory Sunday law question was treated. As a result the Moral Society perished, not to appear again until 1863 when it was revived by the same denomination under the name, National Reform Association. Every word of Mr. Campbell's invincible logic and withering denunciation is applicable to the association, resuscitated under the name, National Reform Association, and kindred organizations, such as the American Sabbath Union, the Pennsylvania Sabbath Association, etc.]

The appointment of civil government, and of the church, are divine institutions, and intended for the good of mankind; the one to promote his temporal, the other his eternal good. The one to minister to his fleshly comforts, the other to advance his spiritual interests. They both emanate from the same fountain of authority, and were dictated from the same principles of philanthropy. They are, however, as distinct as soul and body, and should be considered as distinct in their nature, properties and operations. The office of the civil magistrate has existed in all countries, with and without an established religion. Savage nations, Mohammedans, pagans and Christians, have their civil magistrates, and amongst all such the office is a divine ordinance. Where there is and where there is not a church, the ordinance is the same. In Rome the constituted governor and magistracy, though heathen, and persecuting Christianity, was called, in Paul's time, even when a Nero and a Domitian sat on the throne, "an ordinance of God," by that spirit that can denominate nothing wrong. Yes, in the New Testament the heathen magistrates are called "God's ministers," and he that resisteth them is said "not to resist man but God." Yes, the civil magistrate in all nations upon earth is appointed of God, "to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil" to his neighbor, and to be a terror to evil doers, and a praise to them that do well. For this purpose, he bears the sword of power, and is invested with authority. He is in the same record which denominates him a minister of God, to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil, prohibited from using his authority, which is always compulsory, in anything pertaining to spiritual concerns. For this purpose the sword of power is never to be unsheathed. It was once wielded for this purpose even in the presence of the Founder of Christianity, but it was returned to its scabbard, with these memorable and instructive words: "All that take the sword shall perish with the sword." That is, not to defend the State, but to support the church. He also said, who is the author of Christian faith, that if his kingdom were of a worldly nature, his servants would use violence in support of his cause. But such was not its nature.

My creed, on this subject, is the following, viz.: that as the civil magistracy is in all nations alike, the appointment or ordinance of God, whether they are pagans, Mohammedans, or Christians, it is never to be employed in support of any religion whatsoever; nor are civil rulers on any account whatsoever to use any of that authority which they have received for and from the State, in support of Christianity, nor ever directly or indirectly to use compulsion in anything pertaining to religion; but they are to use all their authority in keeping good order in society, or in preserving the public peace, the life, liberty, reputation, and property of the citizens of the State.

Those who differ from me on this topic, I request to consider three things:

1st. That if the magistrate in the United States, for instance, pretend officially to support or defend the religion of this country; the Turkish, Japanese, Spanish, Chinese, or any other magistrate has the same power and right (being equally a divine institution there as here to accomplish the moral government of the world) to defend and support the religion of their respective countries.

2nd. That swords, cannons, guns, powder, lead, prisons, gold, silver, or bank notes, can not make the conscience bond, renew the soul, spiritually illumine the human mind, or give a new moral sense. That racks, gibbets, wheels, whips, nor even the mild punishment of four dollars' fine can not promote piety or benevolence.

3rd. That all such efforts on the part of the magistrate are prohibited in the institutes of Christianity.

I am aware that not a few model both the Church and the State after the "commonwealth of Israel," and would have something like the Jew in civil and ecclesiastical concerns. I have yet said nothing respecting the civil magistracy of the Jews, which seems to be the copy after which the "moral association" would, if they dare, model their little Sanhedrim and their young St. Giles.

With regard to the Jews, I would say there was no office purely civil. Their government was a pure theocracy, and all their offices were under the immediate appointment of their King, who was none else than their God. Hence, when they sought a king like other nations, the Lord charged them with having rejected himself as their king; civil and religious officers were reposed in the same hands; hence Moses performed offices civil and religious. The seventy elders selected to assist him in judging and awarding, took under their cognizance things civil and religious. The Jews can not become a model to any nation in the world, either in their civil government, or in their ecclesiastical; for this plain reason, that no nation ever stood in the same relation to God or received their political institutes in the same manner. I would remind those who are so eager to imitate them, that the only punishment the Jewish rulers inflicted on those who transgressed the letter of the first table of the law, was only death. The Sabbath-breaker and the blasphemer were only stoned to death. There was no commutation of the crime, for if sins against God are to be punished as such, there is no temporal privation that can be considered as such. Let those who are so zealous of punishing Sabbath-breakers and of executing what they call the law of God, be consistent with themselves and their precedents, and stone to death the Sabbath-breaker and the blasphemer.

In regard of the Sabbath day and the institutes of religion I except them entirely from the jurisdiction or cognizance of the civil magistrates in any sense whatever. But of this, more hereafter.—Candidus (Alexander Campbell), in Washington (Pa.) Reporter, Dec. 4, 1820.
