The arrest of a Seventh-day Adventist in Tennessee, and his imprisonment for working on Sunday, has excited considerable interest and discussion. While we believe that the first day of the week is the Christian Sabbath, yet we are decidedly of the opinion that this man who believes that the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord, and who has been punished for working on Sunday, is the subject of religious persecution.

It is claimed that the Christian Sabbath is a civil as well as a sacred institution, and that there is no persecution in the case mentioned because the party was neither compelled to worship or abstain from worship on Sunday. This may be true. At the same time the civil law compels him to rest two days in the week, while the moral law requires him to rest only one. The Christian who believes that the first day of the week is the day of rest, decides according to his interpretation of the Scriptures and according to his conscience, to rest on that day. Those who believe as he does, being in the majority, pass a law forbidding the Seventh-day Adventists to work on the first day of the week. The latter are as conscientious, it is to be presumed, in regard to their religious obligations and rights, as the former. To compel them to do a thing against their religious convictions, whether it be to rest or to work, by the passage of a civil law, in contravention of what they believe to be their right under the moral law, is nothing less than persecution.

Let us turn the tables. Suppose the Seventh-day Adventists should be in the majority, and should pass a law forbidding others who differ with them in this matter to work on the seventh day. Then those who believe that the first day of the week is the day of rest, would be compelled to rest two days in the week, or else pay the penalty of fine and imprisonment for working on the seventh day. This, as in the other case, would be simply religious persecution.

The solution of the whole trouble lies in the repeal of the law. There is a similar law on the statute books of Georgia, and a few cases like the one in Tennessee, have occurred in this State. Let the State keep its hands off matters of conscience and religion where people take the Bible for the guide of their conduct.—Christian Index, Atlanta, Ga., Sept. 13.
