The Baptists have, as a people, been noted for their adherence to the principles of religious liberty. In the past they have themselves felt the hand of oppression as the result of religious laws. We were therefore surprised and sorry to see the following statements in the Victorian Baptist for August, 1894, which are a virtual repudiation of the doctrine of religious freedom, and contain an unworthy evasion:—

On the face of it, it seems a shameful thing that in a Christian and Protestant nation men should be imprisoned, or otherwise punished, for adhering to their religious convictions. So it would be if the punishment were inflicted on religious grounds, or in support of laws made to enforce religious observances of any kind.

But why not permit those who deem it a sacred duty to rest on Saturday, to work on Sunday? Because to do so would be to make it impossible to secure for the laborer his weekly rest. . . . It is, unquestionably, hard for the few who rest on Saturday as a matter of religious obligation, to be compelled to rest also on Sunday by the laws of the land. But it is clear that the law which compels them to do so is, or should be, based upon purely civil and sociological, and not at all on religious grounds.

This is sophistical reasoning. It teaches that religious persecution is proper under certain circumstances, if it is only carried on under some other name. But it is as unworthy as would be an argument in favor of a general, compulsory State law for baptism, upon the physiological ground that bathing is needful and healthful.

Every Sunday law that has ever been made has been religious, no matter what it has been called, or upon what "grounds" enacted, because Sunday observance itself is religious. It has its root in religion. To call a thing something other than it is does not make it so. But that the Sunday law of Charles II. is religious, its wording plainly shows. It is an act "for the better observation of, and keeping holy, the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday," and provides that,—

All the laws enacted and in force concerning the observation of the Lord's day and repairing to the church therein be carefully put in execution.

And that all and every person and persons whatsoever shall, on every Lord's day, apply themselves thereon in the duties of piety and true religion publiquely and privately.

This is neither "civil" nor "sociological."—W. A. C., in Australian Sentinel.
