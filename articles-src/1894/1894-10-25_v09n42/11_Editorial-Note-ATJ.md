We observe that Rev. E. Thompson, D.D., of Los Angeles, Cal., classes Elder A. T. Jones, the Adventist, with S. P. Putnam among the "leaders of antichristian thought." Why is Mr. Jones thus shut out of the fold he loves so well? Because he has the temerity to assert, and prove, that religion and the State should be kept separate. This is his offense, and this makes him a "leader of antichristian thought" in the estimation of the National Reformers. They cannot conceive of Christianity as something apart from the political machine. And yet they talk about "religious liberty."—Truth Seeker.
