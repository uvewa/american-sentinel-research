*(Concluded.)*

As I am writing these lines, our daily papers are publishing an encyclical letter of the pope—his swan's song, as some say—which exhibits that wonderful craftiness of which I have just spoken. It is an appeal for reunion, specially directed to the Greek and Anglican churches. "Speaking to those nations which have for the last three centuries been separated from the church, the pope shows that there is no certain rule of faith and authority left to them. A large number among them have overthrown the very foundations of Christianity by denying the divinity of Christ and the inspiration of the Scriptures."

Is it not the wonder of wonders that the man who incarnates that awful system by which the Bible has been burned, and its disciples, even to this day, persecuted to death; that system which has established tradition above the Bible, has contradicted every Bible doctrine and tried to silence every Bible preacher, should now dare to stand before the world as the advocate of the Bible against—the Protestants! And yet, it is, alas! but too true that Protestantism to a large extent is no more the religion of the Bible. This accounts for the boldness of Rome, and for her success.

We, the French Evangelical Christians, can never be deceived by this pretended "angel of light." We know that Rome is the responsible instigator of those very evils against which our deluded people are trying to find a remedy in her. We know that immorality, infidelity, lawlessness, are the offspring of Roman Catholicism. Idolatry and atheism are not so far apart as it seems, and the same people may pass with astonishing swiftness from the one to the other.

I shall give, on this point, the testimony of a priest.

A little time ago I visited the great shrine of the Virgin at Lourdes, a little town in the Pyrenees, where the "Mother of God" is said to have appeared to a young shepherdess. A beautiful cathedral, which has cost one million dollars and more, has been erected near the spot; the grotto from which the miraculous water springs has been decked with marble, and every sign of lavish and idolatrous devotion may be seen there. On the day I was present, over twelve thousand pilgrims had come, by a hundred trains, from all parts of France, some having travelled five or six hundred miles. At the railway station young men belonging to the patrician families—young dukes, counts, and barons of the purest blood—were in attendance with sedan-chairs and portative beds, to take the sick and lame from the trains and carry them to the shrine, thus gaining for themselves indulgences. I shall never forget the sight of this motley crowd surrounding the beds of the sick, and many among themselves bearing marks of leprosy or some other foul disease—men, women, children, twelve thousand of them, hugely pressed in front of the cave, lifting up their arms to the gilded statue, crying, shouting, singing, led by the priests! I shall never forget these women kissing the ground, raising up with dust on their lips, then kneeling down to kiss the ground again; others stooping on the fountain to drink a little water. I saw a poor paralytic carried by four stout priests into a little recess in the rock, and there plunged bodily in the cold water, while he was shouting to the virgin with an earnestness, an eagerness, which reminded one of Baal's prophets.

My eyes were moist with tears as I beheld this host of my countrymen thus deluded; meanwhile I vainly waited for a word on the part of those bishops and priests—a single word—about Christ and the forgiveness of sins through him. As I was thus looking on with evident emotion a young priest whom I had met in a hotel before came up to me.

"You seem to be moved," said he, "by this wonderful sight."

"Yes, I am," I answered. "But what moves me is to think that there is so much faith wasted here. To think that twelve thousand people may have found time and money to come so far to seek temporal blessings which they will not receive, while they might in their own homes have received from God himself, through Jesus Christ, eternal life!" "Do you, sir," said I earnestly to my friend—"do you really believe in this?"

The young priest looked at me gravely, and was silent for a while. Then he said:

"No, I do not believe that the virgin appeared here, nor that the faith of these poor people will be rewarded. I deplore this superstition as you do; and there are others among us who deplore it also. I believe," he said, growing bold, "that this place is the greatest school of infidelity we have in France. People come here on the promptings of their ignorant parish priest, full of expectations. They have, in some cases, borrowed money for the journey. They have laid all their stakes on this card. They pray, they sing, they drink the water, they dip themselves into it, . . . but they are not healed. Then they lose faith, not only in Lourdes, but in religion altogether, and they return home, saying, 'There is no God.' So, while these people pray that they may be healed, I pray that they may not become atheists."

Thus spoke my friend, the young priest. Then I said to him:

"Why, then, do you remain in a church which holds such things?"

"Well," he said, rather embarrassed, "we are not bound to believe or to teach that the virgin has appeared here. The bishop of this diocese has made an inquiry which he has found satisfactory, and so the pilgrimage has been permitted; but as long as the holy see has not pronounced, we may or may not agree with the bishop in this case. It is not a matter of faith."

"And how can I respect a church which is thus double-sided?—a church which gives the enlightened freedom to reject the superstitions which she lays upon the poor people, and manages thus to keep in her fold, in apparent unity, men like Montalembert, Father Gratry, and others—spiritual, true Christian men, who would have scorned to believe in such childish things—and Bernadette Soubirous, the shepherdess to whom the virgin appeared?"

"Well, the poor people cannot understand the sublime doctrine of the gospel without some materialization of it!"

"Is that so? Did ever Jesus Christ stoop to forge false miracles to satisfy the common people?"

My friend did not answer, but before I left him I tried to show him the beauty of the gospel simplicity and artlessness. We parted, both deeply moved; and I dare to hope that a good work was begun in his soul.

In these times of infidelity, the temptation for evangelical Christians who do not sufficiently know Rome is to accept a kind of compromise with her; to look upon her as one of the forms of true religion; one of the things which, on the whole, make for purity and godliness. This temptation is a most dangerous one. We are fully aware that there are Roman Catholic dignitaries who evince a great love for souls and for God; we do not judge them; we hope they are sincere; we leave them to God and their own consciences. But, as a system, popery is the masterpiece of hell. It is a wonderful adaptation of paganism to Christianity; sensual in her worship, loose in her ethics, crafty and grasping in her politics—such is the Church of Rome. Her tendency everywhere has been to degrade and pollute mankind. Like the magician Circe, who changed Ulysses' companions into swine, Rome changes the noble aspirations of the human souls into selfish, base, and corrupted desires. She wrecks the virtue of young men and young women who come to her for protection; desecrates the home, enslaves the mind, darkens the soul. Do not judge Rome on that which she allows you to see of her in Protestant, enlightened countries; go to Portugal, go to Spain, to Italy, to Corsica, wherever she is uncontrolled by a dissenting religion. Yes, Rome is "the harlot which causes the nations to sin, the mother of the abominations of the earth."

But how shall we oppose her growing power?

I am fully convinced by my experience as a missionary for twenty years among my own people, that it will not be by clumsy imitations of her gorgeous display, but rather by a return to the primitive simplicity of worship manifested in the upper room. To worship God in spirit and in truth, and not in beautiful temples, the cost of which would support two or three missionaries for a whole lifetime; to invite, and not to exclude, the poor, the sinner, the outcasts, who now find it so difficult, even if they would, to sit in our refined places of worship—such seems to me the imperative duty put upon us if we do not wish to see the masses go to Rome, which to them appears so much more democratic than ourselves.

I have also a deep conviction that it is only through the Bible—as the Reformers did—that we shall withstand popery. Anything, however pious in tone, that helps to destroy the people's faith in the Bible as an infallible book, works on behalf of Rome. I have no time to dilate on this point, but I beg the readers to reflect on it. It is to me the vital question, and I do not see any other alternative but this: the Bible or the pope.

Finally, let us preach Christ, his free forgiveness, his atoning blood. Ethical, political, or social preaching—"sermons for the times," as they are sometimes termed—will not prevent the drift of the masses toward the old system. But the upholding of the Crucified—I have seen it, thank God, hundreds of times—will always prove the power of God unto salvation. Rome has many weapons—money, genius, traditions, beauty of forms. It appeals to the lower nature of man, dispenses with the necessity of a second birth, renders sin easy. It deifies mankind, as all heathen religions do. It must, therefore, have a great measure of success, as it corresponds so marvellously to man's natural cowardice and depravation. But if we are faithful to the Bible and to the Crucified, we need not fear defeat; all true Nathanaels, all the sincere and noble hearts who are seeking a real Saviour, will come out of Rome to meet us. The true sheep know the Shepherd's voice, and, hearing it, follow it.

While, in his encyclical letters, the pope extols the Bible, he has forbidden the circulation of a translation of the gospels made by a stanch Roman Catholic, Henri Lasserre, and approved by a number of bishops. At first the circulation was permitted, and more than 160,000 copies were sold (the gospels alone) at the high price of four francs per copy (eighty cents). The church took alarm at this current thirst for the Word on the part of the people, and a papal order was issued forbidding the people to take the word from their own. Henri Lasserre is a man enlightened, and he has not been trying to reverse the papal will, but without success.

As a matter of fact, there is not, in papal countries, a Bible or a New Testament to be bought in booksellers' stores, or from colporteurs, except the Protestant versions. And yet in England and in America, where it would be impossible to take the Bible away from the people, Rome tries to pass herself off as the defender of the Bible!
