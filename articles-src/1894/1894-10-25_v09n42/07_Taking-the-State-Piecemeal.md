FAILING to secure a State Sunday law the Sunday forces of California have been compassing their ends in another way, namely, by securing from city and county boards ordinances prohibiting Sunday labor and business within their respective jurisdictions. In this way a considerable portion of the State has been brought under Sunday regulations more or less strict. And now the same tactics are being adopted in Michigan. The city of St. Louis, in that State, has recently adopted an ordinance which provides that—

SEC. 1. No person shall keep open his or her store, shop, restaurant, grocery, or other place of business, pleasure, or amusement, or sell or offer for sale any goods, wares, or merchandise, within the corporate limits of the city of St. Louis on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday.

SEC. 2. No person shall do any manner of work, or take part in any sport, game or play, or be present at any dancing, public diversion, show or entertainment within the corporate limits of the city of St. Louis on said first day of the week.

SEC. 3. The foregoing provisions shall not be construed to prevent works of necessity or charity, or the sale of drugs and medicines, or undertakers' goods, and shall not prohibit the opening of drug stores and undertakers' stores for such purpose.

SEC. 5. Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this ordinance, shall upon conviction thereof, before any justice of the peace of the city of St. Louis, be punished by a fine of not less than five dollars, nor more than ten dollars and costs of prosecution.

The State of Michigan already has a Sunday law, but it is probably not rigid enough, as it exempts observers of the seventh day.
