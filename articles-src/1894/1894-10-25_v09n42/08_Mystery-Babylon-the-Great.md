We clip the following from the Boston Citizen:—

Priest Phelan, editor of the Western Watchman, arguing in his paper last week that Peter lived in Rome, made this statement:—

"In Peter's first epistle he sends 'greeting from the church in Babylon.' All commentators understand Babylon to mean Rome. For reasons of this conclusion, see Doellinger 'First Age of the Church,' page 97."

Upon which the Baptist Flag thus comments:—

"This concession upon the part not only of the Watchman but of the leading Roman Catholic writers as well, that Rome in the Bible is Babylon, is quite significant. It follows, with absolute certainty, that 'Mystery, Babylon the Great, mother of harlots, and the abomination of the earth,' is the Roman Catholic Church. Out of her own mouth the Roman Church stands condemned as the bloody Babylon of Revelation."—The Primitive Catholic, September 8.
