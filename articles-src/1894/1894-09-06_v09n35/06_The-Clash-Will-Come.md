## The Clash Will Come.

Just now the loose talk about the disarmament which comes to the surface every now and then seems to have appeared in Europe and found its way into the public press by whom it is being discussed. There is no question that the great armies are a great burden. But they are not kept up for the fun of the thing, but are maintained with a very distinct purpose in view—the maintenance of the national integrity, pending a war, and the advance of the national boundaries when war comes. Germany may be satisfied with the existing status, but if so she is the one satisfied power. France certainly wants Alsace and Lorraine back again; she wants also revenge for the last war, with the boundary line of the Rhine. Italy wants the Irredente provinces held by Austria; and Austria wants Servia and Herzegovina, while Russia wants Stamboul: she is determined to have a seaport for her navy and her commerce.

A few facts show how very serious is this work of maintaining an armament, and how little disposed, especially France and Russia are, to give up their work of providing for the national defense. In France the new enlistments are over 216,000 per annum; in Germany about 200,000. In France the percentage of men under arms to the whole population equals 1.465; in Germany it is 1.114. In Russia it is 1.037. France and Russia together can put into the field 1,000,000 men and 1,700 guns more than Germany and her allies. Now, the demand for reduction in the existing scheme of military service does not come from France, which bears the heaviest burden, nor from any section of the French people. On the contrary, the testimony is conclusive that the nation approves the state of things as it exists.

That France does not feel it such a burden to continue her armament as Germany does is shown by the condition of the French agriculturalists who have been able through import duties to secure for their staple a price no less than forty per cent. above that which most of the rest of the world had to accept. This single circumstance would seem sufficient to account for the difference of attitude between the French and the other continental nations toward the system of universal military service, which those others complain of as a burden, and which France seems to carry off as a species of patriotic picnic. The fact is disarmament has become a commercial and industrial question, in which the interests of England and France seem well enough subserved by the state of things as they are. There will be disarmaments certainly. But before that day Europe will ring with the clash of arms and witness such fighting as she has not seen since the time of Napoleon the Great.—Christian Work
