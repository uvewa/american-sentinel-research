## Consonant and Dissonant.

The editor of the Enterprise of Dresden, Tenn., the city where Mr. Capps, a Seventh-day Adventist is serving a sentence of nine months in jail for doing common labor on Sunday, published Aug. 3, his opinion of the case which we print below. Our apology for publishing the matter is to call attention to the character of Mr. Capp's persecutors and to furnish an opportunity for introducing other and better opinions, which we do in the right-hand column.

Weakley Country has at last got 'em. The Seventh-day Adventists are upon us. A "mar-tyr" is in jail for Christ's sake, and the faithful are beginning to flock here and distribute their literature and look humble and persecuted.

'As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison. Therefore they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word.' Acts 8:3, 4

Yes, Weakley County escaped for a long time; but these persistent cranks at last succeeded in raising the wind, and we are destined to have a taste of what has plagued several neighboring counties for years.

'And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also; whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar.' Acts 17:6, 7.

The great distinguishing doctrine of the Seventh-day Adventists is, that all Christendom and all civilization are entirely "off" in their selection of Sunday as the Sabbath and the day of rest.

'Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.' Rev. 14:12. 'And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.' Rev. 12:17.

This sect has discovered a sort of Baconian cipher in the Bible that says Saturday is the day. With this wonderful scoop of news in their possession, the Adventists have set about to correct an erring world.

'Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.' Ex. 20:8, 9.

The consensus of universal opinion might have settled upon Wednesday as the day of rest, and it would have been satisfactory to everybody but a crank.

'Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil.' Ex. 23:2. 'Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.' Acts 5:29.

The Adventists have gained a great victory at last in Weakley County. They are untiring proselyters and as unremitting in their efforts to "convert"

'Preach the word: be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine: for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine.' 2 Tim. 4:2, 3.

somebody as a Mormon missionary.

They at last got a convert. That is all they wanted. They converted a poor, weak, imbecile, near Trezevant,

"Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom?" James 2:5. "Not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, . . . are called. . . . God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things that are mighty." 1 Cor. 1:26, 27.

and the deluded creature at once set his plow to going on Sunday,

"Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work." Ex. 20:8.

to the great scandal of the neighborhood and defiant violation of the civil law.

"I have always understood that these people are peaceable and law abiding citizens, and I have yet to learn that the acts for which they are indicted have injured or discommoded their fellow-citizens in any way, or interfered in the slightest with any substantial rights of others."—Ex-Governor Porter, in Memphis Commercial, Feb. 3, 1893. On this point see also Ex-Senator Tolley's article on this page.

Of course, the poor fool had to be arrested, arraigned in court, fined a small sum,

The fine and costs in the Circuit Court amounted to $51.80.

and, to reach the goal of martyrdom, of course the convict refused to pay the fine or secure it, and the judge could do nothing else but send him to jail. Eureka! The Adventists had gained what they started in for; they now have at last a "martyr" in Weakley County. They now could scatter their measles literature over the country, announcing in tragic terms that in their land of boasted freedom, under a Constitution guaranteeing religious liberty, there was a man lying in a Weakley County jail because he insisted on worshiping God according to the dictates of his conscience.

"The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord," and the sign of his power. Sunday is the Sabbath of the Roman Catholic Church, and the sign of its power. —Abridgment of Christian (Roman Catholic) Doctrine, p. 52. "The imprisonment of Seventh-day Adventists in several States . . . for performing bodily labor on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday, proves that the Government assumes the right to enforce a religious dogma of the Catholic Church."—George Pax, Catholic priest, of Sleepy Eye, Minn. Seventh-day Adventists refuse to observe this "dogma of the Catholic Church," and further refuse to pay a fine on their loyalty to God.

That's the way the Adventists always present the matter, ever suppressing the fact that their "martyrs" are not in jail for their religious opinions, but simply because they are defiant violators of the civil law.

"The rulers of Massachusetts put the Quakers to death and banished 'Antinomians' and 'Anabaptists,' not because of their religious tenets, but because of their violation of civil laws. This is the justification they pleaded, and it was the best they could make. Miserable excuse! But just so it is; wherever there is such a union of Church and State, heresy and heretical practices are apt to become violations of the civil code, and are punished no longer as errors in religion, but infractions of the laws of the land. So the defenders of the Inquisition have always spoken and written in justification of that awful and most iniquitous tribunal."—Religion in America, p. 94.

Numerically considered, these Adventist cranks are about the weakest sect in the Union, but they have a daring persistency and bold aggressiveness about them that have enabled them to kick up more devilment to the square inch than all the other religious fanatics combined.

"Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom." Luke 12:32. "Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it." Matt. 7:13, 14.

All during election day one of these sleek-looking apostles, who

"Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth." Matt. 5:5. "But sanctify

appeared like he would very much enjoy being kicked for the Lord's sake so that he could get a place in the book of martyrs, stood at the polls and handed out to each man a pamphlet purporting to explain why his church would not observe our Sunday.

The literature is of the same kind that is so industriously sent out from the sect's headquarters at Battle Creek, Mich., every line of which is a vicious attack on our Christian Sabbath.

"We have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man." 2 Cor. 7:2. And to all concerned we say with terrible earnestness, Count well the cost before taking upon yourselves the awful responsibility of attempting to force upon us, by pains and penalties, the sign of allegiance to Rome. Beware, 'lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.' (Quoted from "literature" alluded to.)

Judge Swiggart and Jon Bond, who was then our attorney-general, had a bothersome experience with these fanatics in Henry and Obion counties for a number of years.

"I believe that the action of our courts with reference to this question of compulsory Sunday idleness has hitherto been in contravention of the principles of American liberty as well as contrary to the expressed provision of the Constitution of our State."—Ex-Governor Porter, in Memphis Commercial, Feb. 3, 1893.

The organization at Battle Creek, known as the Religious Liberty Association, keep an eagle eye on all cases where their members are jailed for violations of our Sunday law, and they flock to the scene of manufactured martyrdom,

"The Lord God in your hearts; and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear." 1 Pet. 3:15.

Preach the word: be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.

"I believe that the action of our courts with reference to this question of compulsory Sunday idleness has hitherto been in contravention of the principles of American liberty as well as contrary to the expressed provision of the Constitution of our State."—Ex-Governor Porter, in Memphis Commercial, Feb. 3, 1893.

"The object of this Association shall be to protect the rights of conscience; to maintain a total separation between religion and the civil government; and by means of the platform and the press to educate the public mind on the relations that should exist between the Church and the State."—Art. 2 International Religious Liberty Association Constitution.

Judge Swiggart has announced from the bench that no specious plea of religious liberty can influence him from strictly applying the plain statute of our civil law in these cases of willful and defiant violation of the Sabbath, and that every man so charged and convicted before him will be fined and sent to jail if he fails to pay the fine.

"Will the Seventh-day Adventists 'make history,' as their prototypes did of old? Will their persistent and unhesitating choice between 'Diana and Christ' profitably compel the attention of those who lead public opinion and mold it into laws to the anomaly of the existence in free America of any statute which is simply the embodiment of a religious dogma, and which can be used by one sect to persecute another, so that there shall at last arise in every State, some prophet bold enough to propose, and strong enough to carry, the repeal of the Sunday law? And, meantime, will the patient endurance, the 'sweet reasonableness,' the martyr spirit of those who when they are reviled revile not again, so prevail against the animosity of their neighbors, that very shame shall extinguish the ardor of 'Christian' mobs and public officials; and the Sunday laws, though not yet repealed, shall be permitted to lapse into innocuous desuetude? Well, let us hope for each and all of these things."—James T. Ringgold, of the Baltimore Bar, in "The Legal Sunday."

So to our Adventist cranks we make the blessed announcement that within Swiggart's jurisdiction they have the encouraging prospect of being able to manufacture a large quantity of first-class martyrdom.

"Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer; behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; . . . be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life." Rev. 2:10.
