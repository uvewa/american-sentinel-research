## Papal Infallibility.

(Continued.)

This matter first appeared in an anonymous pamphlet published and circulated in Italy immediately following the Vatican council of 1870, which proclaimed the dogma of papal infallibility. The pamphlet purported to be a speech delivered in the council "by a bishop," against the dogma. However it is not published on the strength of its having been delivered "by a bishop," &c. this is denied, but it is reprinted solely on its own merits, scriptural, and historical.

But I hear it said on all sides, was not St. Peter at Rome? Was he not crucified with his head down? Are the seats on which he taught, and the altars at which he said the mass, not in this eternal city? St. Peter having been at Rome, my venerable brethren, rests only on tradition; but if he had been bishop of Rome, how can you from that episcopate prove his supremacy? Scaligero, one of the most learned of men, has not hesitated to say that St. Peter's episcopate and residence at Rome ought to be classed with ridiculous legends. (Repeated cries, "Shut his mouth; shut his mouth; make him come down from the pulpit.") Venerable brethren, I am ready to be silent, but is it not better, in an assembly like ours, to prove all things, as the apostle commands, and to believe what is good? But, my venerable friends, we have a dictator before whom we must all, even His Holiness, Pius IX., prostrate ourselves, and bow our heads, and be silent. That dictator is history. This is not like a legend which can be made as the potter makes his clay, but is like a diamond, which cuts on the glass words which cannot be cancelled. Till now I have only leaned on her; and if I have found no trace of the papacy in the apostolic days, the fault is hers, not mine. Do you wish to put me into the position of one accused of falsehood? You may do it, if you can. I hear from the right these words,—"Thou art Peter, and on this rock I build my church" (Matt. 16). I will answer this objection presently, my venerable brethren; but before doing so, I wish to present you with the result of my historical researches.

Finding no trace of the papacy in the days of the apostles, I said to myself, I shall find what I am in search of in the annals of the church. Well, I say it frankly—I have sought for a pope in the first four centuries, and I have not found him. None of you, I hope, will doubt the great authority of the holy bishop of Hippo, the great and blessed St. Augustine. This pious doctor, the honor and glory of the Catholic Church, was secretary in the council of Melvie. In the decrees of this venerable assembly are to be found these significant words,—"Whoever wills to appeal to those beyond the sea shall not be received by any one in Africa to the communion." The bishops of Africa acknowledged the bishop of Rome so little that they smote with ex-communication those who would have recourse to an appeal. These same bishops, in the sixth council of Carthage, held under Aurelius, bishop of that city, wrote to Celestinus, bishop of Rome, to warn him not to receive appeals from the bishops, priest, or clerics of Africa; and that he should send no more legates or commissaries; and that he should not introduce human pride into the church. That the patriarch of Rome had from the earliest times tried to draw to himself all the authority, is an evident fact; but it is an equally evident fact that he had not the supremacy which the Ultramontanes attribute to him. Had he possessed it, would the bishops of Africa—St. Augustine first among them—have dared to prohibit the appeals of their decrees to his supreme tribunal? I confess, without difficulty, that the patriarch of Rome held the first place. One of Justinian's laws says, "Let us order, after the definitions of the four councils, that the holy pope of ancient Rome shall be the first of the bishops, and that the Most High Archbishop of Constantinople, which is the new Rome, shall be the second." "Bow down then to the supremacy of the pope," you will say to me. Do not run so fast to this conclusion, my venerable brethren, inasmuch as the law of Justinian has written in the face of it, "Of the order of the patriarchal sees," precedence is one thing—the power of jurisdiction is another. For example, supposing that in Florence there was an assembly of all the bishops of the kingdom, the precedence would be given to the primate of Florence, as among the easterns it would be accorded to the patriarch of Constantinople, and in England to the Archbishop of Canterbury. But neither the first, nor the second, nor the third could deduce from the position assigned to him a jurisdiction over his colleagues.

The importance of the bishops of Rome proceeded not from a divine power, but from the importance of the city in which they had their seat. Monsignor Darboy is not superior in dignity to the Archbishop Avignon; but in spite of that, Paris gives him a consideration which he would not have if, instead of his having his palace on the bank of the Seine, he had it on that of the Rhone. That which is true in the religious order is the same in civil and political matters; the prefect of Cairo it is not more a prefect than he of Pisa; but civilly and politically he has a greater importance. I have said that from the very first centuries, the patriarch of Rome aspired to the universal government of the Church. Unfortunately he very nearly reached it; but he had not succeeded assuredly in his pretensions, for the Emperor Theodosius II. made a law by which he established that the patriarch of Constantinople should have the same authority as he of Rome (Leg. cod. de sacr., etc.). The fathers of the council of Chalcedon put the bishops of the new and the old Rome in the same order on all things, even ecclesiastical (Can. 28). The sixth council of Carthage forbade all the bishops to take the title of Prince of the Bishops, or Sovereign Bishops. As for this title of universal bishop, which the popes took later, St. Gregory I., believing that his successors would never think of adorning themselves with it, wrote these remarkable words: "None of my predecessors have consented to take this profane name; for when a patriarch gives himself the name of Universal, the title of patriarch suffers discredit. Far be it then, from Christians to desire to give themselves a title which brings discredit on their brethren." The words of St. Gregory are directed to his colleague of Constantinople, who pretended to the primacy of the church.

Pope Pelagio II. calls John, bishop of Constantinople, who aspired to the high priesthood, "impious and profane." "Do not care," he said, "for the title of universal, which John has usurped illegally; let none of the patriarchs take this profane name; for what misfortunes may we not expect, if among the priests such elements arise? They would get what has been foretold for them, 'He is the king of the sons of pride'" (Pelagio II., lett. 13).

These are authorities, and I might add a hundred more of equal value. Do they not prove, with a clearness equal to the splendor of the sun at midday, that the first bishops of Rome were not till much later recognized as universal bishops and heads of the church? And, on the other hand, who does not know that from the year 325, in which the first council of Nice was held, down to 580, the year of the second Ecumenical Council of Constantinople, among more that 1,109 bishops who assisted at the six first general councils, there were no more than nineteen western bishops? Who does not know that the councils were convoked by the emperors without informing, and sometimes against the wish of the bishop of Rome?—that Hosius, bishop of Cordova, presided at the first council of Nice, and edited the canons of it? The same Hosius presided afterwards at the council Sardica, excluding the legates of Julius, bishop of Rome. I say no more, my venerable brethren, and I come now to speak of the great argument which you mentioned before—to establish the primacy of the bishop of Rome.

By the rock (petra) on which the holy church is built, you understand Peter (pietra). If this were true the dispute would be at an end; but our forefathers—and they certainly knew something—did not think of it as we do. St. Cyril, in his fourth book on the trinity, says, "I believe that by the rock you must understand the unshaken faith of the apostles." St. Hilary, bishop of Poictiers, in his second book on the trinity, says, "The rock (pietra) is the blessed and only rock of the faith confessed by the mouth of St. Peter;" and in the sixth book of the trinity, he says, "It is on this rock of the confession of faith that the church is built." "God," says St. Jerome, in the sixth book of St. Matthew, "has founded his church on this rock, and it is from this rock that the Apostle Peter has been named." After him, St. Chrysostom says in his fifty-third homily on St. Matthew, "On this rock I will build my church—that is on the faith of the confession." Now what was the confession of the apostle? Here it is, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." Ambrose, the holy archbishop of Milan (on the 2nd chap. of the Ephesians), St. Basil of Seleucia, and the fathers of the council of Chalcedon, teach exactly the same thing.

Of all the doctors of Christian antiquity, St. Augustine occupies one of the first places for knowledge and holiness. Listen, then, to what he writes in his second treatise on the first epistle of St. John, "What do the words mean, 'I will build my church on this rock?' On this faith on that which said, 'Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.'" In his 12th treatise on St. John we find this most significant phrase, "On this rock which thou hast confessed I will build my church, since Christ was the rock." The great bishop believed so little that the church was built on St. Peter, that he said to his people in his thirteenth sermon, "Thou art Peter, and on this rock (pietra) which thou hast confessed, on this rock which thou hast known, saying, 'Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God,' I will build my church above myself, who am the Son of the living God: I will build it on me, and not me on thee." That which St. Augustine thought upon this celebrated passage was the opinion of all Christendom in his time. Therefore to resume, I establish, 1. That Jesus had given to his apostles the same power that he gave to St. Peter. 2. That the apostles never recognized in St. Peter the vicar of Jesus Christ, and the infallible doctor of the church. 3. That St. Peter never thought of being pope, and never acted as if he were pope. 4. That the councils of the first four centuries, while they recognized the high position which the bishop of Rome occupied in the church, on account of Rome, only accords to him a preliminacy of honor—never of power or jurisdiction. 5. That the holy fathers, in the famous passage, "Thou art Peter, and on this rock I build my church," never understood that the church was built on St. Peter (super petrum), but on the rock (super petram), that is, on the confession of the faith of the apostle.

I conclude victoriously with history, with reason, with logic, with good sense, and with a Christian conscience, that Jesus Christ did not confer any supremacy on St. Peter, and that the bishops of Rome did not become sovereigns of the church, but only by confiscating one by one all the rights of the episcopate. (Voices, "Silence, impudent Protestant! Silence!") No, I am not an impudent Protestant. History is neither Catholic, nor Anglican, nor Calvinistic, nor Lutheran, nor Arminian, nor schismatic Greek, nor Ultramontane. She is what she is—that is, something stronger than all confessions of faith of the canons of the Ecumenical Councils. Write against it if you dare! but you cannot destroy it, no more than taking a brick out of the coliseum would make it fall. If I have said anything which history proves to be false, show it to me by history, and without a moment's hesitation I will make an honorable apology; but be patient and you will see that I have not said all that I would or could; and even were the funeral pile waiting for me in the place of St. Peter's, I should not be silent, and I am obliged to go on.
