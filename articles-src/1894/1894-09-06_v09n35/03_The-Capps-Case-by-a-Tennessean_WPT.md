# The Capps Case by a Tennessean.

THIS is but one of a series of cases tried in the courts of Tennessee, all involving directly and unmistakably the freedom of religion, the liberty of conscience. The bare statement of the case ought to be sufficient to startle every true Tennessean to a realization of the dangers that threaten our institutions. The idea of a peaceable, orderly citizen, being arraigned in our courts for no other offense than that of insisting on the right to worship as seemeth good to him in the sight of God, would have been a sufficient tocsin of alarm to have brought every Tennessean to his feet in manly protest against such an outrage as long as the spirit prevailed that inspired Jackson and his compatriots and their immediate successors to the deeds of valor in the cause of liberty, religious as well as political, that made this State, among all the States, the volunteer State. The inspiration that must have guided our sires in all these deeds of glory is surely fled the land. Their sons seem to have inherited none of it, else these shameful persecutions, under the forms of law, though it may be, could not transpire, and Tennesseans still have the hardihood to boast that our laws and institutions are founded on a love of liberty and fairness to all alike.

Instead of these things alarming our people to a realizing sense of their danger, they seem to look on with almost stoic indifference. Indeed, as long as such editorials, as appeared in a paper published in the immediate locality where this shameful persecution occurred, go unrebuked by the balance of the press of the State, it seems the spirit of liberty in the State is dead. No Puritan ever gloated with more fiendish or inhuman delight over a hapless victim consigned to jail or the stake in the days of bitterest and most shameful persecutions for conscience' sake in New England, than does this editor over the imprisonment of poor Capps.

According to this editor the gravamen of Capps' offense seems to be "the great scandal of the neighborhood," resulting from his "setting his plow to going on Sunday." Some narrow-souled, white-livered Puritan was always greatly scandalized if his neighbor was not altogether as pious as himself, or even if his piety took a different direction to his and led him to maintain any religious view different to his, the Puritan's. The organized, systematic crusade of the whole world by the Jesuits to extirpate heresy was founded on and inspired by the same fiendish sentiment, the enforcement of which by civil law has drenched the fairest portions of earth in rivers of blood.

The imprisonment, the whipping at the post, and hanging on the gibbet, of Baptists and Quakers, by New England Puritans, had all, and just the same, justification that can be claimed for these Sunday persecutions and imprisonments. In the former, as well as these latter cases, the plea was to prevent the scandalizing the neighborhood, to maintain the peace and dignity of the State. It is a great scandal to the neighborhood, a great disturbance of the peace, and awfully against the dignity of the State, for a poor fellow to plow in his field, however remote it may be from any public road, or the public view in any way, on Sunday; though his necessities may forbid his losing more than one day out of seven from the work necessary to support himself and family; and what is more to him, his conscience forbids it also. For his law of conscience in the case commands that, "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work," Sunday being one of the six. This law, as he conceives, came directly from Jehovah at Mount Sinai, and was given to all mankind in all the ages. The same law commanded that he should "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy." And it specifies, "But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." They, Sunday advocates, have quit denying that that is our Saturday.

To work on Sunday under these circumstances is a great offense to the neighborhood, so much so that in a similar case in Maryland a son actually had to play the part of a spy on his father, to detect the great scandal there is in Sunday work, so private and orderly was he proceeding about his business on that day. The questions of conscience involved matter nothing to these sleuth hounds in pursuing their hapless victims. In the Maryland case it mattered not to the son that his father regarded Sunday-keeping a Catholic institution and not a Bible command; for all the command there is on the subject makes Saturday the day to be kept. It matters not that all who do not believe in this Sunday mockery of a Sabbath do believe that to keep it is but receiving the "mark of the beast," which all professing Christians are solemnly warned against in the Scriptures, and which all anti-Catholics believe to be the observance of the Catholic laws and institutions, of which Sunday-keeping is unmistakably one of the most prominent. Now from all this it is plain to be seen, so plain not even the fool need to err therein, that this Sunday question is purely and exclusively a religious question, a question of conscience. The question of disestablishing the State Church in Virginia and North Carolina and other States where the Episcopal Church was the established church, was no more religious and involved no more the rights of conscience and the freedom of religion, than does this Sunday question. The plea was then urged that the cause of religion required the support of the civil power, and that to remove it would demoralize society. It is the plea now urged to sustain the Sunday institution. It is a civil institution, necessary to the civil welfare of the community, they urge. That this is a lie, black and infamous, cowardly and mean, the subterfuge, the figment of religious frenzy, and the spirit of religious intolerance, is seen in the fact that every civil statute to sustain Sunday predicates it on a recognition of the religious view of the case. Every one recognizes it as the "Sabbath" or the "Lord's day." And so in all the court decisions on the subject. And as Crafts, the evil genius of all this Sunday deviltry, this legislation on the subject, remarked, "Take the religion out and you take the rest out." It could not be a rest-day if it were not a holy day, in his conception.

And so it is, this Sunday agitation involves necessarily the settlement of a purely religious controversy by the State, as to which is the day to be kept, Saturday or Sunday, or whether either or any is to be kept. The writer believes none is. The Christian's rest-day is every day, a perfect rest from all his own labors in the effort to save himself, and a perfect repose in the full faith that his Lord and Saviour, who came "to save his people from their sins," will carry on "the good work he hath begun in the heart until the day of Jesus Christ."

That the State has no jurisdiction in such controversies, and that all Sunday or other religious legislation is forbidden is settled clearly and conclusively by the language of our State Constitution, Article 1, Section 3—the Bill of Rights: "That all men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own conscience; that no man can, of right, be compelled to attend, erect, or support any place of worship, or to maintain any minister, against his consent; that no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience; and that no preference shall ever be given, by law, to any religious establishment or mode of worship." Only religious fanaticism of the worst type, that which always engenders persecution, could so becloud the public judgment and conscience as that there could be a moment's hesitancy in coming to a fixed conclusion that this article condemns all such legislation as these laws.

The latest indications are of a returning sense of justice and right in this matter. All hail the glorious omen! The Democratic Convention that met at Nashville last week to nominate a candidate for governor, adopted the following plank in its platform, bearing directly on the subject of religious liberty: "To the end that this land may forever remain a land of liberty, the Democratic party is opposed to all secret, political organizations, and to all political proscription on account of religious opinion." If language has any meaning this applies as much to Sunday laws as to the American Protective Association, whose movements lately in this State called it forth. There is some hope that all this madness may yet cease before a season of general religious persecution sets in in this country, the last refuge of religious liberty.

Hoping for the better, I am your brother in the fight for religious liberty to the end,

WM. P. TOLLEY.
