RIDPATH, in his "Cyclopedia of Universal History," Vol. 2, page 617, says:

No better summary has ever been presented of the whole situation than that given by the candid and sober-minded Guzot:

"What," says he, "are the reproaches constantly applied to the Reformation by its enemies? Which of its results are thrown in its face as it were as unaneverable."

The two principal reproaches are, first, the multiplicity of sects, the excessive license of thought, the destruction of all spiritual authority, and the entire dissolution of religious society; secondly, tyranny and persecution. "You provoked licentiousness," it has been said, to the Reformers—"you produced it; and after having been the cause of it you wish to restrain and repress it. And how do you repress it? By the most harsh and violent means. You take upon yourselves, too, to punish harsey, and that by virtue of an illegitimate authority."

If we take a review of all the principal charges which have been made against the Reformation, we shall find, if we set aside all questions purely doctrinal, that the above are the two fundamental reproaches to which they may all be reduced.

These charges gave great embarrassment to the Reform party. When they were taxed with the multiplicity of their sects, instead of advocating the freedom of religious opinion, and maintaining the right of every sect to entire toleration, they denounced sectarianism, lamented it, and endeavored to find an excuse for its existence. Were they accused of persecution? They were troubled to defend themselves; they used the plea of necessity; they had, they said, the right to repress and punish error, because they were in possession of the truth. Their articles of belief, they contended, and their institutions were the only legitimate ones; and if the Church of Rome had not the right to punish the Reform Party, it was because she was in the wrong and they in the right.

And when the charge of persecution was applied to the ruling party in the Reformation, not by its enemies, but by its own offspring; when the sects denounced by that party and, "We are doing just what you did; we separate ourselves from you just as you separated yourselves from the Church of Rome," this ruling party were still more at a loss to find an answer, and frequently the only answer they had to give was an increase of severity.

The truth is, that while laboring for the destruction of absolute power in the spiritual order, the religious revolution of the sixteenth century was not aware of the true principles of intellectual liberty. It emancipated the human mind, and yet pretended still to govern it by laws. In point of fact, it produced the prevalence of free inquiry; in point of principle, it believed it was substituting a legitimate for an illegitimate power. It had not looked up to the primary motive, nor down to the ultimate consequence of its own work. It then fell into a double error. On the one side it did not know or respect all the rights of human thought; at the very moment it was demanding these rights for itself, it was violating them toward others. On the other side, it was unable to estimate the rights of authority in matters of reason. I do not speak of coercive authority which ought to have no rights at all in such matters, but of that kind of authority which is purely moral and acts solely by its influence upon the mind. In most re-formed countries something is wanting to complete the proper organization of intellectual society, and to the regular action of old and regular opinions. What is due to and required by traditional belief has not been reconciled with what is due to and required by freedom of thinking; and the cause of this, undoubtedly is, that the Reformation did not fully comprehend and accept its own principles and results.

If our National Reformers of the nineteenth century would turn away their eyes from their schemes for coercing others into their ways they might be made to see that they, too, have failed to comprehend the true principles of the Reformation and their results. They might see that while they demand full and perfect freedom of religious action for themselves, they deny such freedom to others. They might see that they like their half-reformed predecessors have failed to appreciate the true principles of intellectual and religious liberty, and then they would begin to know that they had not yet looked up to the primary motive, nor down to the ultimate consequences of their own work. If the logic of history will not convince them, what will?
