JUST before going to press, the following telegram was received from Gainesville, Ga.:—

Enforcement against Keck and McCutchen quashed and case dismissed.

Eld. W. A. McCutchen and Prof. E. C. Keck, both Seventh-day Adventists, were arrested for disturbing the peace by doing common labor on Sunday, and arraigned before the mayor of Gainesville and fined $50. The case was appealed. Later the parties were indicted by the grand jury and tried for violating the Sunday law. The jury disagreed. The telegram announces the result of the second trial.
