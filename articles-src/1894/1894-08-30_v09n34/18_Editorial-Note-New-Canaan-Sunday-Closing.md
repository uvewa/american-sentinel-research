THE SUNDAY closing mania has reached the town of New Canaan, Conn. A society has been organized among the church people, and on a recent Sunday the proprietors of butcher shops, groceries, drug stores, news stands, and livery stables were arrested and their places of business closed. Later a compromise was effected by which the butcher shops and groceries are allowed to keep open until eleven o'clock. There is still war between the society and the druggists and liverymen. The liverymen say if their business is interfered with in the future, they will arrest any church member or person who rides out on Sunday, save to and from church, since the law says no one shall "engage in any sport or recreation on Sunday."
