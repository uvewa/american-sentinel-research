### THE New York AMERICAN SENTINEL says:—

The right of men to quit work whenever for any cause they see fit to do so cannot be denied without destroying liberty.

We deny that such right exists except in a limited and restricted sense. When men are engaged upon an employment that if suddenly suspended will work serious injury to the employer or the public, and when the very nature of the work is one necessarily of continuity, there is a moral obligation, an implied contract, to not quit work without giving reasonable notice so that others may be employed to fill the places to be made vacant. An implied contract is as binding, morally, as a specific one. It is no destruction of liberty to insist that workmen shall fairly and faithfully execute implied as well as specific contracts with employers.—Washington Chronicle.

The Chronicle is quite right in its criticism of our unqualified statement. However, we did not mean by the term "whenever," that the engineer could abandon his train between stations, or the teamster his employer's horses at the market-place. We had in mind the right of the laborer to cease work with a view of bettering his condition either with his old employer or with a new one. We recognize the "moral obligation," modifying the "whenever" of our statement, and should have expressed it. However, if the "moral obligation" of employer to employ were universally recognized, it would materially reduce the number of strikes.
