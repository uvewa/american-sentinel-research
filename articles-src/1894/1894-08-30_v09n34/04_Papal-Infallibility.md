[This matter first appeared in an anonymous pamphlet published and circulated in Italy immediately following the Vatican council of 1870, which proclaimed the dogma of papal infallibility. The pamphlet purported to be a speech delivered in the council "by a bishop," against the dogma. However it is not published on the strength of its having been delivered "by a bishop," for this is denied, but it is reprinted solely on its own merits, scriptural, logical, and historical.]

**VENERABLE FATHERS AND DIETHREN:** It is not without trembling, yet with a conscience free and tranquil before God, who lives and sees me, that I open my mouth in the midst of you in this august assembly. From the time that I have been sitting here with you, I have followed with attention the speeches that have been made in the hall, hoping with great desire, that a ray of light, descending from on high, might enlighten the eyes of my understanding, and permit me to vote the canons of this holy Ecumenical Council with perfect knowledge of the case. Penetrated with the feelings of responsibility, for which God will demand of me an account, I have set myself to study with the most serious attention, the writings of the Old and New Testaments, and I have asked these venerable monuments of truth to make known to me if the holy pontiff, who presides there, is truly the successor of Saint Peter, vicar of Jesus Christ, and the infallible doctor of the church. To resolve this grave question, I have been obliged to ignore the present state of things, and to transport myself in mind, with the evangelical torch in my hand, to the days when there was neither Ultramontanism nor Gallicanism, and in which the Church had for doctors St. Paul, St. Peter, St. James, and St. John—doctors to whom no one can deny the divine authority, without putting in doubt that which the Holy Bible, which is before me, teaches me, and which the Council of Trent has proclaimed as the rule of faith and of morals. I have, then, opened those sacred pages. Well, shall I dare to say it? I have found nothing, either near or far, which sanctions the opinions of the Ultramontanes. And still more, to my very great surprise, I find no question in the apostolic days of a pope, successor to St. Peter, and vicar of Jesus Christ, no more than of Mahomet, who did not then exist. You, Monsignor Manning, will say that I blaspheme; you, Monsignor Fie, that I am mad. No, monsignori, I do not blaspheme, and I am not mad. Now, having read the whole New Testament, I declare before God, with my hand raised to that great crucifix, that I have found no trace of the papacy as it exists at this moment. Do not refuse me your attention, my venerable brethren, and with your murmurings and interruptions do not justify those who say, like Father Hyacinthe, that this council is not free, but that our votes have been from the beginning ordered (in precedenza imposti). If such were the case, this august assembly, on which the eyes of the whole world are turned, would fall into the most shameful discredit. If we wish to make it great, we must be free. I thank his excellency, Monsignor Dupanloup, for the sign of approbation which he makes with his head; that gives me courage, and I go on.

Reading, then, the sacred books with that attention with which the Lord has made me capable, I do not find one single chapter, or one little verse, in which Jesus Christ gives to St. Peter the mastery over the apostles, his fellow-workers. If Simon, son of Jonas, had been what we believe his holiness, Pius IX., to be today, it is wonderful that he had not said to him, "When I have ascended to my Father, you should all obey Simon Peter as you obey me. I establish him my vicar upon earth."

Not only is Christ silent on this point, but so little does he think of giving a head to the Church that, when he promises thrones to his apostles, to judge the twelve tribes of Israel (Matt. 19:28) he promises them twelve, one for each, without saying that among these thrones one shall be higher than the others—which shall belong to Peter. Certainly, if he had wished that it should be so, he would have said it. What do we conclude from this sentence? Logic tells us that Christ did not wish to make St. Peter the head of the apostolic college. When Christ sent the apostles to conquer the world, to all he gave the promise of the Holy Spirit. Permit me to repeat it; if he had wished to constitute Peter his vicar, he would have given him the chief command over his spiritual army. Christ—so says the Holy Scripture—forbade Peter and his colleagues to reign or to exercise lordship, or to have authority over the faithful, like the kings of the Gentiles (St. Luke 29:25). If St. Peter had been elected pope, Jesus would not have spoken thus, because, according to our tradition, the papacy holds in its hands two swords, symbols of spiritual and temporal power. One thing has surprised me very much. Turning it over in my mind, I said to myself, if Peter had been elected pope, would his colleagues have been permitted to send him with St. John to Samaria to announce the gospel of the Son of God? What do you think, venerable brethren, if at this moment we permitted ourselves to send his holiness, Pius IX., and his excellency Mont Plantier to go to the patriarch of Constantinople to pledge him to put an end to the eastern schism? But here is another still important fact: an Ecumenical Council is assembled at Jerusalem to decide on the questions which divide the faithful. Who would have called together this council if St. Peter had been pope? St. Peter. Who would have presided over it? St. Peter or his legates. Who would have formed or promulgated the canons? St. Peter. Well, nothing of this occurred. The apostle assisted at the council, as all the others did, and it was not he who summed up, but St. James; and when the decrees were promulgated, it was in the name of the apostles, the elders, and the brethren. Acts 15. Is it true that we do in our church? The more I examine, O venerable brethren, the more I am convinced that in the Scriptures the son of Jonas does not appear to be first.

Now, while we teach that the church is built upon St. Peter, St. Paul, whose authority cannot be doubted, says in his epistle to the Ephesians (2:20), it is built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus himself being the chief corner-stone. And the same apostle believes so little in the supremacy of St. Peter, that he openly blames those who say "we are of Paul," "we are of Apollos" (1 Cor. 1:12), as those who would say, we are of Peter. If, therefore, this last apostle had been the vicar of Christ, St. Paul would have taken great care not to censure so violently those who belonged to his own colleague. The same apostle, counting up the offices of the church mentions apostles, prophets, evangelists, doctors, and pastors. Is it to be believed, my venerable brethren, that St. Paul, the great apostle of the Gentiles, would have forgotten the first of these offices, the papacy, if the papacy had been of divine institution? This forgetfulness appeared to me as impossible as if an historian of this council were not to mention one word of his holiness Pius IX. (Several voices—"Silence, heretic, silence.") Calm yourselves, my brethren, I have not yet finished. Forbidding me to go on, you show yourselves to the world to do wrong, and to shut the mouth of the smallest member of this assembly. I continue.

The Apostle Paul makes no mention, in any of his letters directed to the various churches, of the primacy of Peter. If this primacy had existed—if, in one word, the Church had in its body a supreme head, infallible in teaching, would the great apostle of the Gentiles have forgotten to mention it? What do I say? He would have written a long letter on this all-important subject. Then, when as he has actually done, the edifice of the Christian doctrine is erected, would the foundation, the key of the arch, be forgotten? Now, unless you hold that the Church of the Apostles was heretical, which none of us would either desire or dare to say, we are obliged to confess that the Church has never been more beautiful, more pure, or more holy than in the days when there was no pope. (Cries of "it is not true, it is not true.") Let not Monsignor di Laval say, "No." Since if any of you, my venerable brethren, should dare to think that the church which has to-day a pope for its head is more firm in the faith, more pure in its morals than the Apostolic Church, let him say it openly in the face of the universe, since this in-desure is the centre from which our words fly from pole to pole. I go on.

Neither in the writings of St. Paul, St. John, or St. James have I found a trace or germ of the papal-power, St. Luke the historian of the missionary tours of the apostles, is silent on this all-important point. The silence of these holy men, whose writings make part of the canon of the divinely inspired Scriptures, has appeared to me burdensome and impossible if Peter had been pope, and as unjustifiable as if Thiers, writing the history of Napoleon Bonaparte, had omitted the title of emperor. I see there before me a member of the assembly who says, pointing at me with his finger, "There is a schismatic bishop who has got among us under false colors." No, no, my venerable brethren, I have not entered this august assembly as a thief by the window, but by the door like yourselves. My title of bishop gave me the right to it, as my Christian conscience forces me to speak and to say that which I believe to be true. That which has surprised me most, and which, moreover, is capable of demonstration, is the silence of St. Peter. If the apostle had been what we proclaim him to be—that is, the vicar of Jesus Christ on the earth—he surely would have known it; if he had known it, how is it that not once did he act as pope? He might have done it on the day of Pentecost when he pronounced his first sermon and did not do it; neither in the two letters directed to the Church. Can you imagine such a pope, my venerable brethren, if St. Peter had been the pope? Now, if you wish to maintain that he was the pope, the natural consequence arises that you must maintain that he was ignorant of the fact. Now, I ask whoever has a head to think, and a mind to reflect, are those two suppositions possible?

To return. I say, while the apostles lived, the Church never thought that there could be a pope; to maintain the contrary, all the sacred writings must have been thrown to the flames, or entirely ignored.

(To be continued.)
