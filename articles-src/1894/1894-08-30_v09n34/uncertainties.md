# Uncertainties Log - v09n34 (1894-08-30)

## OCR Corrections Made

### Page 2, "The Regency of God on Earth"
- **OCR read:** "Inscientific proud of strength"
- **Corrected to:** "Inscientific proud of strength" (retained as appears to be intentional archaic usage or OCR error, but unclear - may be "Insciently" or similar)
- **Confidence:** LOW - unusual word construction, but preserved as written

### Page 2, "The Regency of God on Earth"
- **OCR read:** "May the divine money upset these dark designs"
- **Corrected to:** "May the divine money upset these dark designs" (retained but seems likely should be "mercy" not "money")
- **Confidence:** LOW - "money" seems incorrect in context, likely "mercy" but preserved OCR reading

### Page 2, "The Rights of Conscience"
- **OCR read:** "Fleas.—'In bar of trial.'"
- **Corrected to:** "Fleas.—'In bar of trial.'" (retained - likely "Plea" but following exact OCR)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - clear OCR error, should be "Plea" but preserved original

### Page 4, line 180
- **OCR read:** "Vol. 9, No. 31."
- **Corrected to:** "Vol. 9, No. 34."
- **Confidence:** HIGH - obvious error, issue is 34 not 31

### Page 5, "Reflections on the Results of the Reformation"
- **OCR read:** "unaneverable"
- **Corrected to:** "unaneverable" (retained - likely "unanswerable")
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - preserved OCR but likely error

### Page 5, "Reflections on the Results of the Reformation"
- **OCR read:** "harsey" (in context of "punish harsey")
- **Corrected to:** "harsey" (retained - likely "heresy")
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - preserved OCR but likely error

### Page 5, "Reflections on the Results of the Reformation"
- **OCR read:** "in-desure"
- **Corrected to:** "in-desure" (retained - likely "enclosure" or similar)
- **Confidence:** LOW - unclear what correct word should be

## Notes
