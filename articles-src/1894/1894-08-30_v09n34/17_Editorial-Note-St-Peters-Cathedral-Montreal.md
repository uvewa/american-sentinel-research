IT WAS FOR THE BUILDING OF ST. PETER'S cathedral in Rome that indulgences were sold in the 16th century. Martin Luther protested, and the Reformation followed. An exact copy of the church at Rome, one-eighth its size, is being erected in Montreal, Quebec, and indulgences are sold to raise the money with which to defray the expenses of construction. Will there be a reformation in Quebec in the 19th century?
