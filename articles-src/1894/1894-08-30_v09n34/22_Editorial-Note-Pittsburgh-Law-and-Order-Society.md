THE LAW and Order Society of Pittsburg, Pa., has not been active for sometime, and as the Christian Statesman puts it, "Sabbath desecration has increased to such an extent that a movement has been begun among the young people's societies of the various denominations to organize the entire better element of the two cities, [Pittsburg and Allegheny] into an immense Law and Order Society. Every minister in Pittsburg, is said to be committed to the support of the undertaking." Of course the Sunday ministers are committed to the support of the movement; having no divine warrant for Sunday observance, and no divine law to bind the consciences of the people to it, they are ever ready to avail themselves of the services of the State to uphold their dogma.
