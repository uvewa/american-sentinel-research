It has long been customary in this country to open political assemblages, conventions, etc., by prayer. At the national capital a chaplain is employed and paid from the public funds for this purpose, while in the State legislatures it is a sort of compliment passed around among the various sects, each prayer costing the taxpayers $5; at least this is true in some States. Many cases where remarkable political prayers have been offered are on record, and the writer not long since saw a collection of them covering several columns of a newspaper.

There is on record the fact that forty years ago, at the first sitting of the Iowa legislature at Des Moines, a certain minister, Mr. Shinn, by name, who, with his family, was just removing to this State in a covered wagon, happened that morning to be in the city, and was asked by a friend, who was a member of the legislature, to come up and offer prayer. This he consented, somewhat reluctantly, however, to do, and then asked if there was anything special that it was desired that he should pray for. The reply was that the only consideration was that the prayer be brief; whereupon he opened the session with a prayer containing just thirty-four words. Its pointedness and brevity was so marked that it was immediately voted that the elder be allowed $10 for that prayer; but which he refused to accept at the time, and now, after all these years, it has been suggested that a warrant be issued to him for the amount with all the accrued interest, seeing that he is greatly advanced in years and in limited circumstances.

In 1872, one, Rev. Mr. Wilson, then a pastor of the Wesley Chapel in this city, opened the Republican State Convention with a prayer that secured for him some notoriety, in which he prayed for 40,000 majority, and added, "Yes, Lord, if it please thee, make it 80,000." For a moment the audience was stunned at the words, but finally broke out in the wildest applause. These and other prayers of like character are called to mind by the remarkable prayer that was made at the opening of the Republican State Convention just held in this city, by Rev. Mr. Weaver, a Christian minister and pastor of one of the churches of that denomination here, which was as follows:

O Lord, we believe that it is fitting that this meeting should be opened with prayer, for we need here to-day to name the men who shall be our standard beavers to lead us to victory. But as we meet here in joy and gladness there comes a shadow of sorrow over our thoughts when we remember that the great Democratic party, which has so aimlessly held us for so many years with such bull dog tenacity, is about to retire into innocuous demeanor, to appear upon the stage of our country no more forever, and when we stand by its open grave and bear the clods fall upon its coffin lid, may we throw the mantle of charity over its faults and remember it only by the good it has done, if, perchance, it has done good enough to elicit our memory.

O Lord, give us wisdom for the guidance of our deliberations to-day, and grant victory to the cause. Amen.

At the point where he referred to the "bull-dog tenacity" of the incumbent political party, there was an outburst of applause, which the chairman sought to quell with his gavel, but without effect, and when the "amen" was said, the vast audience of three thousand people engaged in a storm of applause that was deafening.

The press, generally, have commented on it, some pro, and some con, some declaring that it was the "hit" of the convention, a "corker," and such like expressions, while others denounce it as little less than blasphemy.

The question arises, is this prayer not more of a mockery than otherwise? and are not such prayers as these fair samples of what State chaplaincy is liable to degenerate into? Is it not unchristian and un-American, and should the practice not be abolished?
