WHITESTONE, L. I., not far from this city, has undertaken a crusade against Sunday excursions. There are in the cities of New York and Brooklyn, with their nearly three millions of people, tens of thousands who are dependent upon their daily labor and who have no opportunity for recreation except on Sunday. These flock to the seashore and to the various resorts on Sunday. Hitherto Whitestone has received its share. In order to stop this the council of that village passed an ordinance prohibiting the landing of excursionists there on any day. On Sunday, August 19, the police made a partially successful effort to enforce the "law." The Law and Order League is back of the movement, which is in the interests of Sunday sacredness. The Supreme Court has since enjoined the village authorities from interfering with excursionists.
