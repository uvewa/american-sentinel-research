On July 18, last, the International Religious Liberty Association sent a statement from the Chicago Herald of July 14, in regard to the Capps case in Tennessee, to several thousand newspapers in the United States and Canada. A large number of these papers published the facts in the case. Many of these notices were accompanied by editorial references to the principles involved. A consideration of the various positions taken upon the question of religious liberty as involved in this case is deeply interesting, being illustrative to some extent of the popular idea of religious liberty.

The Republican, of Springfield, Mass., after giving the details of the conviction of Mr. Capps, dismisses the subject with the truthful remark that "apparently the case is one of religious persecution and disgraces Tennessee."

The Sentinel, of L'Anse, Mich., refers to the case as a striking commentary on modern civilization, and asks the question, "Is this a land of religious liberty?" and immediately proceeds to answer it by saying, "It would seem that it makes a heap of difference to what church one belongs, whether he is to enjoy religious liberty or not."

The Democrat, Caro, Mich., becomes facetious over the matter, and adds: "If the law were not ex post facto we should expect to hear of the Deity being arraigned before the Tennessee courts." As ridiculous as this seems, another paper, the Evening Press, of Ogden, Utah, in all seriousness, proceeds to do this very thing and places a Rev. Mr. Gifford upon the stand in proof of the charge that Christ himself was a chronic Sabbath-breaker. This paper, however, gives evidence of a considerable degree of insight into the situation by pointing out that the law of Tennessee, under which Mr. Capps was convicted, is in direct conflict with the letter and the spirit of the Constitution of the United States and of the Declaration of Independence, which prohibits interference with the rights of conscience, and stating that American law does not attempt to prescribe how the American citizen, or an alien, shall employ his time. Each, so long as their action does not work an injury to the State should be allowed to worship God at the time, in the manner, and wherever they please. The Press asks for others what it demands for itself, that the spirit of the Constitution shall be respected, and all alike be protected in their constitutional and inherent rights.

The Evening Standard, of New Bedford, Mass., finds some extenuating circumstances in the case which should appeal to the tender mercies of the Tennessee judges, but thinks after all, that Mr. Capps should be grateful that the sentence of the Mosaic law, that the Sabbath-breaker should be stoned, was not imposed upon him.

The Evening Journal, of Ottawa, Canada, regards the conviction of Mr. Capps as a commendable effort on the part of the State of Tennessee to uphold a desirable civil and social regulation, rather than a religious dogma, and says that it cannot therefore be persecution. The necessity for such a law as the State of Tennessee has, according to the Journal, is due to the fact that the selfish desire of one man to get ahead in business, if unrestrained, would lead others to deny themselves needed rest. If the State should ask Mr. Capps to work on his Sunday (meaning the seventh day of the week), that would be persecution sure enough. It suggests that a person in this dilemma should observe two weekly days of rest, and that the satisfaction to be derived from the thought that he was assisting in the "maintenance of that dear day whose quiet is a godsend and a blessing to tens of millions of toilers," would be ample compensation for his loss of time and money in so doing. While giving Mr. Capps credit for being an honest man, it adds that unwittingly he seems to have done his best to accomplish a grave injury to his fellow human beings.

Under the heading, "Anarchy not Liberty," the Inland Sentinel, of Kamloops, B. C., says: "In this country, where people believe the laws are to be obeyed, Mr. Capps will get little sympathy. He worked on Sunday with his eyes open, was fined, the supreme court of Tennessee upheld the conviction—where the injustice?" For one to question the constitutionality of any law, or to oppose religious dogmas when supplemented by civil law, is denounced as anarchy pure and simple. The remedy, if the minority are unable to secure a modification of such laws and are aggrieved thereby, is for the dissatisfied ones to form a little colony of their own.

The Register, of Sandusky, Ohio, says that it is time for a revolution in Tennessee, and that such a law as that under which Mr. Capps was convicted is not only a travesty on justice but a violation of the Constitution of the United States, which guarantees to every man freedom of religious worship. The offense charged against Mr. Capps was in no way an interference with the rights of his neighbors, and in violation of no principle on which the Constitution was founded. The Tennessee law under which Mr. Capps was convicted is declared to be in violation of the Constitution of the United States, and, being such, would not stand for a moment in any northern State. In Connecticut, even, no man would be arrested and sent to jail for working on Sunday, provided he observed Saturday, or any other day of the week, as the Sabbath.

The Enterprise, Belle Vernon, Pa., can see nothing prejudicial to religious liberty in Mr. Capps not being allowed to desecrate the Sabbath (Sunday), and says it is better to keep two days than to have no Sabbath at all.

The Canadian Baptist, Toronto, says that the question of which this case is an illustration, is a very difficult one. If the State is proceeding upon religious grounds, and its law is based on a religious dogma, it is clearly a case of religious persecution. If, on the other hand, the State Sunday law is enacted and enforced simply on physiological and sociological grounds, it is evident that it would be very difficult to make exceptions without injuring the enforcement of the law. Ordinarily the loss of the second day each week is the price which those at variance with the majority have to pay in order to live as their conscience dictates. The fact that the commandment says "six days shall thou labor" is referred to as adding to the difficulty which the Canadian Baptist experiences in thus disposing of the question. It finds some consolation, however, in the thought that the requirement of the commandment is, after all, an individual matter, in which the Canadian Baptist is not specially concerned, but it asks, in the interests of humanity, why an exemption should not be made in the case of one who observes the seventh as a day of rest.

The Four Corners, Wheailand, Cal., asks, "Is it possible in America, the land of religious liberty, in this the era of progress, of enlightenment, of research, of tolerance, to find one State whose laws, if executed, would result as in this case of Mr. Capps?" It declares that so long as a law of this nature remains upon the statute books of Tennessee, it should be ignored as a State, and calls upon the governor of that commonwealth, if he has any use for the prerogative of pardon, to set this man at liberty.

The Times-Democrat, New Orleans, reviewing the case says it is very plain that the religious freedom of which we are wont to boast with a considerable degree of effusiveness in this country, is very much of a myth. It is not religious freedom at all; it is the freedom or license of a majority of the population to tyrannize over a minority because the religious views and practices of the minority do not conform to the religious views and practices of the majority.

Quotations of this kind might be greatly multiplied, but enough have been given to show the trend of public sentiment. The press may be considered as representing, to a very large extent, the popular view upon any subject, and it is worthy of notice that a conviction of this character, the injustice of which appeals to the intelligence of every one who has a right conception of the fundamental principles of religious liberty, finds so many defenders. The religious press, while deploring persecutions for conscience' sake in other lands, have little to say with regard to the spirit of intolerance which is being manifested in our own country. Is it not time for every individual who appreciates the blessings of civil and religious liberty to be awake to the situation?
