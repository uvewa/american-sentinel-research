A SEVENTH-DAY Adventist, a Mr. Capps, citizen of Weakley County, Tenn., did some necessary farm work on a Sunday, he having, according to the rules of his church, given Saturday to worship and religious meditation. He was arrested for working on Sunday, fined, and jailed. He is a poor man, of weak frame. His young wife and four children are, meantime, on the verge of starvation. The New Orleans Times-Democrat denounces the treatment of Mr. Capps as barbarous, unchristian persecution, and is raising a fund for the payment of the fine and costs. The Times-Democrat says:—

And this is religious persecution, at the end of the nineteenth century, as surely as ever religious persecution was practiced either in New England at the end of the eighteenth century, or in Spain at the end of the fifteenth century. Tennessee should make haste to change its laws regulating the "day of rest," they are not in keeping either with the civilized conditions of this part of the world or of this advanced age in the world's history.

We believe the Times-Democrat is right. The Sunday laws, so far as they simply cover the police power of the State to preserve order on the first day of the week, so that worshipers in our churches be not disturbed, are all right. When they propose to compel Quakers, Adventists and others, who worship on other days to keep Sunday, according to the rules of other churches, then these laws are essentially laws restricting both religious liberty and the rights of the citizen. Governor Porter takes the same ground. He defended some Adventists, who were persecuted by bigots in his county, and defeated the persecutors in the courts.—Chattanooga Daily Times, July 29, 1894.
