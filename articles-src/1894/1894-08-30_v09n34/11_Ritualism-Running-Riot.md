A CORRESPONDENT of the Record has been examining popular Ritualist works, and makes some interesting extracts illustrating the Romeward progress. In "The Ceremonial of the Altar," there is a prayer for "Our Pope, our Bishop, our Sovereign." Is the pope at Rome or Canterbury? A little book, instructing English churchmen in the use of the rosary, has references to "The Repose of the Mother of God." "Simple Lessons," by Canon Carter, suggests that Paul's cloak, left at Troas, was his eucharistic vestment, and that the many lights in the upper chamber at Troas, during Paul's preaching, were, "most likely," "burning to give honor to the blessed sacrament which was going to be celebrated in the early morning." "A Little Catechism for Little Catholics," drops into poetry, of which a specimen is

Once each month to my confession,
And to my communion go,
At confession I will always
Tell out every sin I know.

"Children at the Altar" gives hymns, of which this is a verse:—

O, see! within a creature's hand
The vast Creator deigns to be
Reposing, infant like, as though
On Joseph's arm or Mary's knee.
Sweet sacrament, we thee adore,
O make us love thee more and more.

"The Catholic Religion," by Mr. Vernon Stacey, openly mourns the loss of extreme unction, the ceremony for which is introduced. "The Ceremonial at the Altar" is very explicit on the subject of fasting before communion. It warns the priest that the taking of a lozenge, or the sipping of a glass of water, breaks a fast as effectually as a hearty meal. The "Directorium Anglicanum" goes farther and enjoins that the priest shall not even cleanse his teeth, nor wash his mouth before mass, lest the taste of water mingle with his saliva. And it is a body that encourages such views which is at the back of the clericals on the London school board.—New York Observer.
