"Now in Jail for Conscience' Sake" is the title of the November number of the Religious Liberty Library. It is an 8-page tract giving an account of the trial and imprisonment of Robert R. Whaley and W. G. Curlett, Seventh-day Adventists, of Queen Anne's Co., Md., for doing "bodily labor on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday." This tract ought to have a wide circulation, not only in Maryland, but in every State in the Union. One State tract society has already ordered twenty-five thousand, and another 10,000 copies. Let the good work go on. Single copy, one cent; usual discount in quantities. Order of this office.
