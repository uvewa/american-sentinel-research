THE very splendid obsequies of the late Czar of Russia are partly the expression of the faith of the Eastern Church, and perhaps more fully the outflow of the density of European civilization, requiring large expression, needing much time for utterance. For weeks the members of royal families were held under the spell of funereal surroundings, while the great powers of the world mourned and prayed in concert on the day of burial in many lands and cities. The most solemn services were concurrently held. All nations have recognized and worshiped with the Russian Church. This is itself a Christian alliance, a religious union. Coming so near the conference between the Greek and Latin churches at the Vatican, the whole world is impressed. A new feeling of human brotherhood is awakened; a revival of religious sentiment which is at once deep and tolerant of others has had place among men.—The Evangelist, Nov. 22, 1894
