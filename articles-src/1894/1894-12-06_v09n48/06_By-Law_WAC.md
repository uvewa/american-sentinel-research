The Council of the Churches, the Christian Elector's Association, the Evangelical Alliance, the Lord's Day Observance Society, and the like, are associations organized quite recently for the purpose of protecting Sunday as a day of rest and worship—by law.

They desire to secure, as far as possible, the cooperation of all churches, Sunday-schools, Young Men's Christian Associations, Woman's Christian Temperance Unions, Epworth Leagues, Labor Unions, political parties, and individuals everywhere, who believe in preserving Sunday as a day of rest and worship—by law.

They see a growing disregard for Sunday as a day of rest and worship, and they desire that this shall be remedied—by law.

Believing secular work on Sunday—though legitimate enough in itself—to be irreligious, they ask that this shall be discontinued—by law.

They fear also that many are working too hard for their health, and therefore wish to persuade them to take more rest—by law.

They complain that Sunday trains, Sunday newspapers, and Sunday amusements interfere with church attendance, and consequently recommend that all places of business—except churches—be closed on Sunday—by law.

They do not intend by this, they say, to compel any one to attend church, but simply to extend a cordial invitation for such attendance—by law.

From the growing carelessness in regard to Sunday observance, and the laxity in church attendance, they see that many are becoming irreligious, and they simply desire to stop this irreligious tendency—by law.

Hence, they urge all persons who believe in upholding this weekly rest-day—by law—to do all in their power—by law—to create sentiment in favor of—such laws.

They do not intend to persecute, but simply to compel others to conform to their ideas of religion—by law.

In short, they believe in moral suasion—by law.

Therefore they pray the Lord to assist them in this work of inducing the people to keep Sunday—by law.

They petition the legislature to help them on—by law.

They ask civil magistrates to teach the people that Sunday is the Sabbath—by law.

They ask for everything but—a divine Sunday law.

This they know is not to be found, and hence they ask Parliament to pass—a Sunday law.

So readeth the first and last chapters of Sunday legislation. W. A. COLCORD.

Melbourne, Australia.
