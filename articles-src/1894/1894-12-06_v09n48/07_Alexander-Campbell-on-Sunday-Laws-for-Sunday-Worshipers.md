[In 1820 there was organized in West Middletown, Washington Co., Pa., a society, called the West Midlothian Morel Society. The principal object of the society was to enforce the Pennsylvania Sunday law of 1784, which is still on the statute books of the State. This Morel Society was organized by the United Presbyterians, the same people who, later in 1863, organized the National Reform Association. Alexander Campbell, the founder of the Christian or Disciple Church, ably opposed the society in a series of articles published in the Reporter, of Washington, county seat of Washington County. His articles were signed "Candidus." A United Presbyterian minister, by the name of Wylie, attempted to defend the society, and signed himself "Timothy." The discussion continued from April 17, 1820, the date of Mr. Campbell's first article, to February 22, 1823, during which time almost every phase of the compulsory Sunday law question was treated. As a result the Moral Society perished, not to appear again until 1863 when it was revived by the same denomination under the name, National Reform Association. Every word of Mr. Campbell's invincible logic and withering denunciation is applicable to the association, resuscitated under the name, National Reform Association, and kindred organizations, such as the American Sabbath Union, the Pennsylvania Sabbath Association, etc.]

MR. TIMOTHY complained that I have not noticed his seven arguments in favor of coercing certain persons to pay some regard to the first day. I did not think that he called them arguments until his last numbers appeared. We shall, since he has defined them with this title, examine every one of them. We shall take up one of them now. His first argument is (No. 7), How could men enjoy the privilege ("of worshiping God in public on the Sabbath") if all those who do not count it their privilege were permitted to pursue their ordinary business on the Sabbath? How could those who inhabit large cities worship God without disturbance amid the clinking of hammers and rattlings of drays, etc.? Hence the necessity of coercion. I ask, How do the Presbyterians of all sects, Episcopalians, and Catholics in all our large cities go through all the forms of their devotion on the fast days, preparation Saturdays, and sacramental Mondays? How do synods, presbyteries, councils, meet and worship, and transact ecclesiastical business on week days, amidst the common business of the cities? How do they worship God in their families, morning and evening, every week day, amidst the same confusion? If they can worship in these circumstances one day they may another, I argue; and I argue that if it is right to oblige all the citizens to make no noise on the Lord's day, that we may have the privilege of worshiping in quietness, then it is right to oblige them to abstain from business on all our week day meetings, and while we worship in our families, lest we should be disturbed in our devotion. I argue that if the Presbyterian should oblige us to be quiet on his fast day, then the Episcopalian should oblige us to observe his Christmas day, the Catholic his Good Friday, and the Jew his seventh day. Where is Mr. T.'s first argument now? I wonder how the primitive Christians in Jerusalem, in Rome, in Corinth, in Ephesus, in Antioch, populous and pagan cities, could worship God on the first day in the church for so long a time! Shall I pursue the argument further? No, it's vanished. The civil law should protect all congregations on any day from insult or unnecessary interruption, but all beyond this, is unjust and oppressive.

I proceed to a third argument against the system I oppose. It has been said that if faith be a duty of all men, then going to hear the word preached is a previous duty. But the Scriptures say, "The word preached did not profit, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it." So that the Scripture presupposes faith as a prerequisite to hearing the word to advantage. We fully admit that "faith," too, "comes by hearing the Word of God." Yet we cannot admit the propriety of teaching that the unbeliever's first duty, in order to faith, is to go to sermon. The commission under which all true preachers act makes it their duty to go out to all places, into all the world, and to announce the gospel to every creature, not to give out that it is the duty of unbelievers to come to wait on them. Again, parents, who are Christians, are bound to acquaint their children in due time with the gospel, to bring them up in the training or nurture and admonition of the Lord, so that in a professing country every child may, and the majority have an opportunity of hearing the gospel before they are able or capable to understand a learned divine. As soon as the gospel is once announced to any, he is commanded to believe it upon its own evidence; and not to believe it, when fully stated, on its own evidence, is to increase the guilt and aggravate the condemnation of the hearer.

All duties are either mediate or immediate, that is, duties that should be done just now or hereafter. Every man in the world is in duty bound to do everything that God requires of him, but every duty is not to be done at once. A man must first be a husband before it becomes his duty to love his wife; a father before it becomes his duty to love his children; a master before he becomes bound to render unto his servants that which is just and equal. Yet every man is bound to do all these things when he comes into those relations. To say that under the gospel any duty was prior to faith, is to say that infidel duties are prior to faith; to say that hearing, repenting, or reforming are prerequisites to faith, is to say that infidel or faithless hearing, infidel or faithless repenting, infidel or faithless reformation is the immediate duty of all men, and faith the mediate. But if faith be not the immediate duty of all men, then no man can be condemned for not immediately believing. A man might as correctly be told to love his wife who is not yet a husband, as to be told to observe the first day of the week who is not yet a Christian. From all which, it follows: Faith is the immediate duty of every unbeliever to whom divine revelation comes.

But divine revelation has come to every citizen in Pennsylvania. Therefore faith is the immediate duty of every citizen in Pennsylvania who has not yet believed.

If faith be the immediate duty of all unbelievers, then the observance of the Lord's day is not the immediate duty of any unbeliever, for there cannot be two immediate duties.

. . . The gospel commands no duty that can be performed without faith in the Son of God, "Whatsoever is not of faith is sin."

But to command men destitute of faith to observe any Christian institute, such as the Lord's day, is commanding duty to be performed without faith in the Son of God.

Therefore, to command unbelievers, or natural men, to observe in any sense the Lord's day is anti-evangelical or contrary to the gospel.—Candidus (Alexander Campbell), in Washington (Pa.) Reporter, Sept. 17 and 24, 1821.
