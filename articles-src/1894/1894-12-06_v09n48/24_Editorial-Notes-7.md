A NUMBER of American papers have commented upon the imprisonment of Elder H. P. Holser, in Basel, Switzerland, for refusing to close on Sunday the publishing house, of which he is manager. The gist of a few of these comments we give.

The Standard, Toronto, S. D., says in its issue of Nov. 22:—

Then, by police force was he, a Christian minister of the gospel, taken from his work and confined behind prison bars in a room 12x13, for no other reason than because he claimed the right and did worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience.

The Free Press, Mount Pleasant, Iowa, Nov. 15, gives the main facts and says:—

Even in the pure mountain air of Switzerland there seems to be a spirit dominant that would make a residence almost intolerable.

The Sharon (Pa.) Telegraph, of Nov. 14, says of Mr. Holser's case:—

There are very peculiar things that transpire in the older countries as well as here in this, and this is one of them.

The Star, South Bethlehem, Pa., thinks the imprisonment of Elder Holser "an exhibition of intolerance which would seem to be out of place in this age, and particularly in liberty-loving Switzerland," and says:—

It is a poor illustration of freedom when a man is at liberty to do as his conscience dictates only when it leads him to do as others think he ought to do.

We hope Pastor Holser may be released and indemnified, in deference to the spirit of religious liberty.

The opinions thus far quoted are all from secular papers, and we are sorry to say that in such matters the secular press puts to shame the religious press. The Christian Observer, a Presbyterian paper, published in Louisville, Ky., has the following in reference to this case, and its sentiments are quite worthy of the Dark Ages:—

A society calling itself the International Religious Liberty Association sends us the following item of news, with a request that we comment upon it:—

"Word comes to this country from Switzerland, that Pastor H. P. Holser, the American representative of the Seventh-day Adventists in Central Europe, and the director of their publishing house in Basel, is now undergoing a term of sixty one days' imprisonment in that city for allowing work to be done in the office on Sunday. This seems all the more strange, because the 'Continental Sunday' is observed in Basel, as elsewhere in Europe, with noisy revelry. Across the street from the Adventist printing office is the Schutzenglaube, where soldiers parade, and practice target shooting on Sunday. But they have a law, ostensibly and designedly favoring workingmen, which forbids ordinary labor on Sunday. Religious bigotry is able to use this to prevent the free exercise of the conscience."

If it be a fact, as is stated in the paragraph, that very little respect is paid to the Sabbath in Switzerland, and the day is given up in large measure to revelry and amusement, this is no justification for men who profess to be religious to send their agents there to undermine and destroy the remnant of respect which is still paid to the Lord's day by a deliberate violation of those laws of the State which forbid all labor on that day. The anarchists who come from Europe to this country, and who claim that their consciences teach them that it is right to defy the laws of this country which protect property and life, are justly punished for breaking the laws. These religious anarchists who send their agents to foreign countries to inaugurate the practice of laboring on Sunday, in defiance of the Sunday laws which are intended to protect the working men, should be just as severely dealt with. All honor to the authorities and the courts of Basel who have the courage, so strangely lacking in some of our American citizens, to enforce the laws for the protection of the Sabbath and to imprison those who deliberately violate them.

No comment can add to the bitter words of the Christian Observer. The same paper has a note relative to the recent massacre of Armenians by Turks, with the remark that "it is the spirit of Mohammedanism." But how much better is the spirit manifested by this so-called Christian paper? Is its spirit that of Christianity?—Nay, verily; it is the spirit of the papacy, the spirit of antichrist, the spirit that has in all ages persecuted men for conscience' sake; that in the Middle Ages slaughtered men and women by the tens of thousands for their faith; which in the early days of our own country hanged Quakers, whipped Baptists, and banished Roger Williams. And it is this same spirit that will yet decree that as many as will not worship the image of the papacy shall be killed. See Rev. 13.
