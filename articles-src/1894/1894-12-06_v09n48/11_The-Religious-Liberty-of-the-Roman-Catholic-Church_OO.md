At the present time the church of Rome is posing as the defender of civil and religious liberty, and many are liable to be deceived by her pretensions. It is therefore important to have an exact knowledge of the kind of liberty represented by her. Cardinal Gibbons has given us the following definition of religious liberty: "A man enjoys religious liberty when he possesses the free right of worshiping God according to the dictates of a right conscience, and practicing a form of religion most in accordance with his duties to God."*

An exemplification of this kind of liberty was shown recently in Genoa, Vernon Co., Wis. A young lady, member of a Catholic family, who was of age, left home to work for her own maintenance. She had for some time last year been in the employ of a Methodist minister as a domestic. She became somewhat disaffected toward the Catholic Church, and it was reported to her parents. They, of course, set about to the best of their ability to remedy it. In order to get her in their power, and away from her place of work, her mother represented to her that, if she would go and tell the priest what religion she wanted to choose, she should be free afterwards from any obligation to the Catholic Church; but instead of setting her free when she came to him, he declared her to be insane, and preparation was made to take her to the convent at La Crosse, where she could be under surveillance. With team and wagon they started for La Crosse. Three persons went with her, —two women and one man,—to see her safe in the convent. The poor girl had no way of escape, but did the best she could under the circumstances. On the road to La Crosse, they happened to meet the stage going to De Soto and other places with the mail. She called on the driver for protection, and after a hard struggle with her three guards, she escaped from the wagon and took refuge in the stage. They still tried to retake her, but the driver finally drew his revolver and threatened to shoot if they touched her. They desisted, threatening that they would yet have her in their power.

The girl was taken back to her place of work, where she now is, and no evidence of insanity can be seen in her. The only insanity (?) about her is her desire to change her religion. Of course, her conscience was not right and she was not practicing a form of religion most in accordance with her duties to God, according to the idea of the Roman Catholic Church, and so her conscience must be made right, and the practice of religion made to accord with Roman Catholic ideas of her duties to God.

The history of the Catholic Church in all lands and at all times, when her power has not been curtailed, testifies to her faithful adherence to this doctrine. When petty persecution, deception, threats or boycott fails, recourse must be had to more severe means. If Rome will commit this outrage on liberty of conscience now, what will she do when she gets the power which blinded apostate Protestants are putting in her hands? The spirit that seeks to imprison a Catholic girl in a Wisconsin convent because she became a Methodist, is the same spirit that imprisons an ex-Methodist in Maryland because he became a Seventh-day Adventist.
