EMBOLDENED by the indifference of the people, the priests of Rome are to-day denying that "the church" ever persecuted. The Inquisition, it is asserted, was a civil or political tribunal rather than an ecclesiastical court, and that "religion had nothing to do with the massacre" of St. Bartholomew's day in France, but that "Coligny and his fellow Huguenots were slain not on account of their creed, but exclusively on account of their alleged treasonable designs."—Faith of Our Fathers, page 298.
