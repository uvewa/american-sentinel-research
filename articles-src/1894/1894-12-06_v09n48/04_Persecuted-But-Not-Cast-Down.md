[The following letter from the wife of one of the imprisoned Maryland Adventists was sent to the local organ of the denomination, published in this city, from which we take it.]

Church Hill, Md., Nov. 24.

DEAR RECORD: It is with a thankful heart that I address you to-day. For some time I have wanted to write to the friends through you, and tell them what the Lord had done for me. We have had a sweet season of prayer to-day in our Sabbath school. Although two of its members are absent, being imprisoned for their faith, yet the Lord has promised to be with us wherever two or three are gathered together. I know I have the prayers of all Seventh-day Adventists, and have found brothers and sisters among them. I realize to-day more than ever what the dear Saviour suffered when he was here on earth. Since they have taken away my husband and put him behind prison bars, I have consecrated myself to God and am trusting in his Word; and although I may have to suffer very much on account of the treatment I receive from people here, God is preparing for me an eternal home, where I shall never know want. Although I have nothing in this world to call my own, Christ is mine and I feel as rich in his love as if I had all this world contains. I have two children sick at present; one is quite ill, but God is able to bring them through. Pray for your humble sister in the Lord.

ELLA R. WHALEY.
