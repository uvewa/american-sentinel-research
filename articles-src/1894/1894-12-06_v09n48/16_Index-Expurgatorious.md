DURING the month of March last four hundred books, mostly Italian works, were placed upon the Index Exporgatorious by the sacred congregation of the Roman propaganda. However, the once dreaded "Index" has become a mere farce in Italy. Most Italians read what they like, but for those who have conscientious scruples, and even for the priests themselves, there is an easy way out of the difficulty. Any one paying three dollars can obtain a special dispensation, which, for a certain number of years, allows him to read any and everything proscribed by the "Index." A new Italian opera—"The Medici"—which was given without question in Italy, was prohibited in Vienna theaters because it contained allusions that were considered offensive to the papacy.—Foreign Mission Journal.
