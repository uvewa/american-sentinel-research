BRIDGETON, N. J., Nov. 24.—Three Seventh-day Baptists living in Stos Creek township, were arrested a few days ago for gunning on Sunday. They were Joseph Fogg, Edward Thomas and Richard Rainer, and it was expected that when their cases came up before Justice Woodruff they would resist and make an interesting test of the law. The men were charged with having gunned on Sunday, Nov. 11, the day the season for rabbits, quail, etc., opened. As they observed the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath, and as a special provision of the law permits them to gun on their own premises on the first day of the week, the gunners declared that they were innocent of any violation of the statute.

At the hearing it was shown that the offenders had gunned off their own property, and Justice Woodruff imposed a fine of $20 each upon the trio. Rather than take the matter up to a higher court the men paid the fines.—Philadelphia Record, Nov. 25, 1894.
