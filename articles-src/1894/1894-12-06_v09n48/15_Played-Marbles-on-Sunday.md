IT SHOCKED GOOD MR. SCHUMWAY AND HE HAD THE
BOYS ARRESTED.

MR. FRANKLIN SCHUMWAY is a bald-headed Sabbatarian who doesn't allow his little boys to play marbles on Sunday, and does his best to prevent other people's little boys from so enjoying themselves.

Five of these desperate criminals, ranging in age from ten to fourteen, had the temerity to play with "agates" and "long taws" Sunday afternoon in full view of Mr. Schumway's windows, at No. 263 West Fortieth Street. He went out and got Policeman Quinn to arrest them. Quinn protested that they were peaceable, but finally took all five—Edward Ferns, Willie Donovan, Johnnie Byrne, Freddie Barnes and Crawford Pyne—to the West Thirty-seventh Street police station. Then they were taken to the Gerry Society's rooms.

Yesterday Mr. Schumway left his wholesale notion store at No. 51 Lispenard St., long enough to appear in Jefferson Market Police Court to prosecute the boys. To Mr. Schumway's visible dissatisfaction, Justice Hogan didn't seem to realize the enormity of their crime. He merely said: "You had better not play marbles where it will annoy this gentleman. Go home now."

Mr. Schumway was asked what he had to say about one of the little boys who would lose his place as an errand boy through the arrest. He said that was a matter which didn't concern him.—Morning Advertiser, Nov. 20, 1894.
