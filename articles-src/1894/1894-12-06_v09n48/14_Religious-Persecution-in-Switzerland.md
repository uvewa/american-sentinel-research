RELIGIOUS persecution is not restricted to a few States in our own country, as Pennsylvania, Maryland and Tennessee, but now we have word from Switzerland that the sturdy and conservative Germans are waking up to the dangers of having honest, conscientious observers of the Lord's Sabbath in their midst! Pastor H. P. Holser, the American representative of the Seventh-day Adventists in Central Europe, and the director of the publishing house at Basel, is now undergoing a term of sixty-one days' imprisonment in that city for allowing work to be done in his office on Sunday. While this punishment is being inflicted, just across the street from the printing office soldiers parade and practice target shooting on Sunday.

This pastor was taken from his home October 25th and confined in the city prison. But such exhibitions of intolerance are more in keeping with the spirit of most monarchical governments than in a republic where religious liberty is one of the promised blessings and boasted privileges. Our citizens should not be too severe in their strictures on the inhumanity and intolerance of Russia even, until they are sure their own hands are washed from the stains of attempted legislation in favor of Sunday as against the Bible Sabbath and its conscientious observance. Americans should not allow their zeal to so far outstrip their judgment as to equal, if not excel, the intolerance of the land from whence their forefathers fled, seeking religious liberty, nearly three hundred years ago.—The Sabbath Recorder, Nov. 22, 1894.
