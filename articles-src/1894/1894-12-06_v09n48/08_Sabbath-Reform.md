The following is a correspondence from New York to the Dallas News of last Sunday:—

The New York State Sabbath Association held its third annual meeting last night in Brooklyn. Among the other things which the association is trying to bring about is the abolition of all Sunday traffic, Sunday excursions, and Sunday newspapers. The address on the Sunday newspapers was delivered by Dr. Theodore L. Cuyler, who announced himself a true friend of the daily press, which he held responsible for much of the good accomplished in the world, and thought that all the Christians should unite in demanding the suppression of the Sunday newspapers.

"Why," he asked, "should the newspaper men be allowed to carry on their business when all other trades are required to suspend trade on Sunday? There is no need of the Sunday press. We got along very well without it in the oblen days and we could again. While there is no reason why we should have the Sunday papers, there are many reasons why we should be delivered from them. From the cleanest papers issued there are sporting and other topics which are not considerate subjects on the Sabbath. Ministers have to dig out their parishioners from under the avalanche of blanket sheets which are every Sunday launched upon the public."

The sentiment contained in the above article, if spoken fifteen years ago, would have been denounced by all liberal, and fair-minded people, as outrageously commandatory in a land where its people boasted of possessing the privilege of following the dictates of their own consciences in matters of religion and the observance of God's laws. For is not the observance of the Sabbath one of God's laws and not man's? Then to whom are we accountable? Not man, certainly. And is it not blasphemy, then, for one man to endeavor to force another to observe a certain form of worship just because he construes it in that light? Christ forbid civil interference on the Sabbath question time and again, and when the Pharisees consulted him on the compulsory observance of that day, we believe his answer was, "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's." In this it is clearly shown that Christ meant that the Sabbath was a divine and not a civil law, in the enforcement of which, Caesar had no rightful power. Be charitable, allow your neighbor the same right in his form of worship as you should and do demand for yourself in this grand country of freedom and liberty. Just such laws as the above article indorses, caused the destruction and fall of the Roman empire, one of the grandest and richest kingdoms the world has ever known.—Brandon (Texas) Messenger.
