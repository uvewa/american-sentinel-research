[The following is a communication from Hon. T. J. Morgan, touching a letter from Mr. Armstrong, of the Interior Department, published in the SENTINEL of recent date, relative to appropriations received by Baptists for conducting schools among the Indians.]

The following letter from the Indian Office is going the rounds of newspapers, attracting a good deal of attention and provoking a great many inquiries as to the facts in the case:—

Department of the Interior,
Office of Indian Affairs,
Washington, Sept. 12, 1894.

ALLEN MOON,
President International Religious Liberty Ass'n,
738, 9th Street, N. E., Washington, D. C.

Sir:—Referring to our conversation of the 11th inst., relative to contracts for the education of Indian children with the Baptist Church, you are informed that I find records of contracts from the year 1879 to 1884 between this office and Henry L. Morshouse, of New York City, secretary of the American Baptist Home Missionary Society, for the freedmen of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians, in the Indian Territory, as follows:—

In 1879, six day schools, at $875, for six months.
In 1882, one boarding school and eight day schools, at $2,250.
In 1883, one boarding school and eight day schools, at $2,750.
In 1884, four day schools, at $700, and again in the same year, for six schools, at $1,500.

Very respectfully,
FRANK C. ARMSTRONG,
Ass't Com.

Some years ago, as a part of General Grant's so-called "peace policy," various Indian reservations were parceled out among the several religious denominations of the country who were requested to nominate men to take charge of agencies under the Interior Department, and to be paid, of course, by the Government. It was hoped that this method would bring to bear upon the solution of the Indian problem more of religion and less of politics. The scheme was ultimately abandoned as impracticable.

Under this plan the Baptists nominated a man to have charge of the Union Agency, embracing the five so-called civilized tribes in the Indian Territory. There were in this agency between four and five thousand negroes who had been the slaves of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians, but who had been freed by the exigencies of the war. They were not adopted into the Indian tribes and consequently they were political orphans, having no political rights among those who had been their masters, having little property of their own, without schools or any educational facilities whatever. They were ignorant, poverty-stricken, degraded, helpless, and largely hopeless. Their situation was brought to the attention of Rev. Dr. S. S. Cutting, then corresponding secretary of the Home Mission Society, and by him the matter was presented to the secretary of the interior. The result of the correspondence was an invitation from the Government for the Home Mission Society to provide a system of public schools for these people for their secular education, the schools to be established and supervised by the Home Mission Society, but the salaries of the teachers to be paid by the Government.

From the statements from the Indian Office, above cited, it appears that these schools were chiefly day schools, that they continued only for a brief period, that the entire amount of money paid by the Government on their account was $8,075.

From these facts it seems that these schools were not Indian schools at all, but negro schools; they were not mission schools, but public schools; they were part of a general scheme then in operation acquiesced in, apparently, by everybody. There were at that time no other schools for these negroes maintained by the Government.

With the present system of Indian Contract Schools the Baptists, we believe, have had no connection whatever, and have not received from the United States Government a penny in aid of their Indian mission work. They have not asked for, or desired, to participate in the scheme, but have strongly protested against it. Without an exception, so far as we know, the voice of the denomination is clear, explicit, and emphatic in asking that the entire contract system be done away with, because now that the Government schools have been increased and brought to a high degree of efficiency contract schools are unnecessary; because the system is a violation of the spirit, if not the letter, of the Constitution of the United States; because it is antagonistic to the recognized American doctrine of complete separation of Church and State; because its operation involves an invidious partiality for one denomination as against others; because it establishes a vast corruption fund utterly demoralizing in its operations; because it introduces into American politics sectarian bitterness which is greatly to be deprecated; and because it menaces the integrity of the public school fund and the permanence of the entire school system.

It is a significant fact that the great religious denominations, Presbyterian, Congregational, Methodist, and Episcopalian, which have heretofore been sharing in these public subsidies, have by their action condemned the system as un-American and withdrawn from it, leaving the Roman Catholic Church almost solitary and alone in this advocacy of it. This church, during the ten years ending June 30th, 1895, will have received from the public treasury, for the prosecution of its missions among the Indians, more than three millions of dollars and is apparently tenacious in its advocacy of the continuance of this great abuse of public money which should never be used for private or sectarian purposes.

But the contract Indian school system is doomed. It is un-American, unconstitutional, impolitic, needless, and harmful. At its last session Congress virtually condemned it by directing the secretary of the interior to report to its next session whether it cannot be entirely done away with.

T. J. MORGAN.

The SENTINEL was the first paper to publish the facts which have called out Hon. T. J. Morgan's letter, and we are of course very willing to insert this statement from him as a representative Baptist. Sept. 14, 1893 we published a statement to the effect that "the Methodist, the Episcopalian, the Congregationalist, and the Baptist churches" had "all refused to take any more" money from the Government for the support of their Indian schools. When our attention was first called to the statement last September we were persuaded that a mistake had been made. Consequently a frank acknowledgment of what we had come to believe was an injustice to the Baptist denomination was prepared and put in type, but after the matter was in page proof, and but an hour before going to press, the letter from Mr. Armstrong, of the Indian Office, received and forwarded to us by Mr. Moon, came to hand. Of course it changed the complexion of the matter and was inserted instead of our recantation.

Now we have inserted Mr. Morgan's explanation, and the reader can judge for himself as to the part the Baptists have taken in the matter of receiving Government appropriations for work done among the Indians. It is evident that the Baptist denomination received money from the Government under President Grant's administration for some kind of supervision over Indian tribes, and also at a later period it received money for conducting schools for negro freedmen residing among the Indians of the same territory.

Now if there can be such a thing as a religious denomination exercising a purely civil supervision over Indian tribes, and if this is what the Baptist denomination did; —and again, if a religious denomination can conduct public schools entirely on the secular basis, and if this is what the Baptist denomination did, then the Baptist denomination has not violated in this matter the principle of complete separation of Church and State.

One thing is certain, the Baptist denomination has consistently refused to participate in the more recent disgraceful violation of American and Christian principles carried on under the contract school system by all the other leading denominations, both Roman Catholic and Protestant, and has strongly protested against the practice. Let all friends of religious liberty note this fact and give the denomination due credit.

We do not take the hopeful view of the immediate discontinuance of the un-American system which Mr. Morgan does. The Roman Catholic leech, encouraged by "Protestant" example, has embedded itself deeply into the American body politic and will not be easily shaken off. But we shall see what we shall see.
