IN our last issue we stated that the Pennsylvania Grit, published at Williamsport, Pa., which so courageously and effectively gave battle to the Pennsylvania Sabbath Association, at its recent invasion of its beautiful city, was under "liberal Roman Catholic management." This is a mistake. The Pennsylvania Grit is a strictly non-sectarian, non-partisan paper.
