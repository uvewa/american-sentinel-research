The January-February issue of Our Day contains this in its editorial notes:—

Sabbath reform is still needed, although our Waterloo was won in the six victories achieved in the Sabbath-closing of the World's Fair. The gates were officially closed by Congress and court and commission and directory, and we should not make too much of the fact that lawlessness and technicalities nullified the closing. A more serious damper of our joy in victory is the fact that many who petitioned against Sunday opening went to the Fair on Sunday trains, and our appreciation of the act of Congress is dampened by the fact that its chief committee in January, 1894, held a meeting to discuss the tariff bill on the Sabbath day, which is more and more being used here as on the continent, for political purposes by men of both great parties in national and State capitals. One more has been added to the decisions of the State Supreme Courts sustaining the constitutionality of Sabbath laws. The Maryland Court of Appeals, being the court of last resort for the State, on January 25, 1894, decided that the Sabbath law of Maryland, which is one of the most strict, is not in contravention of the national constitutional amendment forbidding the union of Church and State. Judge Boyd, in this case, remarked that a decision would have no less weight

because "in accordance with divine law as well as human." The decision itself accords with the unanimous opinion of the Supreme Court on February 29, 1892, that "this is a Christian nation." That decision and the action of Congress in closing the World's Fair on the Sabbath should logically be followed by the passage of the "Blair Sunday Best Bill," soon to be re-introduced by ex-Senator Blair in the House of Representatives, by which all Sunday work under control of Congress, including the mails and interstate trains, is forbidden. And the Christian amendment introduced in January, 1894, by Congressman E. A. Morse, which puts a recognition of the supreme authority of the law of Christ into the preamble of the national Constitution, is also but a fitting incorporation into fundamental law of the Supreme Court decision that has just been cited.

This shows very well the logical and necessary sequence of each succeeding step in this great iniquity. That the remaining steps will follow is just as sure as that these have been taken. Is it not time for congressmen, legislators, lawyers and citizens, who have ridiculed the possibility of the adoption of any such measures in this country, to wake to an understanding of what is going on and what the result will be?
