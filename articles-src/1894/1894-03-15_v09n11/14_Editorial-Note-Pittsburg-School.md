The Mail and Express is editorially roused over the consolidation of a Catholic parochial school and the Riverside public school, West End, Pittsburg, by which the Sisters of Mercy, heretofore teaching in the parochial school, are transferred to the public school, with their peculiar religious garb and tenets. This the Mail and Express says will make this public school "distinctively a Romanist school." True! But the Mail and Express should have thought of this before. Such a fusion does certainly make a Romanist school. But such a thing is only consistent with what has gone before. There has been a fusion with Roman Catholicism in the enforcement of Sunday observance and religious law which has made this a Romanist country. The Mail and Express should be consistent and repudiate it all.
