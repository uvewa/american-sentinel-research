ROMAN CATHOLICISM is spreading rapidly in the three Scandinavian kingdoms, which have been regarded ever since the days of King Gustavus of Sweden, as the stronghold of Protestantism. So great is the number of proselytes that the Vatican has just placed Denmark, Sweden and Norway under the pastoral care of three bishops. As usual, a feature of the work of propagation is the establishment of parochial schools, where the younger generation of Scandinavians are being educated in accordance with the doctrines of the Catholic Church.—New York Tribune.
