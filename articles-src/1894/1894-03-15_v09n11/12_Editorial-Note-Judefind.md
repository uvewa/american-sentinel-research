No one who reads the decision rendered in the Judefind case, published elsewhere, can fail to see its distinctively religious character. As to the specious plea made that in commanding the observance of Sunday "the legislature has not in any way interfered with their religious liberty, or with their worship of God in such manner as they think most acceptable to him," read the tract, published by the International Religious Liberty Association, entitled "Our Answer," and its fallacy will be made immediately apparent.

The decision of the Appellate Court of Illinois, in its final disposition of the Clingman World's Fair injunction suit, enjoining the Fair management from closing the gates on Sunday, is that Judge Stein's Court had no jurisdiction in the matter. Of this the Christian Reformer says:—

Christian citizens must be blind if they fail to see how this injunction case demonstrates the necessity of an authoritative and undeniable constitutional basis for Sabbath laws and all such distinctively Christian institutions of our Government. . . . Of all the practical arguments for the Christian amendment of our national Constitution, this Clingman injunction suit is the strongest that can be urged. . . . Let the attitude of the nation in all its courts and laws, toward the Sabbath and the Lord of the Sabbath, be so clearly defined by a constitutional acknowledgment that all such trickery will be hereafter impossible.

The arrogance of this demand for Church control over the State is suggestive of the manner in which it will be enforced when once the dignitaries of the Church militant feel sure of their seats on the bench of the religious court-martial.

The opinion of the court in the Judefind case, lately rendered in the Court of Appeals of Maryland, is reprinted on another page, from the Daily Record, of Baltimore. It is due to the counsel in this case, James T. Ringgold, Esq., to state that the appeal had been taken before he was called in to defend it, and the time had then passed for the issuance of a writ of certiorari, and the case was carried up by petition in the nature of a writ of error. This being so, it was Mr. Ringgold's contention that, the want of jurisdiction being apparent on the face of the proceedings, no special form of pleading was necessary to call attention to it. This decision is not a surprise, because of the previously known views of the chief justice who had already heard the cases of Baker, Bryan, Marvel, and others, of Maryland, in the lower court. There is an interesting point, however, in the definite holding, not previously made, that unless certain points of practice are followed, the question of validity of proceedings in the court below, though apparent on the face of the proceedings themselves, cannot be considered in the appellate court. Thus this decision makes it still more difficult for those who do not or can not employ counsel, and from the opening of their cases, to obtain the proper offices of the courts. It is interesting to note that in this decision as in that of Judge Hammond, in the King case, and that of Justice Brewer, of the United States Supreme Court, that "this is a Christian nation," the religious portion of the opinion is a dictum of the court, not necessarily involved in the technical decision itself.
