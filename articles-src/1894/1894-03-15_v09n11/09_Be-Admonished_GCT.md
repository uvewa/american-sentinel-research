Let no one deceive himself with the idea that we have outlived the time when men need to trouble themselves about the relation of the State to the Church; that men are no more to be called upon to suffer for conscience' sake. It is true that some centuries now intervene between us and the time when the Church of Rome allied to the power of the empire, sat supreme, drunken with the blood of martyrs, "and death and hell followed" the footsteps of its career. But let us not forget that human nature is in itself incapable of improvement, and that it is moved upon by the same malign spirit that has ever dogged the pathway of God's cause, to cast down and destroy his people and his truth. And even in our day these evil promptings are finding avenues for the exhibition of their real character, and they are seen to be the same that they were in the Dark Ages. Satan does not fully control human affairs, thank God, but he loses no chance to put in his malicious work to destroy the truth. In no way has he ever found a more satisfactory method of working his dreadful designs than when he could, by placing the civil power in the hands of one set of religionists, incite them to persecute, to slap their fellow-men—their fellow-servants even—those whom they ought to have loved with the same love with which Christ loved all men. And if Satan in these days could induce men to follow the same diabolical work, he would be no less pleased than he was in the days now gone by.

Does some one say that this cannot be? Let such beware, let them be admonished to look closely at the influences that are now molding society and moving the world. Let them watch carefully the trend of political and ecclesiastical events; let them take notice of the prestige that the Church is gaining in the political world, and the readiness with which statesmen listen to her counsels and heed her directions. It will not be difficult in all these things to see premonitions of coming danger. A vivid sense of this danger is our only safeguard. The situation need not be viewed with the eyes of an alarmist; it is a subject that requires sober thought and not hasty conclusions. It demands deliberate study, a close discernment, a fine discrimination between the true and the false, between logic and sophistry, between the genuine and the specious, for this question is not settled yet; and it never will be settled till it is settled right, and it never will be settled right till He comes whose right it is to reign, and the government is administered by Him who reigns in righteousness.

G. C. TENNEY.
