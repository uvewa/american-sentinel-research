[The Cottage Pulpit, of Nashville, Tennessee, makes this editorial mention of the cases of Messrs. McCutchen and Keck who are awaiting retrial in May, under the Georgia statute forbidding Sunday labor.]

We are sorry to learn that the two Seventh-day Adventists who were arrested and fined, and we believe imprisoned, in the town of Gainesville, Ga., some months ago for doing work on Sunday, after faithfully observing the Sabbath of the Bible, are still suffering under the ban of Georgia law for their devotion to the law of God, and likely to be yet more roughly handled for their "crime" by the higher courts under the Blue Law code of that "Christian commonwealth." It is lamentable to think that the moral sentiment of this enlightened age is not powerful enough to overawe such disgraceful proceedings, and have this and all similar clear-cut cases of religious persecution thrown out of court, as perversions of the laws themselves under which the pretended offenders were indicted, since it could never have been the intent of a "Christian legislature" to make criminals of Christians whose only offense is that they have literally followed the example of the Lord, who worked on the first day of the week and rested on the seventh—that they are in this Sabbath doctrine at least true to the Bible and their faith as a body of Christians! That be the work of Jesuitical Rome, and not of Protestant America!

Will our Georgia friends allow us to commend to their attention—and adoption of its patriotic sentiments and spirit if still worthy of the honor of being descended from an Oglethorpe and his revolutionary compatriots—the annexed extract from an old letter? The signature is familiar, and its genuineness is indisputable:—

"If I had the least idea of any difficulty resulting from the Constitution adopted by the convention of which I had the honor to be president when it was formed so as to endanger the rights of any religious denomination, then I never should have attached my name to that instrument. If I had any idea that the general Government was so administered that liberty of conscience was endangered, I pray you be assured that no man would be more willing than myself to revise and alter that part of it, so as to avoid all religious persecution. You can without doubt remember that I have often expressed my opinion, that every man who conducts himself as a good citizen is accountable alone to God for his religious faith, and should be protected in worshiping God according to the dictates of his conscience.—George Washington."

Be discouraged only when in your study of the Word of God, you can find where he has spoken a single word of discouragement to you.
