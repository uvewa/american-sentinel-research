In the trial of Messrs. McCutchen and Keck for Sunday work, in Gainesville, Ga., Mr. Keck said to the jury:—

GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY: I am happy to-day to stand here as a representative of my Saviour. It is not that you are trying me here to-day for what I have done; for the Lord, with whom I have become acquainted, has said, "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me." It is the Lord, the Saviour of mankind, who is on trial here. I thank him that he has said, "No man can serve two masters." One master, the Roman Catholic Church says, You keep Sunday, and you will show allegiance to me. The Lord says, Keep the seventh day as the Sabbath, and you will show allegiance to me. I bow in obedience to the Lord; and if he wishes me to suffer for exercising my right to work on the first day of the week, I am perfectly willing to do it.

In the course of his address to the jury the prosecuting attorney referred to this in these words:—

Mr. Keck says he is not on trial—that it is the Lord who is on trial. If that is so, gentlemen, I ask you to acquit the Lord right now. If we are prosecuting the Lord, I ask you to let him loose. But if this prosecution is against Keck and McCutchen and they violated the law, what will you have to say? that they shall not be convicted?—No! it is your duty to do it. They may think they represent the Lord, I don't say they do not, but I do say we cannot bother with the Lord by criminal indictment.

From these extracts it will be evident that in this case the actual issue was raised.
