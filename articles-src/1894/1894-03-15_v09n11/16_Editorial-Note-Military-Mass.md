The telegraphic news contains this item:—

Chicago, Ill.—The Seventh Infantry Regiment of the National Guard, which is composed of men of all denominations, has been ordered by the commanding officer to attend the service of St. Patrick's day at St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church in uniform and with side arms.

The service is to include the first military mass celebrated in the United States in many years. The order is strongly criticised by the Protestant members of the regiment.

The claim has been made that the Roman Catholics are in the majority in many of these military organizations. If this be true, and it be also true that the minority must bow to the rule of the majority in religious things, why then are these Protestant members objecting?
