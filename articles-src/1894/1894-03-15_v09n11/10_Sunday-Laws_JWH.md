THERE seems to be an idea in the minds of the people, or at least, some of the people, that enforcement of Sunday laws is not persecution any more than is the enforcement of the law against theft. The enforcement of the Sunday law carries with it the idea of a religious creed. All Sunday laws are the offspring of the union of Church and State; and wherever there has been a union of Church and State, there has been persecution more or less. Under such unions persons have been robbed of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And the more extensive and complete the union, the greater will be the loss of life, and liberty, and the greater will be the unjust restriction of the pursuit of happiness.

The law against Sunday work is based on the fourth commandment, and carries with it the idea that Sunday is the Sabbath of the Lord. The Lord, in speaking of the Sabbath, says, "In it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates." Here is a positive prohibition against work—against honest labor. And the reason assigned for this inhibition is, "For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it." The reason why Sunday law advocates have enacted laws prohibiting work on Sunday, and are laboring with all their might and main to enact more stringent ones, is because the fourth commandment says: "The Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it." It is impossible to exclude the idea of religion from a Sunday law. Sunday laws are the offspring of religion. Religion connects the idea of sacredness to the day, and the Sunday law connects the same idea with it. Religion does not forbid work on Sunday because the work in itself is wrong, but because the day is too sacred to devote to such a use: because the Lord has said thou shalt not work. The Sunday law does not forbid work on Sunday because the work in itself is wrong, or because it is a nuisance, or uncivil, or because it is a violation of any man's natural rights, civil or religious; but because of the idea of the sacredness of Sunday. The Sunday law regards the day as too sacred to be devoted to secular pursuits. From this we may fairly conclude that when a man is fined for Sunday work it is not for the work in itself, for that is done on every other day in the week; therefore it must be on account of the sacredness of the day on which it is done.

All religious denominations claim, and pretend to keep, some sacred day as a holy day. However, they do not all claim and pretend to keep the same day as a holy day. In this country the great majority claim, and pretend to keep, the first day of the week as a holy day. Now, if there never had been a person in all the past, down to the present, that ever challenged or doubted the sacredness of Sunday, and had all refrained from work, of a secular character, on that day, then there would not be a Sunday law on the statute books of any State on the face of the earth. From some cause somebody challenges or doubts Sunday as being the Sabbath of the fourth commandment, and, consequently, have seen fit, in their judgment, to regard some other day as a holy day. Right here we find the foundation for Sunday law. It is because somebody else believes that some other day is the Sabbath, or that somebody else does not believe that one day is more sacred than another, that we have Sunday laws in our country. It is just because of difference of opinion that Sunday laws have been enacted; and that difference of opinion is a religious difference. The Sunday law advocates do not concede that their fellow-citizens, who differ with them, have the right to believe or practice what they believe. To afflict, harass, or destroy, for adherence to a particular creed, or system of religious principles, or to a mode of worship, is persecution. To fine a man for Sunday work is just the same thing as to fine him for his belief or faith, for there is no other way for a man to show his faith but by his works. A man that believes Sunday is the Sabbath day, if consistent, will keep it as such. The only way he can show his respect for Sunday is by not doing on that day what he does on all other days of the week; and certainly this is a right none can justly be deprived of by human opinion or enactment. Just so with the man who believes that Saturday is the Sabbath. He has no other way to show his faith but by his works. And the only way he has to show his respect for Saturday as a Sabbath day is by not doing on that day what he does on all other days of the week. And certainly, this is a right none can be justly deprived of by human opinion or enactment. If any man be fined, imprisoned, harassed, or afflicted, because he worked on Sunday, it is, most certainly, religious persecution for conscience' sake: just, forsooth, because he differs from the majority; and further, if a man believes one day is just as sacred as another, the only way he has to show his faith is by his

works, viz., by doing the same things on every day of the week, and this is a right that none can be justly deprived of by any human opinion or enactment. So that, if a man be fined, imprisoned, harassed, or afflicted, because he works on every day of the week alike, it is, most certainly, religious persecution for conscience' sake: just, forsooth, because he differed from the majority. Then, most evidently, the enforcement of Sunday law is persecution. J. W. HANNER.
