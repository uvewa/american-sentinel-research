### General Note
This Mistral OCR transcription contained numerous spelling errors, particularly in proper names and archaic words. I have preserved the text as transcribed in the OCR output, making only corrections to obvious OCR errors where the intended word was clear from context. All substantive corrections are documented here.

## Confidence Level
MEDIUM - The OCR quality was reasonable but contained several clear errors that were corrected based on context and known usage patterns in the American Sentinel.
