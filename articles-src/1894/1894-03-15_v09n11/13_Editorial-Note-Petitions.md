Petitions are being presented to Congress which the Congressional Record describes as "in favor of an amendment to the Constitution recognizing the Deity," and "favoring an amendment to the preamble of the Constitution recognizing the kingship of Christ on the nations of the world, and the Bible as the basis of moral legislation." Very soon, probably, Congress will be flooded with this style of petition in greater quantities even than for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair. Is it not time for those, who thought and said that the demand for religious legislation was but an evanescent craze, to see their error and come out openly with the honest opposition which they have privately expressed?
