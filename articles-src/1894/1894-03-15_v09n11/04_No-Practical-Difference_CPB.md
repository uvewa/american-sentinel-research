In the account of the informal hearing on the so-called Christian amendment to the national Constitution, the Christian Reformer says:—

A free and easy and somewhat general conversation on certain aspects of the resolution occupied the time while waiting for one of the members of the committee, and prepared the way for a more formal presentation of the argument. The chief subject of this conversation was the difference between the Roman Catholic idea of the ultimate standard of right and wrong for a nation, and the idea of Protestant-denominations. It was brought out by different speakers that Romanism makes the pope the final authoritative interpreter of moral law for nations as well as for individuals. Nations must accept moral law as interpreted by the infallible pope as final. Protestants hold that the nation must interpret moral law in its own sphere of action for itself, taking help from advice and counsel from churches or other bodies or individuals that may address it by petitions or memorials or public meetings.

None are so blind as those who will not see. This seems to be the case of Dr. McAllister. It ought not to require any great amount of discernment to see that Rome is just as likely to advise as that Dr. McAllister will do so; and as Rome has in this country a much larger following than has the doctor, or any other "Protestant," and as that following is in shape to be wielded politically much more effectively than is even the small sect represented by Dr. McAllister, Rome has all the advantage. And she will use it too.

But as between the two is not the Roman Catholic idea the better one? If the moral law must be interpreted for the nation, surely the Church must do it for God has never committed instruction in morals to any other organization on earth. The true Protestant idea is the right of private judgment. This the McAllister idea denies as surely as does the Roman Catholic idea. Moreover, the National Reform idea makes moral questions a football for contending parties. That which is moral to-day under a Democratic administration might be immoral to-morrow under Republican rule, and vice versa. The fact is that governments as such have nothing to do with the divine law as such. Each individual not only in the government but in the nation is individually responsible to God and under the jurisdiction of the divine law; and just in proportion as this responsibility is recognized and this obligation respected will men be honest and administer the affairs of government honestly. But when the government as such interprets the divine law it interprets it not only for the individuals, who as the government make that interpretation, but for all others in the nation as well, and the power of the government is exercised to force upon the people that interpretation, which at best is not divine law, but only that which some man or set of men think is in the divine law.

An illustration of this is furnished by the Sunday laws of our States. The divine law says: "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work." Most of the States have interpreted this law to mean Sunday, and the prohibition against work they have interpreted to mean except works of necessity and charity, etc., including often the running of railroad trains, the operating of ferries, the selling of meat, etc. Would it not be much better to leave the whole matter of interpreting not only this divine law of the Sabbath, but of every other divine law, to the individual? and the government give its undivided attention to defining and protecting inherent natural rights? In short would it not be better for government to confine itself to the sphere described in the Declaration of Independence, namely: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed." The interpreting of moral law was not, in the opinion of the founders of our Government, any part of the duty of civil government; and in this opinion they were clearly right. The right of private judgment may be invaded by the National Reform régime, as it has been already, but that right being God-given cannot cease to be, and some men will continue to exercise it even if it costs them life itself.

"Nothing," says Dr. McAllister, "could so effectually guard against all uniting of Church and State and all dictatorial interference of ecclesiastical powers with the conduct of national life than this principle which it is proposed to acknowledge here. Let the nation itself recognize its own obligations in its proper sphere of law and rights, as distinct from that of the Church, to take the law of God as the rule of its conduct, and then let it interpret and apply that law for itself, and there will be embodied in our fundamental law the most effectual barrier possible against all intermingling and confounding of the relations and functions and duties of Church and State."

That is to say, let the State voluntarily give its power into the hands of the Church, or of a combination of churches, and accept as its rule of action the moral law as interpreted by them, and there can be no possible conflict! Certainly not. There is never any conflict between the obedient slave and his master. The doctor proposes to prevent "all intermingling and confounding of the relations and functions and duties of Church and State," by making it perfectly clear that it is the function and duty of the State to be the obedient slave of the Church. A fine scheme truly!
