The Ancient Order of Hibernians, and other Irish Catholic societies of Brooklyn, have asked the mayor of that city to hoist the green flag over the Brooklyn City Hall on St. Patrick's day. A considerable delegation interviewed the mayor on the subject, and this is part of the New York Sun's report of what was said:—

Miles F. McPartland then followed in a brief argument, much after the style of Mr. O'Donnell. Mayor Schieren cut him off by asking what he should do if some person came and asked him to put up a flag in celebration of Martin Luther. Mr. O'Donnell replied that such a celebration would smack of religion.

"Wasn't St. Patrick a religious man?" demanded the mayor.

Mr. O'Donnell.—St. Patrick was not only a religious man, but he broke the chains of paganism and slavery.

Mayor Schieren.—What has this country to do with this question, anyhow? I have not made up my mind, but I will give no preference to anybody.

Just as one delegate reached the door, he turned back, and, looking straight at the mayor, said:

"Mr. Hewitt did the same thing once in New York."

"Mr. Hewitt has nothing to do with me," was the mayor's parting shot.

Such straws as this have a very apt suggestiveness when it is remembered that the next time Mr. Hewitt ran for mayor of New York, after his collision with the Catholic societies, he was defeated.
