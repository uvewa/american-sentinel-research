---

IN 1829 there was a united effort on the part of a number of religious denominations in the United States to secure from the national Government a Sunday law. Many petitions and memorials were sent to Congress. The committee to whom the matter was referred in the Senate, rendered a very able report, in which occur these words:—

Extensive religious combinations to effect a political object are, in the opinion of the committee, always dangerous. All religious despotism has commenced by combination and influence; and when that influence begins to operate on the political institutions of a country, the civil power soon bends under it; and the catastrophe of other nations furnishes us an awful warning of the consequence.

From what must be apparent to every one, it is evident that the danger here pointed out is an actual one in the Australasian colonies,—extensive religious combination to effect a political object. The "Council of the Churches," the "Christian Electors' Association," the "Lord's day Observance Society," and the "National Scripture Education League" are witnesses to this fact. Matters here have started on the road to religious despotism. We wait to see how long before the civil power bends under these religious combinations and this influence. But we expect to work while we wait, and do all in our power to warn every one of the danger herein involved, and to rouse the people to a sense of the value of the privilege of religious liberty heretofore enjoyed.
