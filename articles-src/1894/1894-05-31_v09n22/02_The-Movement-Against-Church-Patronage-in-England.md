It is well known that the right of presentation to livings in the Church of England belongs, in a multitude of cases, to lay patrons, and that this fact has repeatedly given rise to grave scandals. Not only have avowed atheists and notorious blacklegs—the late Marquis of Ailesbury was an example—exercised the power of bestowing, as free gifts, life appointments to rectorships, but such appointments have been made the subject of sale at public auction.

The necessity of checking these glaring abuses has long been recognized, and it has been emphasized by the recent introduction of a bill to disestablish the Anglican Church in Wales. A palliative measure, which has the approval of the bishops and the clergy, is now pending before Parliament, and although it has been criticised by Sir William Harcourt and by representatives of Nonconformism on the ground that it does not go far enough, it seems likely to become a law. The proposal in question has three main features. First, it prohibits the sale of the next presentation to a living, thus providing that the advowson or perpetual right of presentation to a living, whenever a vacancy occurs, shall hereafter be exercised only by way of gift. Secondly, although the advowson itself may be sold, there must be a complete transfer of the right, and no mortgage or encumbrance of any kind must be imposed on the advowson or the living. Finally, the bill enumerates six reasons for which a bishop can refuse to institute a clergyman to a living. These are, that the clergyman has not been ordained one year; that he is unfit through physical or mental infirmity; that he is in great pecuniary difficulties; that he has been guilty of misconduct or neglect of duty in the offices which he has previously filled, or that there is a grave scandal or evil report affecting his moral conduct. A right of appeal, however, is given to the patron and presenter from the bishop's decision to the archbishop.

In the debate on the second reading of this bill a Nonconformist denounced it as a half-hearted measure, and declared that the evil complained of could be abolished only by prohibiting the sale of advowson altogether. Sir William Harcourt called the bill a sham, because it left untouched the persons who dispense most of the spiritual offices. It forbade a poor man, who happened to own an advowson, to sell the next presentation; but it did not prevent a peer, or other rich person, from distributing livings as free gifts, and thus forming a sort of spiritual oasis by taking care that all the rectors in his neighborhood should be in agreement with himself. Sir William agreed with the Dissenters in thinking that neither lay patrons nor the bishops ought to have the whole power of appointment to clerical office. A bill, to be thorough-going, ought to give the parishioners some such power of effective control over the choice of their clergyman as is in force in Scotland. It was pointed out that the recent growth of the Church of England had taken place for the most part in the large towns, where it was practically a voluntary church, the clergyman depending to a large extent on the approval of his congregation. Another speaker hit the mark exactly when he said that the scandals associated with lay patronage would be entirely shaken off when the Church of England's connection with the State should be dissolved.

Meanwhile, there seemed to be a general feeling that half a loaf was better than no bread at all; and so the bill passed the second reading, and will doubtless be carried through its subsequent stages.—N. Y. Sun.
