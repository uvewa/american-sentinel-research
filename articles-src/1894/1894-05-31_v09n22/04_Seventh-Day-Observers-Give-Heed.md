[Under the title, "Seventh-day Baptists, Give Heed," Rev. A. H. Lewis contributes the following article to the Sabbath Recorder. While Dr. Lewis does not realize that the "Collapse of recent efforts to save Sunday by civil law" is only apparent, and that in reality all the legislative and judicial functions of the country have been immediately committed to its support, yet the logical development of the argument for the support of first-day observance is just what he has pointed out,—necessarily ending in the doing away with the authority of the Scriptures and making the Bible only a book of general principles, necessarily ending in a papacy as its infallible interpreter.]

I desire to call the attention of your readers, and especially of all Seventh-day Baptist ministers, to a new phase of the Sabbath controversy which has been pushed to the front within two years past. It is the third phase which has appeared within the memory of your readers who are forty years old. The original Puritan theory of the "change of the day" was still prominent in the most orthodox and religious circles twenty-five years ago. When the more exhaustive treatment of that phase was entered upon by Seventh-day Baptists and others it soon yielded, and the "no Sabbath," "any day," "seventh part of time," theory was rushed to the front. This is still presented in various ways because it seems to afford the nearest retreat when men are pressed by the demands of the Sabbath. But the leaders of thought see that the escape is not complete until the Bible is silenced as a book of definite and specific authority. Hence, in military phrase, they are building a new position for their "long-range guns." It is this:—

The Bible is only a book of general principles, and not an authoritative source of specific rules. These general principles may be applied according to individual choice and to fit changing circumstances.

This is the most favorable form of statement. It is not made by non-Christian opponents of Sunday, but by Christian leaders who oppose the Sabbath. They say: "You Seventh-day Baptists are right, so far as the Bible is concerned, but the latest investigations and the 'Higher Criticism' show that God never intended the Bible to be accepted as to specific rules." Of course this theory sweeps away the Sabbath, baptism in any form, the Lord's Supper, and in the end the organized church; and many announce themselves ready to accept such an issue. This new theory, or perhaps I should say tendency, is a compound of Quakerism, no-lawism and Roman Catholicism; the amount of each element varying according to circumstances. There is enough truth in the mixture to make it more attractive, and, considering the present state of the public mind, more dangerous than any phase of the Sabbath question which has arisen within the last three hundred years. It is also equally dangerous to Christianity as represented in history. It is another form of the lawlessness which compelled men to the Protestant movement.

No form of organized Christianity is so directly affected by this issue as that represented by the readers of the Recorder, and by other Sabbath-keeping Christians. Baptists come next in order; while the Roman Catholic fold is created and conducted so as to welcome the flood-tide which will come under the supremacy of such a theory. It has always said: "The Bible is authoritative only as interpreted by the Church."

Three prominent factors have united to develop this new position on the part of the enemies of the Sabbath.

(a) The strength, persistency and thoroughness with which the defenders of the Sabbath have marshalled the facts of history in support of the Seventh-day Baptist position.

(b) The better knowledge of what the Bible actually teaches. The most earnest and intelligent students of the Bible have learned that Sunday observance has no place in that book. Many of them openly acknowledge this. Others continue to assume that it does, while they are seeking new forms of retreat from the facts which they know, but do not openly avow.

(c) The collapse of recent efforts to save Sunday by civil law. The various failures connected with Sunday law movements at Washington and elsewhere, and the success of "Sunday opening" at the World's Fair, have greatly disheartened the advocates of more stringent laws by which to save the "Imperiled American Sabbath," although they keep up a desultory firing and make much of the slightest regard for Sunday law which appears anywhere, their tendency to retreat cannot be covered.

(d) By no means the least of these factors is the growth of the Roman Catholic doctrine among Protestants, that the authority of custom, based on the decrees of the Church, supersedes the "letter of the Bible." This is most significant, since it evinces the fundamental agreement of popular Protestantism with its ancient enemy.

The most casual observer must see that this new issue touching the Sabbath involves that new era, which must come in Protestant history, unless the Protestant movement has already seen its brightest and strongest days. It must not be forgotten that Protestantism has not yet reached a final and successful issue. The vigor of its earlier history has not been wholly retained. The fundamental principles on which it was based, have a wider development and a grander future, or ignominious defeat.

It is here that Seventh-day Baptists must be awakened to the fact that, as in the early times of their existence, and of Protestantism, so now their position involves the fundamental elements of that movement. Their past history and present struggles are a foolish whim if nothing more than mere "denominationalism" is involved. The greatest danger that threatens the cause which God has entrusted to the readers of the Recorder is indifference to the greatness of present issues, and a shrinking from the labor and anxiety which are necessary in order to understand and meet them. If their birthright and their work is not measurelessly larger than the "day of the Sabbath," as ordinarily understood, it is not worth even a "mess of pottage." If it is what I have indicated above, it involves even more than the early stages of Protestant dissent did. Sleepy-eyed men with narrow vision are of no value in such a struggle.
