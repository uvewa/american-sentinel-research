THE young men that live on the south side make a general practice of playing games of baseball on the Sabbath day.

It is really a sin, for these young men; and even small children, some not ten years of age, are engaged in such games. Such practice should be abandoned, and the attention of the officers is called to the same. The children that should come to the Sabbath-schools are hindered by these worldly affairs. The Bible tells us to "honor the Sabbath day to keep it holy." —Clergyman, in Daily Republican, Wilmington, Del.
