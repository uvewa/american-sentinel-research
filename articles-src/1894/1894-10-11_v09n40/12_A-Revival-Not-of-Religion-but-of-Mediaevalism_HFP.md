We are upon the eve of a great revival. But it is not a revival of religion! It is a revival of the satanic spirit of mediaevalism! It is not altogether in barbaric nations that we see evidences of it, but in so-called Christian governments as well. In Russia the "Imperial Holy Church" has decreed that Stundists and Baptists must be re-baptized into the Greek Church at once. In case of refusal their children are taken from them and placed in convents or in Greek Catholic families; their goods confiscated and they banished to Siberia. All of which, and more, these Christians are called upon to suffer for conscience' sake. Their churches are burned, their cattle killed, and they are inhumanly beaten by the officers and insulted by the mob. This in the name of religion!

In the dominions of the queen, in Australia, Seventh-day Adventists are under the ban of an old Sunday law, a law enacted under Charles II., in 1649; of whom Macaulay said that he "was indolent, unambitious, depraved, and a secret Catholic." But as antiquated as it is, and hoary with age, and notwithstanding the unsavory reputation of religious laws of that remote period, it answers the purpose of superstition, prejudice, bigotry, and intolerance; and causes the arrest of Christian men—two brothers,—who, without being allowed to plead their God-given rights as a reason for their conduct (they worked on their fruit farm on Sunday), the magistrate peremptorily required to plead, "Guilty or not guilty:" and when they acknowledged that they had worked on Sunday, the sentence was at once announced; being a fine of five shillings, or two hours' confinement in the public stocks! This also in the name of religion! Now where is the difference between the persecution of Baptists and Stundists in Russia, and of these Adventists in Australia? The only difference is in the severity, and not in the spirit that actuates it.

Come to our own boasted land of light and liberty, and what do we find? We find a continued demand for more stringent Sunday laws, State and national, by which offenders may be punished. Not only so, but Sunday leagues are multiplied which, according to their own showing, are for the purpose of compelling men, by the power of the civil law, to serve God. And this is not all. Note the continued arrests for violation of Sunday laws in various parts of the country. Nor is this all. No one can close his eyes to the continued persecutions of Seventh-day Adventists in Maryland, Georgia, and Tennessee. Denied their rights as citizens, confined in damp and dismal jails, dragged from court to court, compelled to work alongside of common criminals in the chain-gang, ordered by the courts to educate their consciences according to the laws of the State; some of these men hounded to the very death: and all this in the name of religion! And in this "Christian" nation!

Now I ask: Where is the difference between the three? The only difference is in the degree of severity. It certainly cannot be in the spirit that actuates these persecutors, whether in Russia, Australia, or in this "land of liberty." When will Christians cease persecuting Christians? But have they not already done so? Indeed: have Christians ever persecuted? Men who professed to be Christians have persecuted. Men of the same stamp are now persecuting. But to be a Christian is to be Christ-like, and Christ never persecuted. Therefore it is true, that no Christian ever was or ever can be guilty of persecution. And, therefore, we conclude that all who ever persecuted, or who may now be engaged in that diabolical work, are not Christians, even though they profess to be Christians, but are antichristian, and are actuated by the spirit of antichrist. — H. F. Phelps, in Protestant American, Aug. 1, 1894.
