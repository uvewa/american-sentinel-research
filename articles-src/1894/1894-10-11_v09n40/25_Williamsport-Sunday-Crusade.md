WILLIAMSPORT, Pa., has organized a branch of the State Sunday Observance Association. The call under which the meeting for organization was effected, declares:—

Our city is in open rebellion against the divine laws. Our people are being corrupted with vile and debasing literature—also in other ways. The blessed Sabbath is being openly and shamefully violated and trampled upon by individuals and corporations. In view of these facts the time has come for our Christian and moral men to call a halt regarding this state of things, and change Williamsport into a model city. We therefore call upon all lovers of the right and of law and refer to be present, etc., to devise ways and means to change the present condition of things in our city.

Of the proposed work of the association, the Williamsport Gazette and Bulletin says:—

The sale of newspapers on Sunday will be attacked and the vendors will be promptly arrested and prosecuted. The strong arm of the law will be invoked to jerk the trolley wheel from the wire, and the man who wants to ride may, possibly, have to walk. In fact, it is to be a crusade against Sunday traffic of all kinds, and a red hot, lively time is anticipated.

It is yet too soon to report results from this organization, but as there are Seventh-day Adventists in Williamsport, and as they have been by the Christian Statesman declared to be the worst enemies of "the Sabbath" we may expect them to be among the first victims of the Sunday crusade.
