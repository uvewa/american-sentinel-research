NEW YORK, Sept. 13.—Rev. Father Ducy, in a letter to the New York World, reviews the work done by the Senate Investigating Committee in this city. He declares that he was delegated by the Vatican to carefully watch the proceedings of the committee and make a report to Rome. He continues: "It is very unfortunate that people have been unkind enough to couple Tammany corruption with the Catholic name, and it is very fortunate for our good name that the Catholics as well as the non-Catholics of New York can have the assurance that Leo XIII. and those close to him at the Vatican are vigilant watchers in the watch-tower; are sacredly guarding the good name of the Catholics in this great city of the Republic. I am informed that the communications that have reached the Vatican in relation to Tammany have produced a deep impression; so deep, in fact, that I have been instructed to put certain information in form and forward it immediately to Rome. I am delighted at the interest for a moral purification taken by the head of the church, and I trust that my non-Catholic brethren will be kind enough to stop impugning the fair name of our church and not hold it responsible for the corruption in its midst. The priesthood is deeply interested in all that concerns the welfare and purity of this city, and in its ranks there are men who have sacrificed themselves in many ways to add to the fair name of New York and of the whole country. In conclusion I should say that I am instructed by telegraph how to act in these matters of so much public importance."—Inter Ocean, Chicago, Sept. 14.
