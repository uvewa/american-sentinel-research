PITTSBURG, Pa., Oct. 1.—At its meeting in the Crafton Church tomorrow, the Pittsburg Presbytery will consider the greatest scheme ever brought before it for a federal union of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, the United Presbyterian Church, the Associate Reformed Synod of the South, the German Reformed Church, the General Synod of the Dutch Reformed Church, and the Presbyterian Church.

Rev. Dr. James M. Maxwell, of Monongabela City, will present an elaborate report on the subject. The plan of federation, as sent down to the lower judicatories by the highest church courts in America, is a federal union of the above-named denominations, to promote coöperation in their home and foreign missionary work, to keep watch on current religious, moral, and social movements, and take such action as may concentrate the influence of all the churches in the maintenance of the truth that our nation is a Protestant Christian nation, and of all that is therein involved. It is an effort to consolidate forces, organize more effectually, and centralize the dissenting forces, in order to move in union and rapidly on a given command.—Washington Post, Oct. 2.
