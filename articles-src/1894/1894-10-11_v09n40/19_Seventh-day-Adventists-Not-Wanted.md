THAT the new law and order movement, which was launched last night at the Second United Presbyterian Church, under the significant name of the Allegheny County Vigilance League, will be ruled according to dogmatic principles, was demonstrated by an incident that happened at its initial meeting. It was brought about through the probable ignorance or mistake of those who sent out notices of the meeting, but it none the less shows that none except those who follow the dictates of the leader will be allowed any say in the management of the league.

Invitations had been sent to all the churches in the two cities, inviting each to send representatives to the meeting. Among the others the congregation of the Seventh-day Adventists received its notice and selected Thomas D. Gibson, William Zeidler and John Williamson as a committee to attend the meeting in a representative capacity. When the discussion of the objects of the new purifier of public morals had proceeded for some time the representatives of the Seventh-day Adventists found that the views of those at the head of the movement did not exactly coincide with those of their church. Mr. Williamson took the floor to express his views on the subject of Sunday observance, holding that no one or no organization had a right to enforce the observance of any one day as Sunday. The chair recognized him, and according to Mr. Williamson's idea of the meeting, he had a right to express his views, as he was there as a delegate, and the discussion was understood to be open to all.

It did not turn out this way, however; as the speaker had said only enough to let it be understood that he had opinions of his own on this subject, and that these opinions did not agree with those of the men at the head of the meeting; Rev. J. T. McCrory raised the question that the speaker was out of order and had him shut off.

The incident caused a flutter of excitement in the meeting, but notwithstanding the injustice done the speaker, there was no recourse to the ruling, as the sentiment among the majority of those present was evidently against him. The proceedings of the meeting went on without further interruption. One of the delegates said he supposed the secretary had made a mistake in sending the notice to Seventh-day Adventists, forgetting that they were Christians every day of the week, while others were such only one day out of the seven.—Pittsburg (Pa.) Press, Sept. 26.
