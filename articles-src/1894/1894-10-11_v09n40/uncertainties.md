## OCR Corrections Made

### Page 1, Line 19
- **Original OCR:** "A. F. BALLINGER"
- **Corrected to:** "A. F. BALLENGER"
- **Reason:** Known editor name; OCR misread final letters

### Page 3, Line 176
- **Original OCR:** "¹ The Reporter, Washington, Pa., Sept. 24, 1891."
- **Noted:** This date appears to be 1820 based on context (the article discusses events from 1820), but OCR shows 1891. Left as OCR shows since this is a footnote reference in the 1894 Sentinel.

### Page 5, Line 272
- **Original OCR:** "H. P. HOLSER"
- **Noted:** This appears correct; author is the manager of Basel publishing house

### Various locations
- **OCR artifacts corrected:** Obvious spacing errors, line breaks within words corrected throughout
- **Preserved:** All original spelling including archaic forms (e.g., "to-day")
- **Preserved:** All original punctuation and capitalization

## Notes

All corrections made were for obvious OCR errors only. Original 1894 text preserved exactly, including spelling, punctuation, and capitalization patterns of the period.
