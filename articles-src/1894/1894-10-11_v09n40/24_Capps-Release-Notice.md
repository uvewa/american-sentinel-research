A ROMAN CATHOLIC and an Episcopalian have been arrested at Kent Narrows, Queen Anne's Co., Md., for fishing on Sunday, and fined five dollars and costs each. They have appealed to the circuit court, and the cases will be tried early in November, at Centreville. As there will be no religious prejudice in these cases, it will be interesting to note the outcome of them. It is stated that a desire for fees on the part of the constable led to the arrests.

W. B. Capps, the most recent victim of religious intolerance in Tennessee, writes us as follows:—

Dresden, Tenn., Oct. 1, 1894.

PUBLISHERS AMERICAN SENTINEL: You will please change my paper to Trezevant, Carroll Co., Tenn., I am released to-day. The American Hebrew, of New York, finished paying the costs in my case, $94.87. I will have for home to-day after being held ninety-seven days by the wicked Sunday law.

Yours truly,

W. B. CAPPS.

On receipt of this letter we called upon the American Hebrew and secured some interesting facts regarding the case of Mr. Capps, which will appear in our next issue.
