FROSTBURG, Md., Sept. 30.—Cardinal Gibbons preached on "Labor" to a large congregation in St. Michael's Church today. In his sermon he said:—

"In our times there is a great tendency in every department of business throughout the United States, as well as Great Britain, to form companies. There is a continuous network of companies and partnerships. When corporations combine it is quite natural for the laboring men to follow their example.

"But labor societies have many dangers menacing them. They are composed of men formidable in numbers, varying in character and nationality. They are naturally more difficult to manage and more liable to be dissolved than companies or corporations. They are in need of leaders of tact and ability who will aid the employees of the societies without infringing upon their employers.

"One of the most difficult questions in our times to discuss is the question of strikes. Perhaps this is not an unfavorable time to allude to this subject, as the great strike is ended and men are disposed to be more dispassionate in their judgments than they were some months ago. Strikes, as experience has demonstrated, are very questionable for the redress of the laborer's grievances. They check industry, excite passion. They often lead to the destruction of property, and they result in inflicting many injuries by keeping the laborer in idleness, while his mind is clouded by discontent, and his family not unfrequently suffer for the comforts and necessities of life.

"From statistics furnished by Carrol D. Wright, of the eight years ending December 31, 1888, we find that the loss to the employees by strikes amounted to nearly $73,000,000, while the employers lost only one-half this amount. I earnestly hope that some efficient remedy will be found to put an end to our recurring strikes, and arbitration seems to be the most potent method that can be conceived of. A method that entails misery and loss is not the best means of adjusting labor grievances. A plan that will carry with it good and true Christian civilization should be sought for and adopted."—N. Y. Sun, Oct. 1.
