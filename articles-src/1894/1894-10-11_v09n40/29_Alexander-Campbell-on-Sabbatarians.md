COMMENCING this week the SENTINEL will publish a number of articles composed of quotations from the pen of Alexander Campbell against Sunday laws. Let the readers of the SENTINEL make a special effort to get these numbers into the hands of members of the Christian or Disciple Church.

Special attention is called to the position taken by Mr. Campbell that seventh-day observers cannot obey Sunday laws, and that to attempt to compel them to obey the Sunday institution in which they have no faith is to attempt to compel them to sin, and again that Sabbatarians may be conscientious in laboring on Sunday,—may "conscientiously drive their wagon on the Sabbath of the majority."
