THE RUSSIAN CORRESPONDENT OF THE NEW YORK OBSERVER says, in a recent letter to that paper: "One of the most remarkable phenomena connected with the religious life of Russia, is the perpetual sprouting forth of new and strange sects from the parent stem of the Orthodox Greek faith. This is all the more remarkable in a country where dead uniformity is so insisted on, and where deviations from the established order of things is visited with such condign penalties." It is only a natural revolt against the tyranny of the Greek Church. And what wonder if the sheep in their efforts to escape the wolves in sheep's clothing, become scattered.
