THE JEWISH TIMES AND OBSERVER has this to say about the persecution of Jews in Russia:—

Hypocritical Russia occasionally announces to the world by some hired agent that the Jews are not told to leave that country. Before the world, Russia clasps the emblem which is held by the world to be the token of love, justice, mercy and charity, and calls herself, and gets herself called, holy. In the recesses of the empire, she manages to perform acts, diabolical in themselves, and rendered all the more so by the ingenuity she exercises to make them appear what Mr. Gladstone once called "domestic and internal arrangements" merely. To her Jews, her policy is summed up just in this: When she does not tell them to go, she makes it so uncomfortable for them, that they cannot stay.

The treatment of Sabbath-keepers in some of our American States is not essentially different; laws are made and enforced that they cannot conscientiously obey, and they are cooly told that if they don't like it they can leave the country. Bigotry and intolerance are about the same everywhere.
