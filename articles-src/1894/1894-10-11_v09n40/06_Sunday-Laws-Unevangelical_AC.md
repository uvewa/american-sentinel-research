"The whole of the precepts or commands of the Christian religion are contained in the New Testament.

"But there is no precept or command in the New Testament to compel, by civil law, any man who is not a Christian, to pay any regard to the Lord's day more than any other.

"Therefore, to compel a man who is not a Christian to pay any regard to the Lord's day more than any other day is without authority in the Christian religion."

"The gospel commands no duty that can be performed without faith in the Son of God. 'Whatsoever is not of faith is sin.'

"But to command men destitute of faith, to observe any Christian institution, such as the Lord's day, is commanding duty to be performed without faith in the Son of God.

"Therefore, to compel unbelievers, or natural men, to observe, in any sense, the Lord's day, is anti-evangelical, or contrary to the gospel."¹
