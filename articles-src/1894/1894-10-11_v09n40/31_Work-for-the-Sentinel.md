A MINISTER in Canada writes thus concerning the SENTINEL:—

I have just finished reading the SENTINEL of Sept. 20th, and had a great feast, but it only makes me long for another. The SENTINEL is worth a thousand times its weight in gold, and is growing better all the time. God bless the SENTINEL!

A statesman of Tennessee writes of a recent issue:—

The whole paper is richly laden with the good things of truth and wisdom. I only say, by way of manifesting my indorsement, Go on in the good work as you have been going and surely you will be rewarded with a triumphant and joyous victory of truth over error and of the freedom of conscience over the shameful persecutions that have of late blackened the fair name of my own Tennessee, and other States.

Will not all lovers of liberty earnestly endeavor to increase the circulation of the SENTINEL? Why not call our neighbors to this weekly feast "of good things"? The SENTINEL ought to have a million readers, and this it could have if every appreciative reader of the paper would make an earnest effort to increase its circulation.
