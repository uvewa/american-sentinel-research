WHEREVER the persecuting "patriotic" orders get into power, they dismiss all Catholic teachers from our public schools. They have done this in Kansas City, Kans., for instance, and now the priests of that place have petitioned their bishop to let them send all the parochial school children there to the public schools, so that the board of education, which is controlled by the A. P. A., may have the expense of providing for their education. If this were done everywhere, the tax-payers would groan, for we save them millions on millions of dollars every year by providing out of our pockets for the schooling of our own children, after paying our full portion of the taxes for the support of our public schools. If our children were all sent to the public schools, we would raise an agitation from one end of the country to the other, to make the public schools thoroughly "unsectarian," instead of largely Protestant as they are at present. The short-sighted "patriots" would save themselves money and trouble by letting us alone. We suffer enough already. We are not here by their toleration or permission. We are in our fathers' house—here by right of discovery, by right of first settlement, by right of inheritance, by right of faithful service to the Republic, by right of possession, by right of law. We ask no favors of them.—Catholic Review, Sept. 1.
