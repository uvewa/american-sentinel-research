"I now proceed to show that these combinations, and the laws under which they act, are unconstitutional in our good and free State of Pennsylvania. That this proposition may be fully established and illustrated, I shall refer you to the supreme law of Pennsylvania. The text to which I allude is the third and twenty-sixth sections of the ninth article of the constitution of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which is indeed the spirit of the Constitution of the United States. The preamble to the ninth article reads thus:—

That the general, great, and essential principles of liberty and free government may be recognized and unalterably established. . . . We declare (Section Third) that all men have a natural and undefensible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences; and no man can of right be compelled to attend, erect, or support, any place of worship, or to maintain any ministry against his consent; that no human authority can in any case whatever control or interfere with the rights of consciences and that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishments or modes of worship.

SECTION 26. To guard against transgressions of the high powers which we have delegated, we declare that everything in this article is expected not of the general powers of government, and shall forever remain inviolate.

"Let this most salutiferous doctrine be applied to the combinations alluded to, and for the sake of illustration, to one of the subjects of their persecution, viz.: Sabbath-breakers. A Sabbath-breaker in the eyes of this association, and in the eyes of the anti-constitutional law under which, they say, they act, is, a man who does not pay a certain degree of religious respect to the day called the Sabbath.

"In the first place, then, let it be observed that the observance of any day in a religious manner is exclusively a right of conscience; and as such the non-observance of it can not be constitutionally censured and punished by civil law in any shape or form whatsoever. Conscientious regard to any practice in religion is the only regard commendable in the sight of Him to whom religious homage is due. To regard any day in a religious point of view, in any other, than in a conscientious manner, is not to regard it. This being incontrovertibly evident, it is obvious that any compulsory observance is non-observance, and to control a man in that which is undeniably the right of conscience only, is to destroy liberty of conscience and to violate the only guarantee and charter of our freedom and liberty,—the Constitution of our country.

"The encroachments that have usually been made upon the liberties of any people were, in the first instance, trifling and at long intervals. The specious pretext under which they have been attempted were the interests of religion or the public good. In so far this infringement of the excellent constitution of Pennsylvania has been analogous to the first inroads made upon the liberties of those once renowned nations that are now slaves of kings and priests.
