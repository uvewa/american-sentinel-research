CONSIDERABLE complaint has been made by the people living on Tattnall Street between Twenty-second and Twenty-third Streets about a man living in that square, who works the greater part of each Sunday making rowboats. Something should be done to break up the nuisance, and to learn the man that Sunday is a day of rest.—Daily Republican, Wilmington, Del.
