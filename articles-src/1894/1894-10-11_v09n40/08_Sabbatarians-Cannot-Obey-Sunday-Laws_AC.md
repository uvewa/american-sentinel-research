"Again, let it be remembered that there are many valuable citizens who are entitled to all the privileges of citizens, who cannot conscientiously regard the first day of the week, or Lord's day, as the Sabbath of the Jews. The Jews themselves cannot. There are some of them now in Pennsylvania, and the prospect of more. The Jews sanctify our Saturday, their own Sabbath, and cannot conscientiously observe the first day as the seventh. The Seventh-day Baptists, or Sabbatarians, of whom there are a good many in the United States, observe the seventh, but cannot conscientiously regard the first called the Christian Sabbath, as some people think they ought.
