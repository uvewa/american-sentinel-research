IN CONCLUDING a letter to the German Roman Catholic Central Verein, in this city, September 17, Mgr. Satolli said:—

Please also to accept my best wishes for your next congress, and be sure that, although I cannot take part in it personally, my heart will be among you, by imploring from heaven the choicest blessings upon all of you in my name, and in the name of the Holy Father himself. Yours truly in X.,

FRANCIS ARCHER. SATOLLI,
Delegate Apostolic.

The disciples were instructed to ask of the Father in the name of Jesus, and were assured that they should receive; and Christians from that day to this have asked in that all-prevailing name; but the "Delegate Apostolic" asks in his own name and in "the name of the Holy Father." And it is to such a religion as this—a religion that gives to men the honor due to Christ—that the pope invites the "rulers and peoples of the universe!"
