A CERTAIN Rev. Mr. Weaver opened the Republican Convention in Iowa with prayer, which was received with thunders of applause. The gem of the invocation was a request "that the Lord would hasten the day when the infamous Democratic party should be exterminated from the earth [cheers]; that it should never be heard of again forever. [Loud cheers.] It had never accomplished anything but disaster for the country. [Applause.] Yet, I implore divine grace to remember it for any good it has done that escaped my attention." [Loud amens.] The Christian charity of this last clause must be remembered when the pious good taste of the previous parts are considered. A display like this would seem to indicate that it is near time to eliminate the religious exercises from the programme upon similar occasions.—Evening Sun.
