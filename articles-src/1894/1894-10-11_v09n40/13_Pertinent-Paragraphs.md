Some of the propositions put forward by prominent advocates of religious equality, are the following:—

"Religion is none of the concerns of government."

"The duty of the civil magistrate to religion is to let it alone."

"The province of the civil ruler about religion is to have no province at all."

"No privilege or advantage shall be conceded to Christianity or any other special religion."

"Civil legislation ought not to extend beyond the outward and secular affairs of communities."

"The entire political system shall be founded and administered on a purely secular basis."

"The civil ruler is forbidden by Him who is 'Lord of the conscience' to exercise his official power in any way that involves any recognition and assistance of the Church."

"The system of Establishment 'invades the divine prerogative,' and violates the rights of conscience."

"Religious freedom consists in giving 'Heaven's truth a fair field against the devil's lie.'"

"To own the magistrate's right to employ the national resources for the support of any section of the Church, is to place Caesar on the throne of Christ."

"It is not within the province of the State to provide religious instruction for the subject."

"The most perfect religious equality can alone meet their just demands."

"Government is like a banking institution or a railroad corporation, which has nothing to do with the religion of the shareholders."

"The best legislation on the subject of religion is to repeal all previous legislation on the subject." — Compiled by Rev. Jas. Kerr, Glasgow, Scotland.
