IN COMMENTING ON THE CASE OF W. B. CAPPS, THE SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST, RECENTLY IMPRISONED IN DRESDEN, WEAKLEY CO., TENN., FOR WORKING ON SUNDAY, THE BOSTON GLOBE SAYS:—

It ought not to take long for the next legislature of Tennessee to wipe out the stain on the State, by enacting such laws as shall do away with all musty statutes that invite bigotry to enter upon his work. Tennessee should secure for Jews, "seventh-day" keepers and men of all shades of religious opinion, the rights which belong to them in a land supposed to be the home of freedom, of conscience, and religious liberty.

The only legislation that would accomplish that which the Globe says should be accomplished, would be an act repealing the Sunday law of the State entirely. Sunday is a religious day, and laws requiring its observance are religious laws, and interfere with the rights of every man; for no man is free to do that which he must do. The Sunday keeper is not free under a Sunday law.
