"Again, the followers of the great William Penn, who founded and once possessed the great State of Pennsylvania, who wished it ever to remain an asylum to the society of the Friends and others, from the withering and destructive breath of persecution; I say, this society regard every day alike. They must be compelled to pay a mock regard to it, or pay the forfeit to these persecuting associations called moral. With what justice may they complain that their sect is proscribed and another established by civil law. Yes, the Jews, the Sabbatarians, and the Friends are all proscribed. Yet, the constitution says 'that no human authority [not even the West Middletown Association] can in any case whatever control or interfere with the rights of conscience, and that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishments or modes of worship.'

"Yet if any of the above sects should conscientiously observe the seventh day or any other, and conscientiously drive their wagon on the Sabbath of the majority, they must appease the strong party with four dollars! O Pennsylvania, where is the shade of thy founder? Where the spirit of thy great William Penn? From what has been said it is incontrovertibly obvious that these moral associations are unconstitutional." —The Reporter, Aug. 21, 1820.
