In a recent number of Word and Work, an English religious journal, Mr. A. H. Forbes, writing from the standpoint of a member of the Church of England, supports his assertion of an immense Romeward advance in that communion by the following startling figures: Clerical supporters of ritualism, 7,000 in 1892, as against less than half that number in 1882; ritualistic churches in 1882, 2,581; in 1892, 5043; churches adopting eucharistic vestments in 1882, 336, in 1892, 1029; churches illegally using incense in 1882, 9, in 1892, 77; churches using altar lights in 1882, 581, in 1892, 2,048. In addition to these facts, says Mr. Forbes, "further figures would doubtless reveal a similar advance in banners, crucifixes, processions, adoration of the elements, confessionals, etc." And the conclusion to which all this would seem to point is that in a few years "evangelical teaching will have been crushed out of the Church of England, and that body will have become a department of the church of Rome." The only reassurance Mr. Forbes has to offer is his conviction that "the people of England will never tolerate a return to Romanism." Probably he is right in so thinking. At the same time, the growing influence of ritualism is a serious, if not alarming, fact. It finds illustration, as well as bold expression, in the book lately published by Canon W. J. Knox Little, a zealous and very able leader of the ultra-ritualistic party, who has ventured to entitle his volume, "Sacerdotalism, if Rightly Understood, the Teaching of the Church of England." He frankly denies that the Anglican Church is a Protestant Church; cuts it off wholly and absolutely from all Protestant bodies; unites it doctrinally and historically with the Roman and Greek churches; and insists on a practice and doctrine which differ from those of Rome chiefly in not conceding the infallibility of the pope. He insists on auricular confession as obligatory, considers fasting communion desirable, and defends the "non-communicating adoration of the wafer," the real presence in a form scarcely distinguishable from transubstantiation, the sacrifice of the mass, the authoritative interpretation of Scripture by the Church (not to say its authority to supplement Scripture by its own traditions), and the most literal apostolic succession in the hierarchy of the Greek, Roman, and Anglican communions, which together form one Catholic Church. There is, in short, nothing in Canon Knox Little's delineations of the English Church to justify its existence independent of the church of Rome; and while his extreme views may not be shared even by all ritualists, they undeniably show the direction in which the High Church party is tending.—Examiner.
