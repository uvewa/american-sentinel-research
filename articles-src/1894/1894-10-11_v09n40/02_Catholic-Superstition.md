A MAN was found dead recently in this city, and on his person was found a "prayer for the repose of the soul of Catherine Carr." Following the prayer was the promise that—

They who shall repeat this prayer every day, or hear it repeated, or keep it about them, shall never die a sudden death, nor be drowned in water, nor shall they fall into the hands of their enemies, nor be burned in any fire, nor shall be overpowered in battle, nor shall poison take any effect on them, and if you see any one in the fits lay this prayer on his or her right side, and he or she shall stand up and thank you. Believe this for certain which is written here; it is true as the holy evangelists. They who keep it about them shall not fear lightning or thunder, and they that repeat it every day shall have three days' warning before their death.

It is in such senseless superstitions that Rome educates her votaries, and it is to faith in such vanities that Leo XIII., pope, invites "the princes and peoples of the universe." And it is upon such superstition that "Protestants" invoke the divine blessing, saying: "God bless the Catholic Church of to-day!"
