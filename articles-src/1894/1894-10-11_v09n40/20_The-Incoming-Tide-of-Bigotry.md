THE Republican State Convention felt the effects of the A. P. A. If rumor be well founded the influence of the infamous conspiracy forced the setting aside of a gentleman who would otherwise have been the candidate of the Republicans for lieutenant-governor. The objection made to his candidature was that though he is not himself a Catholic, his wife is! . . .

Mr. Van Schaick, whoever he is, appeared at the Republican Convention as the representative of the A. P. A. and, according to the reports of his conversation published, announced that 110 of the delegates to that convention were members of the A. P. A. Of course he refused to give the names of these men. According to the regulations of this conspiracy, as exposed in the West, no member is allowed to give to the outside world the name of another member. Now it is just as well for these persons to understand that within a year or two at the farthest the names of all of them that are of any consequence will be known and published. By the oath which they have taken, they have sworn substantially to injure Catholics to the best of their ability. The proper way to punish such fanatics would be to give them a dose of their medicine, and that they will receive. Some of them are engaged in the professions, as physicians and lawyers, others in business as storekeepers. All these will be known in time and published in their own localities.—Catholic Review, New York.
