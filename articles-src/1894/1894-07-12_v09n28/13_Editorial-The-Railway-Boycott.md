One of the most significant object lessons of this very eventful year is the boycott and strike of the American Railway Union against the Pullman Company and the railroads handling the company's cars. The right of men to quit work whenever for any cause they see fit to do so cannot be denied without destroying liberty. But the right of men to combine to paralyze the business of the country, as has been done in this boycott, cannot be admitted without inviting anarchy and ruin.

To begin with, this boycott is utterly without justification. The Pullman Company found that, owing to hard times, its business was not paying and so to avoid shutting down and throwing its thousands of employés out of work its managers proposed to continue at reduced wages. This proposition the men refused. The company very naturally closed its shops. The boycott was declared by the American Railway Union to compel the Pullman Company to resume the manufacture of cars for which there is practically no demand, and that at a rate of wages dictated by the employés of the company.

To make this boycott effective the railroads must stop running Pullman cars; but this they refuse to do: hence the extensive strike of railway employés. As we said before, the employés have a right to quit work if they so desire, even for no better reason than because the Pullmans will not manufacture cars at a loss simply to keep a lot of men employed who are not willing to share the losses as well as the profits of the business in which they are employed. But the wickedness of it is in not only stopping work themselves but in insisting that others shall stop also and in inflicting every sort of hardship possible on all who refuse to curse those whom they curse.

In this boycott thousands of dollars' worth of perishable freight, fruit, ice, etc., have been sidetracked, and left to go to ruin; cars of live stock have been sidetracked and the helpless beasts left to perish for want of water. And worse yet, whole car-loads of men, women, and children, some of them invalids, have by the strikers been denied a supply of water because they happened to be occupying Pullman cars. Such atrocities very properly alienate from the strikers the sympathy that they otherwise might receive from those who recognize the fact that labor has grievances (though not in this case), and that capital is soulless, and generally without sympathy and without remorse.

The present boycott justifies a remark made in these columns last week, namely, that "capital is not alone responsible for the ills of labor. Thrift and Waste, Economy and Extravagance, must not be left out of the calculation. Nor is the assumption warranted that men with money and men without money differ essentially in their nature. The inhumanity of capital to labor is not greater than is the inhumanity of labor toward labor. Trades-unionism is quite as intolerant as capital. The inevitable conclusion is that the evils complained of are due primarily, not to any social or economic system, but to fallen human nature—wrong systems being themselves a result, rather than a cause." The truth of this has been amply demonstrated already in the great railroad boycott, and the end is not yet.

But the suffering entailed upon thousands by this boycott is not the whole of the evil, nor is it the greatest evil connected with this boycott. Local authorities have found themselves powerless to cope with this conspiracy against life and property, and the strong arm of Federal power has been invoked. This, though in a sense justified by the circumstances, is an evil to be sincerely regretted by every lover of liberty. "The domain that government invades it dominates; the jurisdiction it takes it keeps." Too late, misguided workingmen may find that instead of meeting citizen soldiers taken simply for the occasion from among the people, and so more or less in sympathy with labor, they will henceforth be called to look into the muzzles of guns in the hands of men whose trade is war, and who are so far removed from the people as to have practically no sympathy with them. But it only hastens that end of which what we see is the beginning.
