W. B. Capps, the Weakley County, Tennessee, Adventist, whose case was recently decided by the Supreme Court of that State, is now in jail, where he will have to remain, it is stated, eight months for the crime of doing ordinary farm labor on Sunday. A great many other people in Tennessee work on Sunday, railroads do business as usual, livery stables reap a harvest on that day, the judge who sentenced Mr. Capps and the attorney who prosecuted him both travel by rail on Sunday when it suits their convenience so to do, thus becoming particeps criminus with the railroads in their violation of the law, but only the Adventists are really prosecuted, for the reason that while they are prosecuted ostensibly for Sunday work they are really persecuted for Sabbath-keeping; their real offense is not in working on Sunday, but in resting on the Sabbath.
