# Uncertainties Log - Volume 9, Number 28 (1894-07-12)

## Page 1, Masthead
- **Issue:** "ALONZO Y. JONES" appears in original (likely OCR error for "ALONZO T. JONES")
- **Transcribed as:** "ALONZO Y. JONES"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** This is an obvious OCR error; Alonzo T. Jones was the editor. However, I transcribed exactly what appears in the OCR output per instructions.

## Page 1, Masthead
- **Issue:** "ABBOTANY EDITOR" appears after editors' names
- **Transcribed as:** "ABBOTANY EDITOR"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** This appears to be OCR corruption, possibly "ASSISTANT EDITOR" or similar, but transcribed as appears in source.

## Page 2, Article 1
- **Issue:** "finding his vigilance" (should likely be "eluding his vigilance")
- **Transcribed as:** "finding his vigilance"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** OCR appears corrupted, but transcribed as appears.

## Page 3, Article 1
- **Issue:** "browning like oxen" (should likely be "browsing like oxen")
- **Transcribed as:** "browning like oxen"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Context suggests "browsing" (eating grass), but transcribed as appears in OCR.

## Page 6, Article (Charging God Foolishly)
- **Issue:** "bed in shorter" (should be "bed is shorter")
- **Transcribed as:** "bed in shorter"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Biblical quote from Isaiah 28:20; obvious OCR error, but transcribed as appears.

## Page 8, Editorial note
- **Issue:** "President Dees" (should be "President Debs")
- **Transcribed as:** "Dees" in title, kept as "Dees" in article body
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** This is likely Eugene V. Debs, but transcribed as appears in OCR.

## General Note
Throughout the issue, the OCR source contains obvious formatting artifacts (page headers "AMERICAN SENTINEL" with volume/issue numbers, page numbers) that were stripped from article transcriptions as instructed. All substantive text was preserved exactly as it appeared in the OCR output, including likely OCR errors, per project instructions.
