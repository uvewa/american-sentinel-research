SOPHISTRY has force and is dangerous until brought face to face with truth.

In the June Forum, '94, the Right Rev. J. M. Farley, Vicar-General of the Diocese of New York, gave a rather orthodox view of the question of taxation of church property. He said:—

The citizen and resident, in return for protection, give their proper tax to the government and sometimes render it personal service. They have been personally benefited in a hundred ways by the orderly civil society which a good government has secured for them. They have made money, enjoyed all the relations of social life in perfect liberty, and are in debt to the government even when they have said their taxes, but the churches also have made their return for the protection accorded them. They have paid no taxes, but they have labored night and day to secure to the State the best sort of citizens. They have preached at all hours and seasons the duty of loyalty to the State, and have spent more hours than the State could pay for in looking after the poor and helpless, in preventing sin and disorder, in keeping pure and wholesome the very elements which go to make a decent State.

This writer is treating the State as a responsible institution, aside from the members of society that go to make up the State, and the Church as an independent agent employed by the State, and looking to it for protection and reward. The fact is ignored that State and Church both have distinct fields. The State to protect the temporal interests of its subjects and the Church to promote the spiritual kingdom of Christ.

If the man serves the State as a citizen and then is required in church capacity to render additional service because of the protection given his church, he is under twofold obligation. If the State protects him as a citizen and then as a church member also, he gets a superfluity of protection. Absurdity.

But there is a point worthy our careful consideration as to the office work of the Church urged in this article. It is argued that the Church is working for the State and looking to the State for its pay. Now the question is, Is the Church working for the State of is she working for Christ? This is the central issue; and it is a mixed one now, for some are clearly serving the world while others are true to Christ. But let this be borne in mind that none are serving both. Christ said, "No man can serve two masters."

When a bribe is accepted, is not the acceptance itself a tacit agreement to work for the object asked in the giving of the bribe? Is not the receipt of wages itself an agreement to do the work understood? The acceptance of the price is at once a sale acknowledged by the receiver. Thus, for the Church to receive the remittance of taxes as a stipulated price for services rendered, or to be rendered, is but to sell herself to the service of the State.

When the Church is so blind that she cannot see a glory in her calling that carries her beyond the acceptance of worldly gain in recognition of service rendered, there is great need of a reformation.

"Whoseever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God." Jas. 4:4. The great stumbling-stone which seems to divert the minds of many is treating this subject is the inborn idea that the Church has duties to the State outside of and beyond those of the individual citizens which constitute the membership of the Church.

Suppose a case in which the members of a community discharge all their duties as citizens of the Government and the Government guarantees to those citizens all that is due to them from it by the protection of persons and property, in the peaceful pursuit of happiness.

Let this community organize itself into a church and put some of its property into church buildings. Has the relation of that people to the State changed? Has the relation of the State to that people changed? Not a particle. The idea that the Church as such is doing a work for which the State became indebted to it is superstitious folly.

Let it be ever borne in mind that when a citizen has discharged his duties to the State as a law-abiding patriot, if he should become a church member, he would owe the State no more, and when the State accords to him the protection of person and property in the full enjoyment of his natural rights, its work is done, whether he is or is not a church member.

When a citizen is faithful as such to the State, he enters the Church not to work for the State, but to work for Christ. The theoretical idea is that the citizen who is a church member owes more of service to the State, and that the State is in debt to him for such service; that is to say, that the church member has more claims on the State or that he is a special favorite of the State. In other words, this plan puts a premium on church membership and church organization.
