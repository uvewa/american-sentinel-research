We print on another page a letter from Rome, to the Boston Pilot, which should afford food for reflection to those who think that we have nothing to fear from Romish aggressions. The scripture is being fulfilled: "All that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb." The only security against Romish domination is to be enrolled among the followers of Jesus Christ, and that not simply in a church book, but in the books of heaven.
