President Dees of the American Railway Union declared July 4: "The first shot fired by the regular soldiers at the mobs here [Chicago] will be the signal for civil war." What will be the immediate outcome of this railroad boycott cannot be told at this writing (July 6), but bloodshed and destruction of property seem to be inevitable in the near future.
