The Christian Statesman says that "the Presbyterian Presbytery of Washington City, at its late meeting unanimously adopted a resolution disapproving of any legislation by Congress having for its object the opening of public buildings on the Sabbath." "Dr. Byron Sunderland preached a powerful sermon against the bill on June 10," continues the Statesman, and adds, "other pastors are ready to do so if there is any danger of the bill becoming a law."
