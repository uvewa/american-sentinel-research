In Butte, Mont., July 4, two saloon-keepers adorned their saloons with the letters, "A. P. A." formed with bunting. A mob attacked one of the buildings with the avowed purpose of tearing it down. Shooting resulted, in which one man was killed and two were wounded. The United Press dispatch describes the trouble as "An A. P. A. Riot." Suppose it had been the other way about and members of the A. P. A. had been the aggressors, would it then have been a Roman Catholic riot?
