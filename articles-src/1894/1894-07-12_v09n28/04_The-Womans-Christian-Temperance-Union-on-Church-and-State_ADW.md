IN Leaflet No. 31, published by the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union for the Sabbath Observance Department, is found the following:—

Question. Does not a Sunday law favor a union of Church and State?

Answer. How can two things be united that have nothing in common? You cannot unite an organization with a principle. The organized State must unite with an organized Church, as in England and Scotland. Here no one denomination could gain such precedence. Moreover, we have State Sabbath laws, and they nowhere tend to a union of Church and State, and no more would a national law. Probably no one in the country desires such union in any form and it is rendered impossible by our Constitution. This is a veritable "man of straw."

The best way to determine whether this gentleman is made of straw is to pull off his mask and dissect him. We suspect that his looks are deciving. We think that upon examination there will be found between his appearance and his real character about the same difference that exists between a lamb and a dragon. See Rev. 13:11.

Let us approach this personage (the Bible calls him a "beast," the very image of his father, Rev. 13th chapter) with caution, for he is very nervous, and does not like to be examined. The writer of the leaflet asks, "How can two things be united that have nothing in common?" Answer. By changing one or both of the things so they will have something in common. The true Church of Christ and a properly constituted State will never have any interests in common; but when the Church loses her hold upon God and appeals to the State for power to accomplish her aims; and when the State responds to the appeal, and espouses the cause of the Church, then the two are united in their interests and methods.

This is the condition of affairs in the United States to-day. Congress is besieged with "Christian(?) lobbyists," and flooded with petitions from churches; representatives from the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union are found in the committee rooms of the capitol. Why are they there if the Church and the State have nothing in common? And why do they maintain a department of legislation if they have nothing in common with the Government? Why was the statement made at the Elgin Sunday convention, that "the interests of the Church and the State are united"? And why does Mrs. Bateham say in Leaflet No. 15 "that Christianity is part of the law of the land"? If Christianity is part of the law, then isn't the State trying to uphold Christianity and to advance its interests? And isn't that just what the Church is endeavoring to do? It is true then that they have something in common; but it is just as true that they ought not to have anything in common. It is only an apostate church and a ruined State that are united. They should neither be united nor opposed, but simply let each other alone.

"But," says the writer of the leaflet, "you cannot unite an organization with a principle." Isn't the Woman's Christian Temperance Union united to the principle of temperance, and prohibition, and Sunday legislation, as well as to many other principles? If an organization cannot unite with a principle, it can at least adopt the principle which amounts to the same thing. It is not necessary that an organized State should, by express terms, be united to an organized church in order to have a union of Church and State. A comparison of three cases will illustrate this point.

Case one: Suppose the organized State of Illinois should adopt the organized Presbyterian Church, as a State church. No one will deny that this would be a union of Church and State. Now, what would follow from such a union? Would the State pay the grocery bills of the members of this church? Would it buy their clothing? or furnish them with any of the necessities of this life?—No, nothing of the kind; that is not the purpose of such a union. The object is to secure the cooperation and assistance of the State in matters pertaining to the church. What, then, is the purpose of the Presbyterian Church? How came this organization to have an existence? There is but one answer to these questions. There were certain doctrines which some people believed should be taught and obeyed in the world. The sum of one's religious belief constitutes a religious creed; and a creed which is held by a number of individuals is a common creed. From some of its characteristics, this common creed was named "Presbyterianism," and the people who organized themselves together for the purpose of promulgating this creed constitute the Presbyterian Church. No church, as such, cares for anything except its creed; no church would ever have had an existence but for its creed. And when any church unites itself with the State, it is for the express purpose of having the State use its power and influence to secure the general adoption of its creed. The creed becomes a part of the law of the land, and the enforcement of that part of the law is religious persecution.

Case two: Let us imagine that Michigan is afraid of a union of Church and State. The people have resolved never to allow the State to be joined to any church. "But surely," they say, "it can do no harm for the State to adopt a religious creed, provided, that in the arrangement, no mention is made of a church. And as a majority of the citizens are in favor of Presbyterianism, we will have the State adopt the principles of that creed." And then they exclaim triumphantly, "No union of Church and State here; you cannot unite an organization with a principle!" But any one can see that under such an arrangement Michigan would be united to the Presbyterian Church, just as certainly as would Illinois. In both States Presbyterianism would be a part of the law of the land, and in both cases the enforcement of that part of the law would be religious persecution. Let any State adopt the Roman Catholic creed, without saying anything about the church, and see if the Woman's Christian Temperance Union would not cry, "Church and State"!

Case three: Now suppose that the State of Pennsylvania simply adopts Christianity. Would not that be a union of Church and State? If not, why not? If adopting the Presbyterian creed creates a union with the Presbyterian Church, why does not the adoption of Christianity create a union with the Christian Church? Most certainly it does. As there is but one way to benefit the Presbyterian Church, and that by the advancement of its creed, so there is but one way to help the Christian Church, and that is by propagating and sustaining its creed. Whatever is done for Presbyterianism is done for the Presbyterian Church, and the same is true of Christianity and the Christian Church. When we advance the interests of a man we benefit the man; and when we advance the interests of a church, we benefit the church.

"But," says one, "Christianity is not a persecuting religion." Of course not; hence we know that when a religious body seeks for legislation to enforce its creed, it is not a Christian organization at all, no matter how much it may claim to be such, and its creed is not Christianity. It is only a counterfeit Christianity which seeks to become a "part of the law of the land," and only a counterfeit Christian that tries to make it such.

But if the State adopts Christianity, without reference to any sect, and every one is allowed to interpret the Bible for himself, will there be persecution then? Such a thing never was done and never will be. Christianity must be defined or it cannot be enforced. You cannot call everything Christianity. If a State should profess to adopt Christianity, without definition, the courts would soon begin to define it, thus interpreting the Bible for the people. The creeds of the different so-called Christian denominations are simply so many different definitions of Christianity. The definition given to Christianity by any State constitutes the State creed, and those who accept the State creed, together constitute the State Church. Pennsylvania has adopted Christianity, as a State religion, and she has begun to define it. The State tries to enforce the observance of Sunday, as the Christian Sabbath; but this cannot be done without interpreting the Bible, and wrongly interpreting it, too.

The writer of the leaflet says, that "we have State Sabbath laws, and they nowhere tend to a union of Church and State," but she avoids giving a reason for her statement. The fact is, Sunday laws are the chief step in a union of Church and State. Perhaps the writer will ask, "Why is there no persecution from Sunday laws?" We reply, There is; a Sunday law was never enforced without persecution. And if there is a place where such laws do not persecute, it is because they are not enforced. The leaflet under review argues that because the State Sunday laws do not persecute when not enforced, therefore a national law will not persecute when it is enforced. Still air never blows anybody away, therefore how can a cyclone be dangerous?

One thing more we wish to examine in this so-called "man of straw." The writer claims that a union of Church and State "is rendered impossible by our Constitution." How is it rendered impossible? Why, the Constitution says, that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." Hence the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union acknowledges that an establishment of religion in the law of the land would constitute a union of Church and State. But if this is made impossible by the Constitution, as they say, why do they boast that this is a Christian nation, and that "Christianity is a part of the law of the land"?

This is not a "man of straw." He is a beast, and the organization that espouses him, will never be able to conceal his pedigree.
