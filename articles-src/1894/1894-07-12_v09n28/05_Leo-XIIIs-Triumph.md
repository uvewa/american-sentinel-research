Rome, June 9.

When Leo XIII began to try to bring about an understanding between Prince Bismarck and the Vatican, it was said to him: "Holy father, don't you remember that Bismarck declared he would never go to Canossa?" To this the pontiff replied: "We don't want him to go to Canossa, but he may come to Rome!" And this was brought about; and the Kulturkampf in Germany ceased; and a minister from Prussia—the late Dr. Von Schlosser—was sent to Rome to represent his government at the Vatican. This was, perhaps, one of the great triumphs of the pontiff's ability and gentle persuasiveness.

A triumph, probably still greater than even this, has just been achieved by the same pontiff. Russia, the natural enemy of Rome, the government particularly prominent amongst the governments of Europe for its persistent persecution of its Catholic subjects, has listened at length to the voice of reason, and admitted the right of the pope to seek every means of protecting his children in the faith. Diplomatic relations have been re-established between Russia and the Vatican, after a rupture that has lasted twenty-eight years! Since the time when such relations ceased between the two powers—the moral power of Rome and the material power of Russia—disagreements with other European nations arose, such as those of Prussia and Belgium with the church. These have been removed, and with great advantage to the peace of these nations. Now is the moment when another victory of Leo XIII has to be recorded, and one which cannot be more complete. A journal hostile to Catholics, but of considerable influence, the Corriere di Napoli, says: "At the office of the Secretary of State in the Vatican, they may well be proud of having brought to a satisfactory conclusion a question which was frequently threatened with shipwreck."

This re-establishment of the Russian legation to the holy see is described as a grand political and international act. The Emperor Alexander III. has comprehended fully the importance and the efficacious force of this act of reparation. In spite of its subjection to a hostile power, the papacy has regained a position to which nothing in the history of this moral power can be compared. The re-establishment of the Russian legation, says the *Moniteur de Rome*, proves what weight the pope has in the destiny of States. The voice of the public, besides, has hailed this event as a triumph of Leo XIII. Friends, and even enemies, admit this, "When a sovereign, such as Alexander III.," continues the *Moniteur*, "this silent and hesitating man, who weighs all things with the sentiment of peace, and the desire of making Russia great and powerful,—when such an emperor decides, after long negotiations, for such an initiative, it is because he has confidence in the loyalty of the pope, and that the moral ministry of the holy see is an unequalled force and help. This genius must have been attractive, and this collaboration be highly desirable, to conquer mountains of prejudices, and to cut down the granite of historic traditions."—*Special Correspondence from Rome to the Boston Pilot*.
