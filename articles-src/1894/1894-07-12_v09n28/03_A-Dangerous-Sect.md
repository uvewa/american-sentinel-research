RUSSIAN papers just to hand announce the appearance in the government of Ekaterinoslav of another of those religious sects that, while exciting the fear and disgust of the Orthodox Church, draw down upon themselves the vigorous hostility of the civil authorities. The new body is the result of a split in the Mennonite sect, mainly made up of Germans, and has established itself at Kotlarevka, under the title of "The New Mennonites." The pastor of the flock, one Edward Friedrich, recently applied to the governor of Ekaterinoslav for permission to erect a chapel, and in the investigation which followed several peculiarities in the creed of the sect were disclosed. The new Mennonites, for example, forbid the taking of oaths in legal proceedings; they are bound to refrain from hostilities and the shedding of blood, even in times of war; and they are pledged by the articles of their belief to take no part in condemning criminals to death. The governor of the province, with the sanction of the local bishop, found the sect to be "exceedingly injurious to the welfare of the empire," and refused to authorize the erection of a new Mennonite chapel. It further transpiring that the sect had been active in snatching into its fold simple and unsuspecting members of the Orthodox Church, the civil authorities sent one of the "perverts" to prison, and would have treated Rev. Friedrich in like manner had he not taken train to the frontier. In view of these eloquent facts, the Russian press proclaims, with a unanimous voice, the need of immigrant missionaries who will struggle, with all the power of the Orthodox Church, against heresies so wicked as those of the new Mennonites. Yes, it is the old story. The great pillar of autocracy in Russia to-day is the Orthodox Church, and to the autocratic party religious freedom is "Nihilism" in the domain of faith. You have only to bring rationalism into the belief of the Russian peasant, and his superstition in favor of despotism will go by the board. That is why new sects are found to be so "injurious to the welfare of the empire."—Free Russia.
