[This article, by Bishop Atticus G. Haygood, in the New York Independent, affords much food for reflection.]

A state of civil war exists in seven or eight States of the Union. There are disturbances that destroy the peace and utterly subvert the social order of many communities. Municipal and county authorities find themselves helpless in the presence of overwhelming mobs. In at least six States troops are under arms and orders.

There are several "storm centers," most of them in that part of the United States we call the North—a section of our country claiming to be governed by peculiar reverence for law and the sacred rights of man.

These evil-freighted movements, inspired by discontent and directed by revenge, have barely touched that part of the country known as "the South"—a section that is not, by many good people, considered as a pattern of the civil virtues. But for the labor outrages North it is almost certain that none would have occurred South. The exceptions prove and illustrate the statement. There are very few foreigners in the Southern States; the law-defying strikers in Alabama and Tennessee are not Americans.

Few people seem to have the least idea of the gravity of the situation. Was the bombardment of Fort Sumter more significant of danger to the most sacred things in American institutions? If, as the Northern view states the case, the attack on Fort Sumter was a shot at the Constitution, these labor riots attack the rights of men that undergird the Constitution itself.

The industries of the entire nation are disturbed. Some forms of industry are paralyzed; others are being destroyed. Trade suffers at every point. The whole people are losers in the upsetting of values and in the general maleficent influence, diffusing itself like malaria out of Mississippi swamps—throughout every sphere of honest human activity and every department of legitimate trade.

But the disturbances in trade and the upsetting of values are the least evils growing out of the present unparalleled state of things. Strikes that involve the living of several millions of the people are troubles of a very grave and portentous sort. But when strikes are attended with violence money gauges do not measure the losses that society suffers or the perils that overhang society.

When men—whether two workers or ten thousand—whose contracts are filled out, quit work they do only what they have absolute right to do. This right is complete and sacred. It is a right centered in the very heart of our institutions. So long as men simply refuse to work—meantime molesting no others in their rights—they may or may not be foolish: they are not criminal. But the moment men who have thrown down a job threaten with any form of hurt, to say nothing of death, others who wish to take it up, that moment they pass into the criminal class. They commit treason against mankind; they are in rebellion against the social order and the civil law.

They can no longer demand the protection of law; they defy law and merit its penalties; they despise in others the rights they claim for themselves. Society cannot exist if confederated men who will not work prevent, by violence, men from working who wish to work. The right to work is certainly as sacred as the right to quit work.

The continuance of such a state of things will bring anarchy complete and despotism absolute. The government that tolerates such a state of things is foolish; the government that condones it is blind; the government that winks at it is wicked; the government that cannot prevent or suppress it is weak and worthy of contempt.

That wage-earners may, or may not, have just ground of complaint against mine owners and other great corporations that employ them, plays no part in discussing their right to beat and kill other laborers for daily bread willing to do the work they refuse. That in many cases the workers, as well as those who buy the output of their labor, have grounds for complaint, few people will question for a moment.

But nothing that any mine owner, or other large employer, ever did to his employés is so bad as what some strikers do to men who—albeit they labor for bread—wish to work at jobs that strikers have thrown down. Nothing can be less justifiable than the mistreatment and killing of one set of men because we fall out with another, no matter what the objects of revenge have done or are capable of doing.

The employer may fix a scale of prices that makes living hard—even impossible; but he cannot beat and kill men to force them to work for him. But the violent striker says to his brother wage-earner: "I won't work for such prices; you shall not. If you do, I will burn down your house or break your head."

Despotism and cruel wrong cannot further go.

The strikes under consideration assert, and upon occasion practice, the right to kill those who do not agree with their views concerning economic questions; otherwise work and wages, investments and profits. By and by they will kill those who differ from them on other subjects. There is as much natural and civil right for killing people for their opinions about religion as for their notions of labor and its rewards. If one may not work today because another says he shall not, tomorrow he may not vote or pray. When personal liberty is dead there are no free institutions.

The strikers who terrorize or kill workers for bread when "strikes are on" are lynchers by wholesale.

Lynch law is an abomination, whether in the punishment of crime, or in the suppression of free opinion, free speech, or free action. Lynch law—savagery and diabolism always—is least excusable when invoked to control the free opinions or the legitimate actions of men. He who kills another because he works for bread, is an unspeakably worse man than he who kills to punish rape. The miners, as are all others who use these savage methods, are rebels against government and the social order. They should, all of them, be put down and brought into obedience to law.

A Chicago paper says of Governor Matthews that he "tells the strikers that he will quench their outbreak if it requires all the muscle and steel in Indiana for a week or a year."

This man seems to remember his oath of office and to have forgotten, for the time at least, future elections involving his political fortunes.
