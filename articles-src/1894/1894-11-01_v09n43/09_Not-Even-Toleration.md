## Not Even Toleration.

The people of the State of Maryland seem to have made up their minds that liberty to worship God according to the dictates of the individual conscience is a thing of the past. Oct. 6 and 7, in the year of our Lord, 1894, some Seventh-day Adventists were worshiping in their own house of worship, in the village of Shady Side, not far from the capital, when their place was surrounded by a mob of men who threw bricks and stones against the house, and through the windows, making such a noise that it was impossible for the minister to go on with the service. The house of worship was considerably damaged, and one of the brethren was very roughly handled by some of the men engaged in making the disturbance. The minister was informed that if he did not leave the place, he would be treated to a rope around his neck; and many other like things.

All this occurred on the first date mentioned, which was the Sabbath, and the Adventist people were informed that their meetings must be discontinued or they would be broken up. They attempted to hold meeting again on Sunday evening, and the mob again appeared, some of the men going into the house and publicly insulting the minister. On this occasion the brethren took the precaution to secure the names of fifteen or twenty of the leaders of the mob, and they were reported to the authorities. Fifteen of the men were arrested and brought before the court on Monday, the 8th, but were immediately discharged on a technicality. Many of the men implicated in this lawless business were members of so-called Protestant churches of the place; but while these men escape justice, the poor Adventist minister will probably have to serve a term in jail for picking up a few tent stakes on Sunday morning, one of these good people having been stationed to watch him. Truly, "justice standeth afar off; . . . and equity cannot enter."—Allen Moon, in Advent Review and Sabbath Herald.
