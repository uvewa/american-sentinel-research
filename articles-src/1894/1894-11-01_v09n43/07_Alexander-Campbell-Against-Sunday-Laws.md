Alexander Campbell Against Sunday Laws.

[In 1820 there was organized in West Middletown, Washington Co., Pa., a society, called the West Middletown Moral Society. The principal object of the society was to enforce the Pennsylvania Sunday law of 1794, which is still on the statute books of the State. This Moral Society was organized by the United Presbyterian, the same people who, later in 1863, organized the National Reform Association. Alexander Campbell, the founder of the Christian or Disciple Church, ably opposed the society in a series of articles published in the Reporter, of Washington, county seat of Washington County. His articles were signed "Candidus." A United Presbyterian minister, by the name of Wylie, attempted to defend the society, and signed himself "Timothy." The discussion continued from April 17, 1820, the date of Mr. Campbell's first article, to February 22, 1822, during which time almost every phase of the compulsory Sunday law question was treated. As a result the Moral Society perished, not to appear again until 1863 when it was revived by the same denomination under the name, National Reform Association. Every word of Mr. Campbell's invincible logic and withering denunciation is applicable to the association, resuscitated under the name, National Reform Association, and kindred organizations, such as the American Sabbath Union, the Pennsylvania Sabbath Association, etc.]

I HAVE no idea of pronouncing unqualified censures on the judge's address.* As a citizen of respectability, and as a president of a civil court, he is entitled to respect; and, although I may conceive that there are some defects in his knowledge of the subject on which he writes, I am constrained to respect the benevolence and goodness of intention that seems to have dictated his remarks. With far the greater part of his observations I heartily concur, but I must beg leave to dissent from some things he has said from a conviction that they are not accordant with the letter or spirit of Christianity. Many things may appear rational and religious and be highly esteemed amongst men that are not esteemed nor commended by the author of the Christian faith. The whole Bible is a comment upon this.

In number one of the judge's address on the "Institution of the Sabbath," he says many excellent things on the nature and inevitable consequences of vice and immorality, both as they affect this life and that which is to come. True it is, indeed, that "righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people." The judge unhappily weakens the force of his own remarks by applying them to support a law which is not compatible with pure virtue and pure morality. This I shall attempt to exhibit in the sequel.

He tells us that one clause of the law on which he comments, passed in the year 1794, "prohibits all worldly employment on Sunday, except works of necessity and charity," and a proviso of the same law authorizes "preparation of necessary food," etc., also the sale of the necessaries of life before nine in the morning and after five in the afternoon in our public markets.

My objections to this are the following:

1st. Because it is intended to compel all citizens, without respect to any conscientious conviction, to observe a day in one sense only, by abstaining from industrial employments which in some instances only facilitates the commission of crime and greatly increases those very vices and immoralities which the judge himself bewails. To instance this, I will only mention one fact known to many, viz., that hundreds of men, nay thousands, commit more sin in being compelled to refrain from the daily business of life on this day than they do on any other day of the week. The wagoner, so often fined for driving his team on this day, ninety-nine times in every hundred, spends the day worse in lying by than in traveling.

2nd. It tends to oppress the consciences of some who conscientiously observe the seventh, and cannot conscientiously observe the first day; such as Jews and Seventh-day Baptists.

3rd. The obedience which the law constrains is neither pleasing to God nor profitable to men. The man who observes the first day merely because the law requires him, performs not that kind of obedience which flows from the heart, and consequently it is with him an unwilling service.

4th. The law itself is unjust, inasmuch as it is partial. It consults the taste and voluptuousness of the genteel folks in large cities, by allowing them to go to market morning and evening to buy such things as may satisfy their craving appetite, while it would fine the poor farmer for saving his harvest, or gathering the labors of the year, a work of much greater importance than buying and selling fresh oysters, melons, leeks, and onions, or a fresh beefsteak before sermon, or even after they return from worship.

A fifth objection I have to the law commended by the judge is that the law itself is on its own principles lame, because it does not secure anything to the interests of even common religion or morality, because that while it prohibits many from industry allowable on all other days, it allows them to spend the day reading newspapers, writing letters of business or amusement, talking politics, or speculating upon any carnal or temporal topic. This I say it allows because its jurisdiction extends not to such things, but merely to overt acts on the highway or in the field.

These are, with me, insuperable objections to the whole system of civil interposition to sanctify the first day of the week. As the main drift of the judge's address was to recommend and enforce the above law, it detracts from the merits of his good observations, and makes them subservient to an unjustifiable end. I must here add that I cannot advocate any system of coercion in religion, nor anything that even looks like it, believing that every such system is a vain attempt, to substitute a formal and mock obedience for an honest, sincere and devout regard to the institutes of Christianity. Far be it from my intention, and from my remarks to weaken the attachment of all true Christians to the observance of the first day of the week according to the Christian institutes. It is and it has long been a maxim with me that he cannot be a Christian who does not regard and sanctify the first day of the week to the Lord.

But it is as absurd with me to compel men to pay regard to the first day of the week who do not acknowledge and feel their obligation to Him whose day it is, as to compel men to sit down at the communion table and pay a mock regard to the death of Christ. And I must add my conviction, that all those whose regard to it in any shape is compulsory, would be better employed in plowing or reaping, in planting or building, than in yielding a forced respect to it.

It is a fact worthy to be noticed, that no prophet or apostle, no inspired man in Old or New Testament times, ever dropped a word against Sabbath-breakers amongst any other nation than the Jews.** Amongst all the sins that proved the ruin of Sodom and Gomorrah, Babylon and Nineveh, Greece and Rome, that of Sabbath-profanation is never mentioned. Nor was it until Constantine married the Church and the State that a civil law was passed requiring from all ranks and degrees of men, a civil respect to this institution. I could here transcribe the first law published on the subject, were it necessary for my purpose, and from facts incontrovertibly prove that formality and hypocrisy began from that very day to stalk abroad with shameless aspect.

I have often observed that when men become advocates for any unscriptural and irrational practice in religion, it is to be traced to something fundamentally wrong in their doctrinal views of religion, and therefore I fear that the judge in the following remark too much countenances a system anti-evangelical in its tendency. He says that "nothing but a life of piety and obedience to the laws of heaven will procure final happiness beyond the grave," and "that meekness, charity and forgiveness are indispensable conditions of obtaining our own forgiveness." If such were the judge's views of the ground and condition of a sinner's admission into heaven, it is to me, by no means surprising, that he should so far mistake the nature of that observance which the Christian religion demands to its institutes. And still less strange that the leading members of the Middletown club should wish to promulgate his sentiments.—Candidus (Alexander Campbell), in Washington (Pa.) Reporter, January 12, 1821.

*Of course the readers of the SENTINEL will understand that we do not agree with Mr. Campbell that Sunday is the Lord's day. The marvel is that so candid and able a man should have entertained such an idea. However, the Sabbath question was not then as prominent as now, the Lord having reserved it as the final test of loyalty to himself. But the fact that Mr. Campbell did believe Sunday to be the Lord's day is significant in this connection as showing that his opposition to Sunday laws was not due to opposition to Sunday as a so-called Christian institution, but rather the contrary.

**We do not by this understand Mr. Campbell to teach that all men who did not keep the Sabbath were not guilty of the sin of Sabbath-breaking, but that they were not charged with that sin by any prophet or apostle simply because the Sabbath being a spiritual institution, which he kept most of all who yield themselves to God, become spiritual, and thus be in a condition to keep the Sabbath. The Sabbath was made for man, that is, for the race; but it was made before the fall, and was, primarily, for the race in its unfallen condition. To receive the blessing there is in the Sabbath man must be created anew in Jesus Christ.—EDITORS SENTINEL.
