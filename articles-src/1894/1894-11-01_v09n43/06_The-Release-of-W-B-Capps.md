## The Release of W. B. Capps.

The arrest and imprisonment of W. B. Capps, in Dresden, Tenn., for working on Sunday, after having observed the seventh day as the Sabbath, has been noticed several times in the Daily Press.

This man was fined and declined to pay the fine, as it was to his mind a sort of acknowledgment that he was guilty of some offense; and the result was that he was sentenced to 442* days at hard labor.

Subscriptions for the support of the family of Mr. Capps were asked for in the Press, and small sums were received and forwarded.

A subscription was asked for in the American Hebrew, a Jewish paper (although the imprisoned man was a Christian of the Seventh-day sect), and something like $65 was received. Then the question was raised as to how the money was to be used, and it was deemed to be best to liberate the man, and let him care for his family in his own good way. As it was reported that the imprisoned man did not relish surrendering his conscience by paying an unjust fine, it was decided to send the money direct to the clerk of the court at Dresden, and, without consulting the prisoner, pay the fine. This was done, and the man had no alternative but to go free, and he gladly did so under the circumstances, feeling much the same as though an angel had opened the door of the prison.

This was not all. The same mail which transmitted the check to the clerk in payment of the fine, carried another check for a liberal amount, to the released man, to start him anew in life, and to return him to his wife and four children who were being punished the same as the convicted man, by his imprisonment.

This is a remarkable instance of the extending of aid by the Jews to a Christian, in trouble through religious persecution, and has many pleasant features growing out of the liberal and the kindly expressions that were contained in the letters transmitting the sums of money that went to make up the contributions, and in the correspondence relative to the releasing of the man. Not among the least was the letter of thanks from the released man to the editor of the American Hebrew, for the great act of kindness so Christianly done.

Surely it is a good thing to see brethren of varying faith united in the common cause of humanity and doing these broad-minded and manly deeds.—Daily Press, Plainfield, N. J., Oct. 6.

*This is a mistake; the term of imprisonment amounted to only 250 days. The error was made in the first place by the clerk of the court when figuring up the costs.
