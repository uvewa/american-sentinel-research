Books for the Children.

MOTHERS and others who have the care of small children are often at their wits' end to know what to get in the shape of books which will at once interest and instruct the little ones in the first and simple principles of the Bible, and give them a knowledge of the Saviour. With this thought in mind we have examined and can heartily recommend the books advertised in another column of this paper under the above heading.

"Bible Pictures and Stories," and "Little Folks' Bible Gallery," are companion volumes, although either one is complete without the other. They are similar in make-up, but the same story or picture is not repeated. The language of the books is such as to commend it to the good sense of older folks; for while it is simple it is not silly.

"The Good Shepherd" is of the same class of books, but confines itself particularly to the life of the Lord, which it narrates in a style most pleasing and dignified, yet so plain and easy, that the youngest can readily understand it. It is, withal, quite free from doctrinal errors. The book is fully illustrated, many of the pictures occupying a full page. The most of the illustrations are new and are not to be found in any other book.

The little ones cannot fail to be interested in the nice pictures, and learn many good things from them. These books will make most acceptable presents to the little tots for birth-days, etc.
