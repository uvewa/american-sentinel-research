## Significant Paragraphs.

[We publish under this heading paragraphs more or less significant, without either approval or dissent, and without comment. The careful observer of the signs of the times will readily discern the pertinent facts and opinions, and will know how to turn them to account in the great controversy between truth and error.]

## An Evil Disease Upon Them.

OCCASIONALLY we have had occasion to condemn the misconduct of Methodist churches in the matter of improper exhibitions. This time we notice the following: "An Entertainment entitled Living Pictures Copied from Famous Paintings of the World and a very Amusing French Farce, will be Given in an Inclosed Tent for the Benefit of the Building Fund of the Fourth Presbyterian Church." This is in an Indiana city. A corrupting disease seems to attack the churches indiscriminately. Let every genuine Christian frown upon its manifestations.—Christian Advocate, New York, Oct. 18.

## Whose Image Is Here?

THE September issue of the Sunday Reform Leaflets lets light upon the inside of the case of Private Cedarquist, who was released from punishment for refusing Sunday duty by order of President Cleveland. The President was prompted to the action by the manager of the Sunday League, who, upon learning of the case, sent a vigorous letter calling Mr. Cleveland's attention to it and calling for a remission of the penalty. The reasons for asking for the pardon were stated to be that Sunday target practice, which the man had refused, was a violation of the law of Nebraska, of Cedarquist's religious convictions, and of Christian civilization. The letter continues: "Since the Supreme Court of the United States decided in the 'Holy Trinity' case on the 29th day of February, 1892, that 'this is a Christian nation,' and said opinion, rendered by Justice Brewer, was concurred in by every other justice, the said Private Cedarquist had a right to expect that no regulation or requirements would be made in the army of this nation out of harmony with the general laws and customs of that type of Christianity which our history has illustrated." That is, this is a Christian nation; and we have a right to expect it to enforce that type of Christianity which we believe in—the Sunday institution.

The leaflet goes on to state that "President Cleveland was very prompt and vigorous in his attention to the case."

But the circumstance proves clearly that the importance of Justice Brewer's decision in its bearings on the fulfillment of prophecy, has not been overestimated. It is the sense of the National Reform party that by its decision the Supreme Court has placed Christian usages and institutions upon so strong a legal basis that the army must respect them, even in emergencies of civil law. Not only so, but the executive department fully coincides in this opinion, and leaps with alacrity at the opportunity thus to place itself on record. The Supreme Court being beyond appeal, the national Constitution and laws being subject to its dicta, its sentiments upheld by a strong popular sentiment controlling the executive and legislative departments of the Government, who can withstand the force of its decrees?

The Supreme Court says that this nation is built on Christian lines, it is modeled after religious ideas, and bears the impress and superscription of the religion of its founders—IT IS A CHRISTIAN NATION. The people shout, Amen; make it so. The President overleaps his prerogative in his anxiety to patronize public demand, and Congress was even more ready to respond to the call of the church. But a nation constructed on religious lines, bearing that impress, pledged to the maintenance of religious dogmas, and accepting the appellation of "Christian," is an exact image of the papacy. The Supreme Court says that all this is so. What more remains to make it so?—Advent Review and Sabbath Herald.

## Ritualistic Extremes in England.

THERE seems to be abundant warrant for the existence of such a society in England as the National Protestant Church Union. Its main object is to antagonize the ultra ritualistic tendencies which prevail so widely in the Anglican Church.

A memorial lately presented by this association to the English archbishops and bishops gives some startling facts. High church service books are shown to contain teaching of the most un-Protestant and unscriptural sort. Confession, penance, and absolution; the mass and priestly sacrifices; the adoration of the Virgin Mary and prayers to the saints—these are among the doctrines and practices unequivocally advocated. An extract is given regarding the communion, which sufficiently indicates the general tone: "When the priest begins the prayer, that which is on the altar is bread and wine. When the priest ends the prayer, that which is on the altar is Christ's body and blood; it is Jesus; it is God. Who does this? The priest acting for Jesus in the power of the Holy Ghost." The tolerance which would make room in the same church for all shades of religious opinion becomes a reductio ad absurdum when it allows such undisguised popery as this under the shelter of so-called Protestantism.—The Examiner, Baptist.
