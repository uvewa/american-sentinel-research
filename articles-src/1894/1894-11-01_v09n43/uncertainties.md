# Uncertainties Log - American Sentinel v09n43 (1894-11-01)

## General Notes

This issue was transcribed from Mistral OCR output. The OCR quality was generally good, but several corrections were made for obvious OCR errors while preserving original spelling and punctuation.

## Corrections Made

### Page 1
- Line 20-21: OCR formatting of editors' names was clarified to show proper layout

### Page 2
- Line 63: "Judges, Sabbath" appears to be an OCR error for "Jewish Sabbath" - corrected based on context
- Line 79: "architechops" corrected to "archbishops" (obvious OCR typo)

### Page 3
- Line 159: "Enchiridion" preserved as printed (Latin title)

### Page 4
- Line 234: "Christianity done" appears awkward but preserved as OCR output suggests this may be the original text
- Line 267: Footnote marker appears mid-sentence - preserved as in OCR

### Page 5
- Line 289: "Ellet J. Waggoner" - name spelling preserved as appears in OCR (may be "Ellet" or "Ellett")

### Page 7
- Line 330-341: Footnote numbering (67-70) appears to be reference numbers from original source book - preserved

### Page 8
- Line 473: "brevity" should likely be "having" but preserved as OCR output to maintain accuracy

## OCR Uncertainty Notes
