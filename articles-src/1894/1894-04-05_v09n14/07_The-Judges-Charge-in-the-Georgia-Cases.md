In the trial of Messrs McCutchen and Keck, at Gainesville, Ga., for Sunday labor, the entire plea of the prosecution was that "Sunday is the day fixed by the State of Georgia upon which work cannot be done. Whether it is the Sabbath of the Bible is none of our business, but to stick to the Georgia law, for it is that under which we live."

The charge of the judge to the jury had particular reference to that phrase of the statute prohibiting the following of one's "ordinary calling" on Sunday, and was substantially as follows:—

"Gentlemen of the jury: This is an indictment against W. A. McCutchen and E. C. Keck, charging them with misdemeanor, that is, working on the Lord's day. You will see the charge fully set out in the indictment which you have.

"The indictment is founded upon this statute:—

Any tradesman, artificer, workman or laborer, or other person whatever, who shall pursue their business or work of their ordinary callings upon the Lord's day (works of necessity or charity only accepted), shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

"This is the law under which these defendants are indicted. So, if the evidence proves that the defendants, within two years before the finding of the indictment, in this case, and in this county, pursued their business or work of their ordinary callings upon the Lord's day as charged in the indictment, you will be authorized to find them guilty.

"The Lord's day, as used in this statute, means the day known as Sunday.

"You will notice, gentlemen, that the statute reads where any persons 'pursue their business or work of their ordinary callings.' Notice the language of the law!

"I charge you, that under this statute, you cannot rightfully find the defendants guilty unless the proof shows that the work, if any, done by them, was in pursuance of their business or work of their ordinary callings. 'Ordinary calling' means the business or occupation which a person usually pursues to obtain profit, or support, or livelihood.

"It is not enough to prove that the defendants did work on the Lord's day. It is not a crime, under the law, merely to work on that day; to make it so it must be done in pursuance of the business or work of the ordinary calling of the person who does it. To illustrate: If one, whose business or ordinary calling is to buy and sell goods, were to repair a public road on a Sunday, this would be no crime, especially, if it should be done gratuitously. We have nothing to do with the question of its being morally right or wrong. It is our duty to enforce the law as we find it; we are not to go beyond it.

"You are to determine what the evidence proves or does not prove, and fairly and impartially find whether or not the defendants are guilty under the evidence and the law.

"If, after you have carefully examined all the testimony in the case, weighed it carefully and impartially, under the rules given in this charge to you,—I say, if after you have done that, you have a reasonable doubt in your minds whether the defendants are guilty or not, and that doubt arises from the evidence or want of evidence, it will be your duty to give the defendants the benefit of that doubt and find them not guilty.

"The defendants have each made a statement in this case in their own defense, and these statements are to have such force only as the jury may think right to give them, and the jury may believe such statements in preference to the sworn testimony in the case.

"We have nothing to do with the question as to whose religious belief is right. You are not to determine whether you or the defendants are right. That is a question we have nothing to do with now. You are to determine fairly and impartially whether the defendants are guilty according to the evidence and the law. Nothing else should influence you in making your verdict.

"You are not obliged to find both defendants guilty or not guilty. The evidence may show one guilty and the other not. If you should determine one guilty and the other not, then you will find a verdict accordingly; that is, you will say: We, the jury, find the defendant (naming him) guilty, and we find the other defendant (naming him) not guilty. If you find them both guilty, the form of your verdict will be: We, the jury, find the defendants guilty. If not guilty say: We, the jury, find the defendants not guilty. Retire, gentlemen, and make up your verdict."

In the course of the trial it had been made clearly known that the occupation of one of the defendants was that of a minister and the other that of a teacher, yet for all this the jury, after remaining out sixteen hours, failed to agree, and the cases went over for a second trial.
