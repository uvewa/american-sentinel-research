The religio-political portion of the "Woman's Christian Temperance Union, local, State, national, and world-wide, has one vital, organic thought, one all-absorbing purpose, one undying enthusiasm, and that is that Christ shall be this world's king; yea, verily, this world's king in its realm of cause and effect,—king of its courts, its camps, its commerce, king of its colleges and cloisters, king of its customs and constitutions. . . . The kingdom of Christ must enter the realm of law through the gateway of politics."

Has not the desire of the union been realized? perhaps not just as it expected, neither did Christ come the first time as the religious leaders expected, but he came as the prophecy said he would, though because of their blindness and desire for self-aggrandizement they did not see the fulfillment of the prophecy; and so it is now. Has not the kingdom of Christ already entered through the gateway of politics and Christ become this world's king with his seat of government at Washington? Bishop Coxe says truly that "the President is a citizen who comes and goes. He is a guest who tarries but a night. The vice-president has no official house in Washington. . . . The one irremovable potentate (Potentate,—one who possesses great power; a prince; a sovereign; a king—Webster), is the Roman pontiff . . . and that as Queen Victoria by her viceroy reigns as empress in India, so henceforth Leo XIII. and his successors reign on the Potomac."

Now, is not Leo "Christ's vicegerent" (substitute) on the earth? and, as he is not ubiquitous, when he particularly takes possession of the United States he sends his substitute. A late Catholic work says, "Surely God's plans are manifest. America is the last and greatest of nations, and he means to possess her for himself." Paul, in speaking of the pope, says: "He as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God." 2 Thess. 2:4; and, as is well known, he and his followers do call him God.

Now, if God, in the person of his earthly substitute, the pope, means to possess America for himself, and has, for that express purpose, sent Satolli as his substitute, another god or christ, to reign as the "one irremovable potentate" at Washington, and as he has entered "through the gateway of politics (Bishop Coxe says the horse called in the rider, Satolli), has not the "all-absorbing purpose," the "undying enthusiasm" of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union been realized, and is not Christ(?) already enthroned at Washington as king, in the person of Satolli? And surely, according to Bishop Coxe, his reception by the people was much more befitting a king than was that of the Babe of Bethlehem. And now it is in order for the Roman-Catholic-National-Reform-religio-political-Woman's Christian-Temperance-Union combination to go and worship their king, for Christ Jesus has said that "all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world." Rev. 13:8. And whose names are not written there? Jesus said, "Who-soever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven." Matt. 10:33.

On the memorable night of his betrayal he said to Pilate, "My kingdom is not of this world." And when, as is recorded in John 6:15, the people would take him by force and make him king he departed from them. Have not those who declare that Christ "shall be this world's king" denied these words of his and tried by force to make him king, and by so doing been left to worship the beast according to the prophecy of Rev. 13:8? And does not this "irremovable potentate" just as nearly represent the "Prince of Peace" as any that can ever come through the gateway of politics?
