A CORRESPONDENT sends us the following proclamation:—

STATE OF CONNECTICUT.

BY HIS EXCELLENT,

LUZON B. MORRIS, Governor.

## A Proclamation.

I hereby appoint Friday, the 23rd day of March, as a day of fasting and prayer.

It has been the custom of the people of this commonwealth, for many years, to observe this day by meeting in their places of public worship and invoking the blessings of Heaven upon this country. The minds of the people seem so greatly at variance concerning the things needful for their happiness, that it would be well for them to continue the custom of observing this day, and in their invocation say, "O Jesu hominana Subsetse, with thy gracious light illumine the minds of thy children, who, groping in darkness, are unable to see the truth when it is presented to them."

Given under my hand and seal of the State at the capitol in Hartford, this thirteenth day of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and ninety-four, and of the independence of the United States the one hundred and eighteenth.

LUZON B. MORRIS.

By his excellency's command:

JOHN J. THELAN, Secretary.

Upon this the sender comments thus briefly but pertinently:—

The foregoing affords a large amount of food for reflection. The masses do not know how to pray and they do not know the truth when they see it. So our dear governor tells us how to pray and it is natural to suppose that the time is near for the executive to define the truth. "But none of the wicked shall understand, but the wise shall understand." Dan. 12:10.

Certainly if it is the province of the executive to direct the religious services of the people thus far he might go one step farther and instruct them in the "truth." And the legislature of Connecticut might provide a penalty for disregard of his excellency's instructions as to the exact time and form of prayer.
