The following letter is deserving of careful consideration because of its evident candor. We shall point out its defects in an after comment:—

North Adams, Mass., Feb. 18, 1894.

To the Editor of the American Sentinel.—Dear Sir: A few copies of the AMERICAN SENTINEL were sent to me by a friend, and I tender my hearty thanks for this favor.

As it is naturally becoming to be interested in the welfare of one's own family, I take this opportunity to present the truth collected in my capacity, hoping it will serve this aim. Surely it will do so when we consider that gold is a precious metal, whether it is in the hands of kings or in the hand of the least titled soldier. Now, then, having taken time to consider your thoughts, I find that my knowledge coincides entirely with your statement, and I fully realize that "to cherish the Roman Catholic ecclesiastical body is to cherish a venomous viper." I hope people will understand that we do not hate the Roman Catholic people, but we condemn the cooperation of their priests, which results in the poverty of the people under them, both mentally and financially—I mean in giving them poor education and in taking away their money. This is not done in other sects. My knowledge that the Roman Catholic ecclesiastical body is an evil and a wise serpent in managing to get power over people, teaching them to be obedient to their will, in order to keep them down is a manifest fact to the observer, as also to me in my experience (experience is God's visible truth on earth) at my home, in Syria (Asia), that the people were by them so degenerate that, in the towns, there were none that knew how to write or read except the priests. Ignorance and its vices that prevailed there I am ashamed to mention.

Not until the free spirited missionaries of England and of this Republic went and changed the darkness into light did the people exhibit even the common virtues of Christianity in their daily lives. So much about the history of the papacy in my own experience. It still remains for me to give the truth concerning your remarks in relation to the Protestants of the present day. May I say there is no doubt the excited and enthusiastic actions of the National Reform brethren (though sincere in themselves) have been unwise, and the proof is evident. Yet pardon is one of God's attributes. Allow me therefore to present, on their behalf, an argument which points out an easy way to their pardon and peace, and the prevention of remonstrance and reproof on your part, and may it, by God's help, bring union and fellowship with our brethren, and may all differences be settled wisely. Maxim: "The blows of a brother are better than the kisses of an enemy." My argument is, while it is a virtue to resist temptation it is also a virtue and wise to be far removed from them. In a community of a Christian majority—as the heads of a family are concerned in removing the temptations from before their children, so are they concerned and ought to have the privilege to govern their community to their best ability by removing iniquitous persons, prohibiting liquors and keeping the Lord's day without disturbance. The same is true of a majority of any other religious community, that they may rule their children according to the dictates of their own conscience. This may be granted without affecting the general republic or the government of the world. In so doing it would show the difference in temporal and spiritual development between a Christian ruled community and any other community; so that when reformation is needed in any place missionaries may be sent to them as they are sent to foreign lands; thus no individual is obliged to be ruled by a community so long as he can remove himself, unless he wants to stay thereat. This would make religion deal temporally and spiritually with her children. To Christians (you may know and rightly so) freedom of conscience in religion is all happiness, and to deprive them from acting and ruling their community is to deprive them of both temporal and spiritual blessings. Is it right, then, to say to a Christian, you must not have your religious principles rule in the community or in this world? When he could do so with blessings both to himself and his offspring? I hope not.

Christianity, or God, to me is the backbone of all good government, and the giver of all good gifts, and I must show this in all my actions, bodily and spiritually. This is all my belief. Now, then, I am your Protestant brother for a free republic, with the privilege of granting a majority of Protestants or others to have their own rule, not infringing upon the laws of the general republic or the government of the world.

In regard to the sanctity of Sabbath as a day, I may state that while I know of no declared change of the day, in the New Testament, into the first day of the week, yet I do know of a spiritual change of the Jewish Sabbath. The Jews called our Saviour a Sabbath-breaker, but he taught them that the Sabbath to him is not a law of Moses, a day of complete rest, but a day of doing good. In the same way he submitted to Jewish dispensation or God's dispensation to the Jews to fulfill the prophecies, but afterwards taught a more complete dispensation, that while circumcision was not declared null, it was declared to be essentially an inward circumcision of the heart. And that while the Sabbath day was not changed in its period into the first day, it was changed spiritually into the assurance of salvation. The resurrection from the dead, the triumphant victory—what other victory has been more spiritually contemplated? Faith is now completed! Especially when we know that it is a change of time but spiritually modified. Shall then any man dispute and say a "Romish Challenge?" I refer them to the fourteenth chapter of Romans commencing with the fifth verse: "One man esterneth one day above another: another esterneth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. He that regardeth the day he regardeth it unto the Lord, and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it." Both are blessed according to one's conviction.

Closing with do not forget to teach the young the truth as in the Bible, and that is shown by Protestants in general (in spite of the existing petty differences of sincere opinions), emphasizing the steady and deep piety and morality therein! And do not forget to throw the light on the snaring grounds—Romanism.

Your brother in Christ,

GABRIEL ARBOTT.

We take it that the gentleman who writes this letter is a missionary, and that most of his life has been spent in a foreign land, where his religion was tolerated, though regarded as an evil. He seems to be entirely honest in his convictions, but is evidently unacquainted with the question. His proposition, carried to its logical conclusion, is as far-reaching, and would prove as disastrous to liberty of conscience as would the policy of Ignatius Loyola himself. Our correspondent's own rule would have justified the majority in that land had they excluded both himself and his religion from Syria. If the principle is good for anything it must be as good in Asia as in America. But "Christianity" has been forced upon many foreign lands at the cannon's mouth while its missionaries have insisted upon the right of the majority in so-called Christian lands to rule even in matters of faith and to protect themselves and their children against the influence of false doctrine from whatever source.

Christian missionaries going into Syria or any other non-Christian country necessarily assail the most cherished beliefs of the majority of the people, and teach doctrines utterly abhorrent to the great mass of the people. They embrace every opportunity to inculcate their doctrines, teaching the people publicly and privately, in mission and from house to house. They proselyte young and old, gathering the children into schools and there instructing them in a religion diametrically opposed to the faith of their parents. And they deny the right of the parents to put a stop to this work by expelling them from the country. Were the authorities to drive them out or even to permit the people to do so, the missionaries would appeal to their home governments for "protection," and the result would be, at least has often been, that the people would be compelled to let the work go on.

Now we have no fault to find with the missionaries for insisting on their right to teach the gospel without molestation either from the government or from individuals. We wish simply to point out the inconsistency of their position for they very frequently assert rights in other lands that they would deny to others in their own land.

The so-called Protestant principle expressed by our correspondent amounts to no more than the popish principle, namely, "When we are in the minority you must tolerate us, because we are right; but when we are in that majority we will persecute you because the truth cannot tolerate error." This is the real position of National Reform the world over, for it is dominated by the same spirit everywhere, namely, the spirit of the enemy of all real liberty. The Saviour recognized this fact when he said to the persecuting Jews, "Ye are of your father, the devil; and the works of your father ye will do." Our correspondent has probably never heard the infamous utterance of that eminent National Reformer, Rev. E. B. Graham, yet he says substantially the same thing. Mr. Graham said, in a National Reform Convention at York, Neb., in May, 1885: "If the opponents of the Bible do not like our Government and its Christian features, let them go to some wild, desolate land; and in the name of the devil, and for the sake of the devil, subdue it, and set up a government of their own on infidel and atheistic ideas, and then, if they can stand it, stay there till they die." If anybody does like not the tyranny of so-called Christian government he can become an exile from home and friends; he can do as did Roger Williams, seek an asylum in the wilderness. This is the religion of National Reform, whether in Syria or in America; but the religion of our Lord Jesus Christ is, "All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." The one is a divine conception, the other is from the enemy of God and of man.
