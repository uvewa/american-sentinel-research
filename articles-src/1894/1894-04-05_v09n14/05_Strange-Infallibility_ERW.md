In the Catholic Mirror of October 21, 1893, the following statement appeared:—

The ripplings of Cardinal Gibbons' influence cross the threshold of the Vatican. Leo, the mighty inspirer of men, is inspired and encouraged by his lieutenants, from whom he often asks: "Watchman, what of the night?" The historic incident of the Knights of Labor, whose condemnation Cardinal Gibbons averted by personal interview with Leo, was one of the preparations to the encyclical on the "Condition of Labor." But Cardinal Gibbons is an American; let him be judged from America.

Look at it: "Cardinal Gibbons' influence crossed the threshold of the Vatican," and "averted" what otherwise would have been "condemnation," turning the threatened anathema into a blessing.

But suppose the cardinal had remained at home and Leo had carried out his intentions according to his own "judgment," then what? then the encyclical would have contained the opposite of what it did contain by reason of the cardinal's "personal interview with Leo."

As it is, it is infallibly true. But what made it what it is? Oh! the cardinal's "personal interview." Question: Can two things, directly opposite to each other, both be infallibly true? If not, whose "judgment" was the infallible guide in this case?—Plainly the cardinal's.

In his book, "The Faith of Our Fathers," the cardinal says, page 155: "The Roman pontiff is called the head of the whole church, that is, the visible head. Now the church, which is the body of Christ, is infallible. . . . But how can you suppose an infallible body with a fallible head? How can an erring head conduct a body in the unerring ways of truth and justice?"

On page 154, he says:—

The council acknowledges them to be the supreme and infallible arbiters of faith.

Again, page 148:—

The pope, as successor of St. Peter, Prince of the Apostles, by virtue of the promises of Jesus Christ, is preserved from error of judgment when he promulgates to the church a decision on faith or morals.

In the case referred to in the Mirror, the "supreme" "infallible" "head of the whole church," was "preserved from error of judgment" by the "personal interview" of Cardinal Gibbons. Now, since the "judgment" of the cardinal was that which was contained in the encyclical and not the "judgment" of the pope, who, in this case, was the "infallible" "head?" And if the cardinal was the "infallible guide" in this matter, why may he not be in other matters? How long before the cardinal will become the pope of Rome? Truly, "Leo, the mighty inspirer of men, is inspired by his lieutenants"—not by the Lord.

E. R. WILLIAMS.
