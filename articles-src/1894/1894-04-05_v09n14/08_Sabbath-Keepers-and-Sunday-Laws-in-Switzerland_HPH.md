It was not long after we began working on Sunday as on other working days in our Basle publishing house until a policeman came into the office one Sunday, and called our attention to the fact that we were violating the Sunday law. We took pains to explain to him our position and the reason why we worked. He listened attentively, and in a very friendly manner replied that we were entirely correct in our position; still he was under oath to report all violations of the law, and would have to report our work.

In a few days a notice from the police informed us that we were fined twenty francs ($4) for working on Sunday without permission. We promptly returned the notice, stating that we did not submit to the fine. This led to the appointment of a time for a hearing in the police court, giving us an opportunity to show why we did not submit to the fine. At the appointed hour, the writer appeared for the house, as the director is personally held accountable before the law. After usual preliminaries, the judge asked on what ground we refused to pay the fine. I replied that we did not pay it because we had a right to work,—permission and even a command to do so. The court then asked where we obtained our permission to work on this day. Herespon, I drew a German Bible from my pocket, and turning to Exodus 20, was about to read verses 9 and 10 when the judge asked for the Bible and the reference. He then read, "Six days shalt thou labor," and closing the Bible without reading further, replied that he still remembered that much of his Bible; and without giving me opportunity to speak further, proceeded to state that the case could not be appealed, but we could enter complaint against the fine as unjust in the court of appeals, and in this manner the case might go up to the supreme court. He then dismissed the case.

The manner in which the hearing was conducted, indicated quite clearly that the matter had been previously considered by the court; they seemed to know that we would not submit to the fine. On several occasions, I have discussed our position and attitude in regard to Sunday laws, union of Church and State, etc., with the lawyer who attends to our legal affairs; and it is quite evident that he has talked with the authorities about our work and position.

This lawyer did all he could to persuade us not to withstand the authorities, as this would in his opinion lead to endless and incurable difficulties. He said, "You are known as quiet, law-abiding people, and have a good name; but if you rebel against the authorities, you will soon destroy your good name and the esteem which you now enjoy." I replied that our good name depended more upon our obeying God than man; and that if the city of Basle punished us with fines for keeping the commandments of God, it would thereby hurt its good name more than ours. If the facts were made known, we were sure that many could see that such a course was nothing but religious persecution; and we should by no means leave our printing-office to lie idle, but should use it to circulate the facts. To this he replied, "It's a fatal affair."

Quite recently, our lawyer has been appointed as one of the judges; hence he may yet have to sit on our case. Thus, at least one of the judges will have a knowledge of our position. In a recent conversation, he seemed quite desirous to learn more about how Sunday supplanted the Sabbath, and stated that he would have to read up on the question. I shall take pains to supply him with reading. Like nearly all the Swiss of education, he is able to read the English. Last week he went to Bern, the capital, on business, and took occasion to speak with one of the judges of the supreme court about our position. From the conversation, the lawyer gathered that there was little hope of succeeding by appealing to the supreme court.

Religious freedom is guaranteed by the federal constitution; but there are already several decisions of the supreme court on record to the end that Sunday laws do not infringe the rights of conscience.

The police court confirmed our fine, and in case we do not carry it to the supreme court, and gain a favorable decision, we will be held to pay the fine. Sixty days' time is allowed, after which the fine will be collected by sheriff's sale, if not willingly paid before. The notice states twenty francs' fine, or in case of inability to pay, four days' imprisonment; we shall certainly not voluntarily pay the fine, for thereby we should assent to it as just. We do not yet know what course will be pursued in our case, but as we have means, it is quite likely that they will collect the fine by force.

Some of our brethren in Basle and vicinity have ceased to send their children to school on the Sabbath. For this, one has already been called before the police court. He was kindly treated and given an opportunity to give the reasons for not sending his children. The judge imposed the lowest fine possible, two francs (about forty cents), and advised him to send his children to a private school. A report of the case appeared next day in the dailies. The leading one stated that, now that the difficulties with the Salvation Army are past, the waters are troubled by the Adventists, who in their zeal refuse to submit to the school-law by not sending their children to school on Saturday. The judge fined the man, and told him that the Bible was no more to be taken literally, but that he should go to the city officials to learn its meaning!

To avoid difficulties, two families of our people have moved to the canton of Baselland, where the school-law grants six half days of absence per month. As school holds only till Saturday noon, making but four half days' school on the Sabbath per month, our people can here readily avoid sending their children on the Sabbath, without infringing the law. But, to their surprise, they met the same difficulty here as elsewhere, the authorities refusing to excuse the children, holding that the law was not made for any such purpose. The parents were cited to appear before the city council. Brother Erzenberger, the first called, was treated very disrespectfully, but he responded kindly, and gave them some solid truths to think about. The second called was treated more favorably. The brethren appealed first to the law of God, and secondly to the law of the canton. The cases have not yet been finally disposed of; but the teachers show their ill-will in maltreating the children, in making fun of their religion before the school, and by whipping them with scarcely any pretext.

In one of the Catholic cantons, a brother was fined six francs for Sunday work. He refused to pay the fine, and allowed the case to go up higher. Recently his case was heard before the district court of the canton, which confirmed the fine; it will next go to the supreme court of the canton, then to the supreme court of the federation, and lastly to the legislative assembly, in case the decision of the lower courts is not reversed before.

Thus, at the present, five cases are pending,—two for Sunday work, and three for refusing to send children to school on the Sabbath. We can expect nothing else than serious difficulties; but we know that the Master, whose cause it is, can guide in all to his glory and the advancement of the truth.—H. P. Holser, in Review and Herald.
