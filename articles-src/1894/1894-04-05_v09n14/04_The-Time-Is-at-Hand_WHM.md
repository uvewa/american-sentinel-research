The Washington Post, of March 26, contains this report of a late address by a somewhat noted spiritualistic speaker and teacher:—

"He is not here, but risen," began Mrs. Cora L. V. Richmond, at Metzerott Hall yesterday morning, in her lecture on "The Resurrection Morn is the Light of Spiritualism." Continuing, Mrs. Richmond in part said: "Whatever frees man from the fear of death and that which comes after death, is the resurrection. I quote from the words of an eminent Unitarian who said four years ago in his Easter sermon, 'Spiritualism is the only religion or philosophy in the world to-day that makes a celebration of Easter possible; that which reveals immortality without a creed or dogma is Spiritualism.'"

"One earnest minister in the assemblage of the Episcopal congregation said about fifteen years ago: 'The time is coming when the Church will need the evidence that Spiritualism offers to prove the foundations of immortality.' That time is here. When Bishop Young strictly put aside theological sermons and went to preaching concerning the fraternity of man, he knew it. When Newton, in New York, laid aside pomp and formality and preached more of the spiritual fervor of love and immortality, he knew it. When Minot J. Savage, on the borders of materialism, saw skirting around the church over which he held charge the fear of annihilation, he straightway said, 'If Spiritualism does not prove a future existence, there is no proof of it in the world.' That is what we mean to-day, that in the light of a living testimony, the spiritual manifestation is the light of the resurrection. Nothing that dies can be resurrected again, and in Spiritualism there is no resurrection, because there is no death. The body which dies changes its essential conditions, and science declares that atoms reappear. In the change called death the resurrection is already accomplished.

"To-day you celebrate not that which has been built upon the rare spiritual manifestations at the sepulchre and tomb of Jesus, but that which has been demonstrated in your own lives and hearts, and from the door of every sepulchre, from the tomb of every buried casket, from the heart pangs of every one who has mourned, Spiritualism rolls away the stone of sorrow and the shadow of death and says: Never, for one instant of time, not for the slightest thousand millionth part of a moment has the spirit that you loved been dead, but when dust was shaken off and became dust, when the body, by slow degrees, tortured by pain, was cast aside, and before there was time to say, 'My beloved one is gone,' that loved one was away, alive, arisen, freed from the dust, the shackles shaken off, and trying to make you know it.

"Spiritualism has kindled the lights of religion and the sermons of to-day are all pervaded with somewhat of this light which has given them a new tongue of eloquence, which has given them a greater certainty of immortality and it makes more plain the victory over death. If there is a death, all that is meant in that word is the human state—dead in darkness, in striving, in passion, in corruption of earthliness. The glorious inheritance of life is not to be denied or taken away from any soul in the kingdom of God's country.

Certainly, the time has come, or if not is very near at hand, for the coalition of apostate Protestantism, Roman Catholicism, and Spiritualism. The delusions of Spiritualism are absolutely necessary to the maintenance of the system of religious error which Romanism has built up and from which Protestantism, now so-called, does not dissent. The very next act in the drama of false religion will be the open acceptance of these false lights which Spiritualism has kindled on the shores of eternity, and by which those, who accept and follow the traditions of men and the deceits of the evil one, rather than the pure word of God, will be drawn to eternal shipwreck. The statements of this speaker as to the dependence of the popular religionists of the day upon Spiritualism are founded in fact. It is true also that the time for the acknowledgment of the alliance is at hand. It has long been tacitly realized. The doctrine of natural immortality, the adoration of canonized saints and martyrs, and Spiritualism, are interdependent, without the first the other two must necessarily fall, and they all three mutually support one another. They are natural allies. They are necessary each to the other. The exponents of this great and fatal delusion see themselves that the hour is at hand when the union of all its advocates is to take place for the last great deception.
