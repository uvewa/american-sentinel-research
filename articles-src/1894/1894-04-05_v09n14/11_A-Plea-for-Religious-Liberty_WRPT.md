[This article is from the Florida Baptist Witness, Ocala, Fla., February 7, 1894.]

AN article in the Witness of January 3 is entitled to the commendation and gratitude of all friends of religious liberty. It is styled, "Persecuting Adventists," and is an earnest and well-timed protest against the indictment and conviction recently, in the courts of Maryland, of certain Seventh-day Adventists for Sunday work. It is, as you say, an interference with the exercise of their religious liberties, such liberties as are specially and positively guaranteed in both the Federal and State constitutions, under which the citizens live. It is an outrage that ought to elicit the most earnest protest from all professors of the Christian religion particularly. And this not because they are more interested personally than others, on the ground that if religious persecution is tolerated in one instance it may be in others, and only those who worship according to the State plan are exempt; but all professing Christians may plant their opposition on infinitely higher ground, however legitimate this may be. The religion they profess, the religion of the Lord Jesus, is a religion of love, and not one of hatred and force, or one of persecution. It is founded upon the sacred edicts, "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you," and "Love thy neighbor as thyself." We know that there can be none of this in the law nor in those who would enforce it, who would settle the differences of opinion that prevail upon the Sabbath or any other religious question, by fines and imprisonment. Why not settle the question of the mode of baptism by the same arbitrament? Our Methodist brethren think it a great offense to public decency to immerse, and there is as much civil reason in their view of the case to have this mooted question of religious import settled by legislative enactment as there is in favor of a Sabbath or Sunday law.

Let us rise up as one man against this thing. Our religious liberties are at issue in the matter. The religion we profess calls for protest against so unchristian and inhuman a thing. But our protest is not confined to Maryland. A case of the same kind is now pending before the Supreme Court of Tennessee, and two men are soon to be tried at Gainesville, Ga., for the same offense. Is the proud escutcheon of our liberty-loving country to be thus disfigured and dishonored?

Before Christians consent to this wicked thing—surely none doubt that religious persecution of any sort is wicked—let them be fully convinced that where the civil power is thus invoked to interfere in matters of conscience or religious conviction, that there is Bible authority for the thing they would set up by its exercise. The opinion is here ventured that no advocate of Sunday holiness can be found to debate with any Sabbath-keeper as to which is the day. The writer, though not at all in sympathy with seventh-day Christians in any of their tenets, would not shirk a meeting with any Sunday advocate as to any sort of holiness belonging to that day.

The condition of things in Georgia is fearful to contemplate. The two Adventists to be tried are almost sure, if convicted, to be sentenced to work in the chain-gang on the public highways. When it comes to working on Saturday, their Sabbath, they will die before they will do it. Under the laws of Georgia, to thus refuse to work is mutiny, and they are liable to be shot down on the spot.
