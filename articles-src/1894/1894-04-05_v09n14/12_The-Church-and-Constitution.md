The attempt of certain ministers to secure an amendment to the Constitution by which that instrument will be given a religious tone is questionable in wisdom. Their desire is to have inserted this or some similar phrase, "In God's appointed way through Jesus Christ," with a purpose to have the Constitution recognize the influence of the Christian faith in government. A great deal might be said in support of the proposition in a purely religious way, but the precedent of giving to this instrument any religious significance whatever might justify proceedings in future that would give a distinct denominational drift to a principle of nationalism, the virtue of which now is that it gives equal shelter and security and equality to all religious sentiment and belief.

It surely cannot be contended that the introduction of the name of God into the Constitution would tend to the better establishment of religion, for such a contention would be equivalent to the admission that religion needs a constitutional recognition and support. It should not be contended either that the Christian faith requires any such bulwark, for that would be to admit the dependence of the Christian faith for its life and propagation upon legislative provisions, a confession of weakness that the Christian Church should be slow to make. The zeal that attempts now, at this late day, to change the national basis from a purely secular to a constructively religious character reflects more credit upon the spiritual enthusiasm than upon the patriotic judgment of those who are actuated by it.

The Church should not seek reinforcement from the Government. The wisdom of the fathers of the Republic in making a distinct separation of Church and State was the result of experiences with a contrary state of affairs, and their determination to avoid, in the new experiment of government, the conditions that had been productive of so much friction and so many evils in the government from which they had divorced this country should not now be lightly estimated, the more particularly when there is something of a religious contention impending.

If the Constitution may be amended to take account of the Christian faith or church, why may it not with equal propriety be appended in some future time to recognize, specifically, some branch or division of the Christian Church? If now may be inserted the phrase, "In God's appointed way through Jesus Christ," after a time there may be a future amendment so that the declaration shall read: "In God's appointed way through Jesus Christ and his vice-regent on earth, the holy Roman pontiff." It is a dangerous thing our zealous preachers propose, and our legislators in Congress should be made to understand that the sentiment of the American people is opposed emphatically to any religious interference whatever with a Constitution, the great glory of which is its absolute equity toward all humanity irrespective of race or creed or lack of creed.—The Inter Ocean.
