The history of Joseph illustrates that of Christ. Joseph's brothers envied and hated and sold him into slavery, because he was more worthy and their father loved him better than them; for the same reasons the Jews hated and delivered Christ to death. Joseph's steadfast uprightness in his humiliation was the means of his exaltation; so with our Saviour. "We behold Jesus . . . because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor." Heb. 2:9, R. V. Joseph became "lord of all Egypt." "The Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath," enthroned in the midst of the Decalogue. As the Egyptians were obliged to submit to the authority of Joseph, so all who come to Christ must accept the entire law of God, from which he is inseparable. Said the psalmist of Christ, "Thy law is within my heart," they must come submitting their wills to the will of God, which is his law. "I delight to do thy will, O my God; yea thy law is within my heart." Ps. 40:8, 9.

Joseph had made provision during the seven years of plenty so that he had an abundance with which to preserve life during the years of famine, not alone for the Egyptians, but for all the world, for all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy corn. "To Joseph was especially given power that he might save his father's house." Gen. 45. Christ is "the Saviour of all men, specially of those who believe." 1 Tim. 4:10. Jesus made abundant provision for the salvation of all who would come to him. The Sabbath as a reminder of creation, assures us that he who is its Lord, having creative power, he who gave himself for us and to us, while possessing this power, is well able to sanctify and save us. Eze. 20:12.

Joseph's brothers were very dear to him; their lives were the reward of his days and years of bitter trial. He freely, fully forgave them, gave them the best of the land of Egypt and nourished them all the days of their lives. The subjects of his grace are as much dearer to the heart of our precious Saviour as his sufferings for them exceeded Joseph's. They represent the reward of his mediatorial work, his labor of love, and are valued by him in the light of eternal salvation. He "forgives all their sins" "cleanses them from all unrighteousness" and "it is his good pleasure to give them the kingdom."

Joseph was honored, obeyed and loved by his brethren. Thus it is with Jesus and will be forever increasingly so, in as much greater degree as the infinite exceeds the finite. The people could procure food of no one but Joseph; Christ alone has the bread of eternal life which is himself: "The bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world." John 6. Joseph, lord of Egypt, dealing out bread to the people fifty represents Christ, Lord of the Sabbath, doing the same. For bread the Egyptians gave all they had, first their property, then themselves. Christ is "the pearl of great price," and he who would possess it must give all for it.

Joseph bought for Pharaoh all the lands and people of Egypt. Christ will redeem the earth unto God, saved from all the effects of the curse and peopled with the holy, happy, immortal nations of the saved. Rev. 21.

To Joseph was given Pharaoh's ring. "This signet-ring was used for signing public documents and its impression was more valid than the sign-manual of the King."—Jamieson. The Sabbath, as seal of the law of God, is the sign of Christ's authority. The Sabbath is the sign of creative power, as we have learned from the Bible; God alone has this power. Since Christ is Lord of the Sabbath, he has all the power represented by the Sabbath, and therefore is God. He who would abolish or change the creation Sabbath day, robs our Saviour of the great proof of his divinity. Well may the question come home to us: "Will a man rob God?" Is not robbing God as heinous a crime now as it ever was? He has pronounced the judgment, "Ye are cursed with a curse for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation." Mal. 3:9.

"The Sabbath was made for man." Mark 2:27. Did Christ conclude, Wherefore man is lord of the Sabbath? "Knowing what was in man" he neither committed himself nor his precious Sabbath to man. "The Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath." He who presumes to touch any of its divine appointments is meddling with that which Christ has reserved wholly to himself and he betrays an irreverence or carelessness most astonishing and deplorable. He commits a sin like that of Nsdab and Abihu who disregarded the order of the Lord, putting no difference between the common and the holy, and God destroyed them. The Lord did not take the first day of the week of which to make his Sabbath. Sunday was a common work day; it has just the nature of every other work day; while the very nature of the seventh day of the week God hallowed i.e., made holy; and he commands us all, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy."

M. E. STEWARD.
