## THE SABBATH BLESSING.

The Lord blessed the Sabbath, and it became a rest day for man, a day for spiritual rest. The Lord blessed the seventh day, sanctified the seventh day, hallowed the seventh day. We read in Gen. 12:2 concerning Abram: "And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing." The blessing of God put upon any person or any thing is for the purpose of making that person or that thing a blessing to some one else. That is always so; it is so in Christian experience. The blessing that God gives to us is not exclusively for us, but he designs that, in blessing us, we shall be a blessing to others. Just so when he blessed the seventh day, he designed that the seventh day should be a blessing to others. Wherever Abram went, he was a blessing to the people with whom he was associated. In exactly the same way wherever the Sabbath comes it is a blessing to those who know the Sabbath. Those who were acquainted with Abram were blessed because of their acquaintance with him, because God had blessed him to make him a blessing to others. Those who are acquainted with the Sabbath which God has blessed, share in a blessing because God made it a blessing by putting his blessing upon it. But is it not true that man is blessed upon every day of the week?—Certainly. The record says, "And God blessed them." Gen. 1:28. A blessing was placed upon man at the very beginning, and then God blessed the seventh day. Thus man, already blessed, came to the Sabbath, which had been blessed, and so he enjoyed, and can still enjoy, a double blessing upon the Sabbath.

Now let us see in what that blessing consists. The idea of Sabbath is rest. That is the meaning of the term. Turning to the record in Exodus, thirty-third chapter, we find that Moses requested the Lord not to send him and the people up unless he went with them. So the Lord says, fourteenth verse, "My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest." Who was it that went with the children of Israel?—"And they drank of that spiritual rock that went with them, and that rock was Christ." Whose presence was it, then, that was to give them rest?—It was the presence of Christ. With this agree the words of Christ himself in Matt. 11:28: "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." It does not make any difference when it is, whether it be before the first advent of Christ, or since that time, the presence of Christ gives rest. That is the promise, "I will give you rest." My presence shall go with you and give you rest, and that is the Sabbath idea, rest. It is Christ's presence which gives rest that constitutes the very idea of Sabbath-keeping. It was the presence of Christ in the day that was the special blessing of the day. It is the presence of Christ in the Sabbath that makes it a Sabbath day, a rest day, that is, spiritual rest. When the Saviour invited those to come to him that were weary and heavy laden, and he would give them rest, he did not mean simply physical rest; he meant that they could rest in him. But it is impossible to rest in the Lord unless the Lord rests in us.

But go a little further. Not only is it stated that he rested on that day, and blessed that day, and made it a rest day for man, a time for spiritual refreshing, but it is said that he hallowed the day; that is, that he made that day holy. The very thing that made it a Sabbath, hallowed it, made it holy. And two or three scriptures very familiar will show this plainly. Refer again to the experience of Moses at the burning bush; when the Lord called to him out of the bush, he said, "Draw not nigh hither; put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground." The day before that time the ground around that bush was not particularly holy ground. It is true that God is everywhere; and it is true, in that general sense, that everything is holy as belonging to the Lord, but that particular portion of the earth was no more holy the day before that occurrence than any other particular portion, but just as soon as Christ revealed himself there—as we have already learned that it was Christ at the burning bush—that place became holy because of his presence. So the other event to which attention has been called, in Joshua, the fifth chapter, when the Prince of the host of the Lord appeared to Joshua, he said: "Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy." It seems likely that that was a place where Joshua retired for secret prayer. It is more than likely that he had visited this place before, and no such word had come to him, but here was the personal presence of the Prince of the host of the Lord; Christ himself was there, and the presence of Christ made that ground holy, and Joshua was commanded to loose the shoe from off his foot, because it was holy or hallowed ground. Peter says, in speaking of the transfiguration, the record of which we have in 2 Peter 1:18, "And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount." The mount of transfiguration was called holy because Christ in his divinity was manifested there. We have a very marked illustration of this at the time when the law was rehearsed by Christ on Mount Sinai. Bounds were placed about the mount, and the people could not pass beyond them. That mount previous to that time was not specially distinguished from other mountains in that neighborhood; but when the Lord himself, Jesus Christ, the agent in creation, the agent in redemption, came down there in person, and proclaimed anew to the world the law of God, by his own voice, his presence there made that mount holy. The mount was bounded off by lines that separated it from the other parts of the surrounding country. There was no particular difference between that portion of the country and other portions surrounding it, except this, that on that particular mount Jesus Christ himself descended in person, and his presence made that mount holy. If any one stepped beyond the boundary, into that mount made holy by the presence of Christ, it was certain death to him. Here was a particular portion of the country entirely separate and distinct from the adjacent country. Men could walk about as usual, but when they came to that boundary, they must stop. That was in a special way God's land. To step over the line was to step upon holy ground.

Now, just as the presence of Christ at the burning bush made the ground holy, just as the presence of Christ with Joshua made the ground holy, just as the presence of Christ on Mount Sinai made that ground holy, so the presence of Christ, which constitutes the seventh day a rest day, which makes it a Sabbath, a spiritual rest, makes that day holy. And just as there was a particular portion of the ground made holy in all these other cases, just so there was a particular portion of time made holy. The children of Israel could go about their own pursuits; they could walk about as usual outside of that boundary, but the one who treated that mount, thus marked off, the same as he treated other portions of the surrounding country, forfeited his life.

It is none the less true to-day that the presence of Jesus Christ has made holy a particular portion of time, the seventh day, the Sabbath, and so the Scripture says: "If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day." Isa. 58:13. It is none the less true that man may go about as usual, may attend to his usual avocations on six days of the week, but when he comes to that boundary line which marks off the time that Christ has made holy by his own presence in it, if he knowingly steps over that line, and treats that time just as he treats the other time, he does it at the risk of his own life. It is true that "because sentence against an evil work is not speedily executed, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil," but this does not lessen the force of the conclusion. The Lord has indicated his mind in this matter, and he will "give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings."

It is the presence of Christ that makes holy, and his presence has been put into a particular portion of time in a special manner, and that portion of time has been bounded off, separate and distinct from other portions of time. When the children of Israel came up to the boundary of Sinai, they knew it. God did not leave them in ignorance of the boundary line between the common and the sacred. God has not left us in ignorance. He has appointed means that we may know when we come up to that portion of time which he has made holy by his own presence in it, and by his own blessing upon it. But just as the presence of Christ at Sinai made that mount holy, just as his presence in the Sabbath makes that holy, just so the presence of Christ in the individual makes him holy. The Sabbath was designed as a constant reminder of the work of God through Christ in redemption. Without holiness no man shall see the Lord. We are commanded, "Be ye holy, for I am holy." But we cannot make ourselves holy. There is one thing that always makes holy, and that is the presence of Jesus Christ. When Christ dwells in our hearts by faith, we are made holy by his presence, and this is the blessing of Sabbath-keeping. That is Christian experience; that is the Christian life. When Christ dwells in the heart by faith, he by his presence makes the believer holy.

## DOUBLE BLESSING ON THE SABBATH.

But is it not true that we have the blessing of God and the presence of Christ on other days besides the Sabbath day?—Most certainly it is. But there is a difference between the blessing of God upon man and the blessing of God upon the day. In the beginning, speaking of the creation of man, the Word says, "And God blessed them." When it came to the seventh day, and God in Christ rested from his work, he then blessed the seventh day. Now, there is the blessing upon man, and that blessing has continued for every one who will receive it until the present time; there is the blessing upon the day, and that blessing has continued upon that day, and is there now.

But God in Christ never blessed any other day. He blesses man upon every day, but he has blessed only one day, and that is the seventh day. So when man, upon whom the blessing of God already rests, comes to the seventh day, upon which a blessing rests, there are two blessings, and both of them for man; and so it is possible upon the seventh day of the week to enjoy a blessing which cannot be enjoyed upon any other day because it is not there. When the Sabbath goes by us, the Sabbath blessing goes along with it. God's blessing is still with us upon the first day of the week, his blessing remains upon us wherever we go, his blessing remains upon the Sabbath wherever it goes; and when it comes around to us again, the blessing is still upon it, and it has a blessing in addition to the blessing that God has given us. This is the blessing of the Sabbath; this is the blessing of Sabbath-keeping.

But not only is it said that God in Christ blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it, but he sanctified it. Notice what it is that sanctifies. "And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory." Ex. 29:43. What is it that sanctifies?—It is the presence, the glory of God in Christ. And just as God dwelling in the tabernacle sanctified it, so Christ in the believer sanctifies him.

## THE SABBATH A SIGN OF SANCTIFICATION.

Now read Ezek. 20:12: "Moreover also I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them." Or, as another translation reads, "I am Jehovah, their sanctifier." And in connection with that read Ex. 31:13: "Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my Sabbaths ye shall keep; for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you." Another translation gives that clause in this way: "I, Jehovah, am sanctifying you." Now, of what is the Sabbath to be a sign to us as it comes week after week?—It is to be a sign that "I, Jehovah, am sanctifying you," and every succeeding Sabbath marks the progress of that work of sanctification. We receive the blessing of God on one Sabbath; the next one comes, and if we have been growing in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, the blessing of the next Sabbath is an added blessing. It teaches us more and more of the power of God in creation and in redemption. We add to our experience, and it is a sign continually, "I, Jehovah, am sanctifying you," making you holy. Thus it appears again that the blessing of the Sabbath is the blessing of sanctification.
