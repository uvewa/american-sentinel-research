ISAAC BAKER and Milton Bryan, the Seventh-day Adventists imprisoned in Queen Anne's County, Md., for Sunday work, were released on the 23rd ult. We were misinformed as to the release of Mr. Bryan at a previous date. The technical sentence was "until the fines and costs" should be paid. As neither the fines nor costs were paid a formal order of release was necessary; and as no judge could be found to sign it, they remained in jail more than the usual thirty days required in such cases.
