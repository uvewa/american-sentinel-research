The equality of all men is a fundamental principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Not that all men are equal physically or intellectually or even morally; but they are equal in that they all stand on a common footing in their relation to their Creator. God is no respecter of persons. They are equal in that they all have the same rights; for rights are God-given. God gave his Son to die for all men, that whosoever believeth in him might not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16. All souls are of equal value in his sight. He paid the same price for one that he did for another.

But while God is no respecter of persons, we find that man, whom he has created, is a respecter of persons. The Majesty of heaven, the Creator and Upholder of all worlds, treats with equal regard the most humble and the most exalted of our race; but puny, finite man presumes to make a distinction among his fellows, and even those who profess to be his followers are often not behind the rest in ignoring the rights of those whom fortune has surrounded with the least favorable circumstances of birth, education, or nationality.

The Matabele savage, for example, although it is his fortune to be born into surroundings and circumstances which cause him to grow up an ignorant, uncivilized denizen of his native wilds, is none the less for that a member of the human family, and possessed of those rights which are inherent in every man by birth. In his relation to God, he stands upon the same footing as that of his more fortunate fellows in civilized lands. God has no more respect to the person of one than of the other. He gave his Son to die for both alike. And the power of divine grace will work the same transformation in both, and fit both alike for the inheritance of the children of faith. The body of the ignorant savage, no less than that of his enlightened, civilized brother, may become the temple of the Holy Spirit. Yet the latter presumes to deal with the former as if God had given him no rights whatever, and as if his standing, in the sight of God, was entirely different from his own. He invades his country, despoils him of his property, kills him if he tries to prevent it, and divides his territory and portions it out among the victors, with no more thought of its native possessors and their rights than as though they were but "the cattle upon a thousand hills." And he does all this in the name of justice; yes, even sometimes in the name of Christianity.

But the principle which actuates him in such work is the very opposite of Christianity. Christianity is unselfish. It makes a man the servant, not the master, of his fellows. It does not prompt a man, when he beholds some wrong, to commit a greater wrong in order to make it right; but it prompts him to go to the wrong doer, not with rifles and Maxim guns, but with the spirit of Christ, and endeavor to reclaim him from the evil into which he has fallen. It does not palliate a wrong because it is done to one who happens to be uncivilized. It teaches the brotherhood of man, and that each man is his brother's keeper. It puts him under obligation to both Jew and Gentile, not to override and rob and slay the latter, but to bring to him the glad tidings of that gospel which is the power of God unto salvation.

Paul, the great apostle to the Gentiles, and one of the most illustrious followers of Jesus Christ, has left on record for us his own view of himself by declaring himself to be "less than the least of all saints," and "nothing." Eph. 3:8; 2 Cor. 12:11. This is the view which every Christian will have of himself when he is living as near to his Lord as was the Apostle Paul. And this is the secret of the realization of equality among them. This is the only way in which it can ever come. When each one sees himself to be the least of all, no one will put himself above any of his fellows, no matter what may be their race, color, or the misfortunes which have dragged them down.

Let it be understood, therefore, that nothing that is not done for the welfare of those who are its recipients, is prompted by the spirit of Christianity, or should have the sanction of Christian men and women.
