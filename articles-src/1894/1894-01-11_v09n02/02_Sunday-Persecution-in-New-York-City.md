SUNDAY persecution is not by any means unknown to New York City, as shown by the number of Sunday arrests made for ordinary labor and for selling goods on Sunday during the past year. The Evening World, of Dec. 18, contained the following:

Justice Voorhis, in the Essex Market Police Court, to-day, held the following store-keepers for trial, on a charge of having violated the Sunday law:

Nathan Goldman, of 51 Canal Street; Simon Slofsky, 73 Hester St.; Simon Leimson, 35 Essex St.; Samuel Taylor, 48 Hester St.; Abraham Weipner, 27 Hester St.; Nathan Greenburg, 84 Ludlow St.; Isaac Schwartzer, 18 Essex St.; Samuel Baffel, 75 Hester St.; Samuel Spiegelglass, 32 Hester St.; Hayman Denowitz, 6 Clinton St.; Louis Kontaky, 34 Orchard St.; and Meyer Flecker, 148 Livingston St. All of the men arrested are Hebrews, and they claimed that they observed Saturday as their Sabbath, and considered themselves entitled to open up their business and sell goods as long as they did not annoy their neighbors.

A policeman attached to the Eldridge Street Station arraigned a Grand Street jeweler because he displayed his wares in the window. Justice Voorhis remarked that he did not know that displaying goods in a show-window was an offense and discharged the jeweler.

The World, of Dec. 21, publishes this communication, which refers to the arrests of that same day:

To the Editor of the World:

What next! Is this a monarchy or a republic? I happened to be obliged to call on a party in Hester Street yesterday (Sunday), and did so with difficulty, for the police had given orders that after 10 o'clock a. m. the stores had to be closed, and I might be looked upon as a customer and the proprietor was liable to be arrested. Great Scott! In Connecticut and Rhode Island the Seventh-day Baptists worship on Saturday the same as the Jews do here, and on Sunday the mills are running, the stores are open, and no one interferes. Now, in the name of common sense, who gives the police this authority, unconstitutional as it is? Dear sir, can you explain this and give those hard-working people advice to whom to appeal, so that they, being closed on Saturday, can have six working days as well as other religionists?

H. C. KLOPPENBURG.

New York, Dec. 18.

The number of Sunday arrests in the city of New York, solely from a spirit of persecution, increased rapidly in the last few months of 1893. What will be the development of the enforcement of religious law in 1894?
