THE Patriotic American, a new American Protective Association paper, has been launched on the tempestuous sea of polemic journalism at Camden, N. J. It is published by the Patriotic Tract Society, and its editor is John H. Buckley. Judging by the initial number, the Patriotic American is destined to wield considerable influence wherever it circulates. So far as it shall do battle for correct principles and upon correct principles we wish it success.
