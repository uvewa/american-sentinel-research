THE Leroy Journal, of Leroy, Ill., prints the following item:—

A well-known Advent woman, residing in this vicinity, spent last Sunday sewing and doing other work which should have been done week-days instead of the desecration of the Sabbath of our Lord. Such a vile sin as this should not be tolerated in a Christian community.

Were it not that the law of Illinois is more tolerant than the Leroy Journal and its paragraphers, it is evident that this dreadful "Advent woman" would soon be behind prison bars.
