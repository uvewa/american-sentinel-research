WE have made an effort to obtain a supply of the numbers of the Catholic Mirror in which the articles on the "Christian Sabbath," recently republished by us, appeared, but are informed that the desired numbers have been entirely exhausted. The Mirror has, however, issued the same matter in pamphlet form, 50 pages, price, ten cents. We have secured a supply of these pamphlets, and are prepared to fill orders at the publishers' price. If you want this pamphlet, order soon, as probably only a small edition has been printed. The price is somewhat high, but the articles are valuable, as setting forth, authentically, the position of the Catholic Church on the Sabbath question.
