[It will be remembered by our readers, that two or three years ago the American Secular Union put a plank in its platform endorsing Sunday laws for "scientific and economical reasons." This was accomplished under the presidency and leadership of Dr. Westbrook. It will be also remembered how the National Reform combination exulted over this surrender of the Secular Union to their principles. Well, there has been lately a revolution in the Secular Union. Mr. Westbrook has been retired from the presidency, and with him also his Sunday-law plank from the platform of the union. In their late annual convention, Mr. Westbrook offered a paper defending his Sunday-law theory, but the union refused to hear it. It seems that Mr. Westbrook resented this, and like the other National Reformers, charged the union with "anarchy." The rest of the story is well told in the following communication which we have received from Mr. Samuel P. Putnam, which we willingly print, and congratulate the members of the American Secular Union upon this splendid revolution which has cut them loose from the National Reform combination.]

I THINK the officers of the American Secular Union were perfectly justified in not reading the speech of Mr. Westbrook, since it squarely opposed the principles of the union. Did not Westbrook once upon a time call down Charlesworth for the reason that he was going beyond the Nine Demands, though not against them? Where is the intolerance, then, of not reading a speech that is opposed to these demands upon which the union is founded?

The union and federation are opposed, and all true Liberals must be opposed, to any kind of Sabbath or Sunday laws. We want no laws on the subject whatsoever, any more than we want laws to regulate our sleeping, or our eating, or our drinking. This is not anarchy, as Mr. Westbrook charges. It is simply the democracy of Paine and Jefferson, of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States. It is simply the rights of man. Can't Dr. Westbrook see that if the government has a right to enforce a secular Sunday, it has the same right to enforce a religious Sunday? It then becomes not a question of principle, but of the wish of the majority. Does Westbrook mean to maintain that the minority has no rights which the majority is bound to respect? I wish Dr. Westbrook would discuss principles and not wants. No matter what the majority of the people want; the question is what have they a right to enforce by law?

I affirm that as a matter of fact the opening of the World's Fair was in accordance with the wishes of a large majority of the people of the United States, and there is plenty of testimony on this point, given by A. T. Jones in the AMERICAN SENTINEL and our own Freethought journals, and in the public press generally. As a matter of fact there were two million signatures in favor of opening to less than five hundred thousand against it.

But to get at the gist of the argument: I will grant that two thirds of Congress, of the National Commission, of the Local Directory, and of the exhibitors, home and foreign, wanted the Fair closed on Sunday. I will give Westbrook all the majority he desires, and then ask, Would this majority of two to one have any right to close the gates of the World's Fair on Sunday? I answer simply, No; and I challenge Dr. Westbrook to meet me on that point, the question of the right of the matter and not merely the wishes of the people.

I met this question fairly and squarely before the congressional committee, and showed that government had no more right to enforce a holiday than a holy day. I am willing to throw out the whole question of religion—although, practically, it cannot be thrown out—but let the issue be, not the enforcement of a religious day, but of a holiday.

I absolutely deny that government has any right to enforce a holiday. It has no right to command people not to work—in other words, to enforce idleness—for in order to enforce a holiday, the government must enforce idleness. It must say to all the people on this day, "You shall not work; if you work, we shall arrest you; if you work, we shall fine you; we shall put you in prison and in the chain-gang, and send you into exile."

That is the logic of the whole matter, and there could be no greater tyranny in the universe than a law that shall say to the people, on fifty-two days of the year, "You shall not earn your bread, you shall not labor for your families, you shall sit in idleness. Though the corn grows, you shall not hoe it; though the grass waves, you shall not cut it; though the wind sweeps, you shall not set sail with merchandise; you can take rum and tobacco and go on a jamboree, but you shall not work; you are compelled by law to enjoy yourselves, but if you labor, then you commit a crime." All business and traffic must be stopped. Only excursion trains can run on Sundays. There may be picnics and church fairs, and kissing bees, . . . there may be all sorts of pleasure parties but no toil. No matter how much a man needs work, he must not do it. The State stands over him with a whiplash, and says, "Now if you don't quit work and go to play I'll lick you."

That is the position of Westbrook, and it is more nonsensical than the position of the Church itself—a position that grants everything that the Church desires; a position that would make human society rotten to the core; a position as dark and terrible in its consequences as the logic of the Inquisition; a position that necessarily violates the conscience, the rights, the freedom, of every one in the land who voluntarily keeps Saturday as a day of rest, compelling him to keep involuntarily another day at an expense of hundreds of dollars a year.

Will Dr. Westbrook meet this question fairly? Put the religious aspect entirely aside, ignore utterly the existence of the Church, take it as a matter of purely secular legislation, and I will show that Dr. Westbrook is a tyrant, and that his so-called "secular Sunday," enforced by law, is at heart as cruel, unjust, and destructive of all right as the "religious Sabbath." They have different names and different aspects, but at heart they are the same despotism. To say that the wishes of a majority are to be the source of all law is all that the Church has ever claimed of secular authority, for no church has ever been in favor of religious legislation when in the minority. But grant this principle—that the majority can do as it wishes with no regard to the rights of the minority—and the foundation of every claim of the Church is established.

But even if there were no church to take advantage of this principle, what an atrocious assumption it is, anyway; and in this particular matter of Sunday legislation, what an exasperating infringement of human rights! The idea of a government saying to the people, "You shall not work, you shall be idle. Play, if you will, but if you do any labor you shall be fined, imprisoned, and harnessed with the vilest criminals—the murderer, the thief, the ravisher—for by our 'secular Sunday laws' you are equally criminal with them and deserving of punishment." That is the logic of Westbrook. Where is the difference between it and all the outrageous persecutions of the past?
