MORE than eighteen hundred years ago the divine Saviour of men, in foretelling the signs that should precede the close of human probation and his second coming, said (Luke 21:25, 26) that there should be "upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth." Have not these words been remarkably fulfilled during the year just closed by almost innumerable disasters on sea and land, and by world wide financial disaster without any adequate or assignable cause? And is not the following extract from the New York World, of January 4, a most significant commentary upon the latter part of the text quoted?

Europe is restless and apprehensive. It is not the shadow of the man on horseback nor the quarrels of the nations snarling at each other's heels that worry England and fill the continent with dread. It is something mysterious, deadly, threatening, that causes the great powers to forget for a moment their jealousies and rivalries and to unite in a great crusade against the stealthy foe that threatens the very groundwork of modern society. The drilling of great armies is checked for a time, while the police search nook and corner for the hidden bomb.

The word of the Lord is: "Behold the fig-tree, and all the trees; when they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand. So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand. Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled." Shall we not heed the warning?
