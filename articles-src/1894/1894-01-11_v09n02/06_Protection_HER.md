In the early days of the United States Government it was thought wise to protect the infant industries of the nation from the rivalry of other powers. Laws were formed to compel the foreign manufacturer to pay a heavy duty or tariff on all articles brought into the country which could be made here. Free trade was not allowed. No one claims that this is doing as we like to be done by, but it has been justified on the ground of expediency. Political parties are now contending over the policy purely as a selfish matter. They do not go into ethics very deeply, but each side claims to advocate the matter in the way to enrich the American citizen. One thing is certain, many of the "infants" have grown remarkably strong, and as huge monopolies have become a menace to the maternal breast. Frantic efforts are now made to break the bands, but it is too late. Political ruin is the price any party must pay that makes the attempt, and the whole nation will suffer with it. This is the situation to-day. Money is plenty in the banks, crops are abundant, men are eager to work, but the "infant" declares that the factory will be closed till he is assured of his protection.

In religious matters a similar condition exists. Laws were early made to protect American piety. Especially was the "American Sabbath" an "infant" to be carefully watched and fed. Its free trade rivals are the so-called "Jewish Sabbath" and the "continental Sunday." Restrictive laws against these were made. He who would observe the Jewish Sabbath must pay a duty of 100 per cent. of its value, or 16⅔ per cent. of his entire capital in time. The "continental Sunday" was not uniformly taxed. Sometimes it came in free through neglect of the custom house authorities; at others it had to pay heavy damages. But how about the "infant"? Oh! that has grown very large and wears No. 12 boots. It has become the hugest monopoly of the age. Even those who once nursed it are afraid its antics will bring disgrace upon them. They are reminded that if the bottle is not promptly filled they will not get back to Congress. The "infant" is cross. He wants feeding, and he wants it quick. He don't know enough to reason, and he will yell while you try to soothe him. Such is the great "American Sabbath" that this nation has adopted.

Uncle Sam might better have remained an old bachelor than to have accepted the apostate Church and the care of this infant. But it is too late. "Give!" "Give!" is the constant cry of mother and child. More protection for Sunday is demanded, even though men go to jail rather than become food for its ravenous stomach. Call out the troops, ring for the policeman, run for the constable, the infant religion is out in uniform and must not be trifled with. Never mind the people, but protect the great "American Sabbath."

H. E. ROBINSON.
