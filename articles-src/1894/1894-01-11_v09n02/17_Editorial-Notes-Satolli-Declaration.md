ABLEGATE SATOLLI has declared that "what Rome has done for other countries she will do for the United States." Not a bit of doubt of it; it is just what we have dreaded all the while; but it does seem to be inevitable. Spain, Italy, and Mexico, are awful examples of what Rome has done for other countries; and now she pledges herself to do the same here! And yet the people will not be aroused to their danger; and men calling themselves Protestants gladly join hands with papists in their iniquitous work!
