THE Independent, of this city, has this concerning the persecution of Adventists in Maryland:—

The Signs of the Times, a Seventh-day Adventist paper, wants to know what we think of the fact that three men should now be lying in jail in the Commonwealth of Maryland for "doing bodily labor on Sunday" in obedience to the dictates of their own conscience and their religious faith—one of them having been discovered plowing in his own field, a second setting out tomato plants in his own garden, and a third chopping wood at his own door. We answer that if it be true, as our contemporary tells us, that these were men who conscientiously observed the seventh day as their Sabbath, and who, in doing this work, disturbed nobody else, and were discovered at it only by persons spying out for the purpose of inquisition, then it is an outrageous injustice, an offense against freedom of worship, and ought not to be allowed by the laws of a reputable State.

This is well as far as it goes; but why must one be conscientious before being permitted to labor on Sunday? Why prohibit voluntary labor on Sunday more than on other days? If the day must be recognized by the law as differing from other days, why put it on a basis different from Thanksgiving day, Christmas, or the Fourth of July? These are in law simply dies non. This is as far as civil authority has any right to go; and it is as far as civil rights demand that it shall go. Nobody demands that before one be permitted to work on the Fourth of July he shall have patriotically observed another day. No legislature would think of enacting a law that everybody must feast upon Thanksgiving, except such as shall be able to prove that they have eaten turkey and cranberry sauce the previous day. Nobody ever heard of a law requiring everybody to make gifts on Christmas, except such as have given each of their children a present upon their respective birthdays. In short, no holiday except Sunday is hedged about with statutes forbidding labor or amusement; and the only possible reason why Sunday should be an exception is its religious character, and the mistaken and mischievous notion that it is the duty of civil government to legislate in behalf of ecclesiastical institutions. The whole idea is radically wrong and pernicious.
