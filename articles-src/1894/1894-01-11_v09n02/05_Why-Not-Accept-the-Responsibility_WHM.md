THE Independent, of Dec. 28, in its editorial résumé of "The Year Among the Churches," has this paragraph:—

The controversy over Sunday opening, in connection with the World's Fair, which had been going on during the previous year, became very animated as the time for the inauguration of the Fair approached. The Fair authorities dallied with the question, not having finally decided it up to the time that the Fair was opened in May. During the first Sundays of the Exposition the grounds were closed; later they were opened in defiance of the general opposition of the Christian sentiment of the country, and also of the prohibitory action of Congress. The matter got into the courts, both Federal and State. On a technical point, the decision of the Federal Court was given in favor of the managers. From the State courts an injunction was issued to the managers, forbidding them to close the gates on Sunday. In the meantime the managers had ascertained by experience that the public did not care to patronize the Fair on the national rest-day, and that the gates could only be kept open at a loss. Anxious to have the injunction modified so as to permit them to close on Sundays, they found the way to do so curiously blocked. Therefore the Fair was kept open seven days in the week until its close. The experience in this case, however, proves conclusively that the Christian public does not want to have general expositions open on Sunday. The working man, for whom a Sunday Fair was advocated, preferred to preserve the day as a day of rest, and showed no inclination to favor the invasion of his one weekly rest-day.

The Independent is correct enough as to its facts, as far as they are stated, but the experience in this case does not warrant the deductions drawn. In the first place the case is imperfectly stated. The managers did not find that "the public did not care to patronize the Fair" on Sunday, nor that the gates could only be kept open at a loss on that day. The only loss which occurred to the management of the Fair because of Sunday opening was involved in the return of the appropriation which Congress conditioned on Sunday closing. The experience of the comparatively small attendance at the Fair on Sundays did not prove that the "public did not want to have general expositions open on Sunday." The only thing that it proved was that the general public would not attend in large numbers when a considerable proportion of the exhibits were covered and many whole buildings closed. The covering of these exhibits and closing of these buildings, was secured by the influence and concerted action of the American Sabbath Union and its allies, and not from the promptings of the individual conscience of the exhibitors. Why should the writers for the religious press and preachers in the popular pulpits attempt to deceive themselves and their constituency in this thing? They all know that the reduced attendance at the Fair on Sunday was not, on the part of the mass of the people, because of any religious conviction or conscientious sense of duty. The common people went by tens of thousands to other city parks, and out of town resorts, on Sunday, and indulged in much more questionable amusements than attendance at the Fair. Why not acknowledge this openly and accept themselves the responsibility, where it really lies, of having, by skillful devices of politics, influence and boycott, succeeded in keeping the crowds away from the Fair on Sunday?

The result of the contest in regard to the Sunday closing of the World's Fair has proved nothing except the capacity of the representatives of popular religion to secure a semblance of subservience to their creed as regards Sunday from the people, however unwillingly, and that in this the prophecies as regards Sunday, and the influence of the popular churches in developing through false Protestantism a similitude to the papacy, is fast being fulfilled.
