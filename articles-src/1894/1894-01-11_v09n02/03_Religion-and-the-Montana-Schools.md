A DISTRICT school teacher in Montana has insisted on having devotional exercises in school, and to this end required the pupils to bring Bibles and hymn books. A citizen, resident in that school district, complained to the attorney general of the State, and he has rendered a decision in which he holds that in that State the use of the Bible in the public schools is contrary to law. After quoting from the constitution of the State and the school laws, the attorney general says:

Among the framers of the constitution of the State of Montana were Catholics, Jews, and adherents of many Protestant sects, who framed these positive prohibitions against permitting sectarian tenets to be taught in the public schools. The constitution was in this connection framed with the view of protecting those settlers and residents of Montana who came from countries in which a State religion is maintained and enforced, and who have suffered under the disabilities resulting from their rejection of the established religion.

Further on the attorney general says:

It is safe to assert, without fear of contradiction, that the Bible, as an entirety, is the noblest monument of thought, beauty and sublimity, of pathetic narrative and moral teaching, the richest treasury of household words and familiar phrases, of popular illustrations and associations that any language has ever possessed, but the reading of the same in the public schools is a religious exercise, and its use therein is in effect the adoption of it as a text book of the common schools, which is not only inhibited by the constitution, but prohibited by the law. The order made by the school teacher commanding and requiring the pupils of her school, in school district No. 14, to bring their Bibles and hymn books to school for use therein has all the force and effect of adopting the Bible and hymn books as text books in said public school; it therefore brings such books within the prohibitions laid down in the constitution and the school laws of Montana. The constitution of the State of Montana prohibits all religious or partisan tests as a condition of admission into any public educational institution of the State, either as a teacher or student, and likewise prohibits the teaching of sectarian tenets therein. The legislature, in executing these wise and beneficent provisions of the constitution, definitely prescribes the text books that shall be used therein for a period of six years, commencing July, 1889.

If the teacher of school district No. 14 may adopt the Bible as a text book in the public school, it means that sectarian tenets may be taught therein. If this be so, such teachings must be complete and accurate. Complete and accurate teaching of sectarian tenets to a Methodist is the teaching of Methodism, to an Episcopalian of Episcopalianism, to a Catholic of Catholicism, to a Presbyterian of Presbyterianism, to the disciples of Spinoza of Pantheism, of Hume of Deism, and to the Baptist mind it involves immersion. Each religious denomination, sect or creed differs as to the correct version of the Bible, but as to God's omnipotence there is no cavil, for it is seen in life, death, and the world's existence. An honest difference of opinion exists among these doctrinal denominations concerning the books that come within the purview and meaning of the term "Holy Bible." The Jew regards the Old Testament as alone inspired; the Catholic adds the Apocrypha and New Testament, while the Protestant repudiates the Apocrypha. Will the Catholic dispense with the Douay version of the Bible, which is the only one recognized by the Catholic Church as correct, and accept the King James version of the Bible without the Apocrypha?

The provisions of the constitution inhibiting the teaching of sectarian tenets in the public schools are prohibitory, and the declaration in the statutes providing a series of text books are mandatory. As the Bible, the use of which in the public schools by the teacher, has all the force and effect of adopting it as a text book therein, comes within the prohibitory provisions of the constitution and the mandatory provisions of the law, the reading thereof cannot be permitted in our public schools without violating the plain prohibitory terms of the former and the express mandatory provisions of the latter. The fact that the board of trustees refuse to order the teacher to desist from using the Bible in the public schools has the effect to establish a rule adopting it. "Regulations adopted by persons in charge of a school are analogous to by laws enacted by municipal authorities and other corporations, and both will be annulled by the courts when found to be unauthorized, against common right, or palpably unreasonable."

So long as this decision remains fresh in the minds of the people of Montana, it will be difficult to use the public schools as an avenue by which to disseminate religious error. It is not possible, in the nature of things, that the religious teaching of the State should be anything else than error, and Montana is to be congratulated that it has such clear-cut statutes and decisions on the subject.
