"A CHRISTIAN man may believe that his church is far from perfect, and may yet consistently retain his membership in it; but in the very moment in which he reaches the conclusion that it is a thoroughly corrupt organization, he is bound to leave it and lift up his voice against it. If he hesitates, he shows that he is lacking in courage."
