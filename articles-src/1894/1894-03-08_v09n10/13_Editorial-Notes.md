ANY one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.

LEGISLATION seems to be running mad. The latest freak is a bill at Albany "to prohibit the tolling of any bell in any cemetery in Brooklyn." The Sun pertinently enquires: "Will the meddlers with everything, and every custom, and every right of the living and of the dead, even with funerals, burial ceremonies, and immemorial usages, never cease their meddling?"

THE Catholic Review does not like the idea of taxing church property, but thinks that in the event of such a policy being adopted, "it is not the Catholics but the Protestants who will have the most reason to wince." And that is just the reason church property will not be taxed. "Protestants" there are in abundance who would like to tax Romish Church property, but the Protestants who are willing to pay taxes on their own church property are few.

A DISPATCH from Toledo, under date of February 21, published in the Sun of this city, on the 22nd, states that a judgment was rendered against one W. J. Ostrander, on a suit brought to recover a balance of $138.40 on a contract for a lot of rifles sent to Council No. 2 of the American Protective Association. Ostrander was, it seems, the agent of the council in the purchase of the rifles. With the American Protective Association and the Roman Catholics both arming, the results are scarcely a matter of doubt. Open conflict must ensue.

The American Protective Association is opposed to the papacy, and this is right. But this way of opposing the papacy is not right. Rome and her methods are all wrong. And opposition to Rome or her methods cannot be made in the right way, nor can it ever succeed, by doing as she does. That only helps her along, instead of being any real opposition to her.

"The garb of the Sisters of Charity was conspicuous in the Thirty-fourth Ward public school to-day," says a Pittsburg dispatch of the 26th ult. The reason given is that four nuns who had been previously employed in the parochial school of the ward begun teaching in the public school. The priest in charge of the parish states that this was necessary because of lack of accommodations for the parochial school children in his building. Instead of erecting an addition to the parochial school he installed nuns as teachers in the public school. "The nuns passed the school teachers' examinations with high percentages." The school board is composed of Catholics, and they readily agreed to the proposition. It is said that there will be no religious instruction given in the school hours, and that the nuns will not wear their rosaries, but will wear their religious garb. Commenting on the facts stated, the Independent, of this city, says: "Of course a nun should not be excluded from qualifying as a teacher if she can. But we should draw the line at her wearing any specially religious garb: and if we are not mistaken, General Draper, who was superintendent of schools for this State, decided that such a dress could not be allowed in public schools." If General Draper ever made such a ruling he was clearly right. Distinctively religious garbs must be excluded from the public school rooms unless the schools are to be completely Romanized.

A CORRESPONDENT wants to know our objections to the proposed 16th Amendment. We have no objection to it except that it does not go far enough. It prohibits simply appropriations for "sectarian" purposes. In the proper sense of the word that is all right, but in the sense in which it is intended by the promoters of the amendment it would still leave the Government or any State free to make appropriations for that colorless thing known as "unsectarian religious instruction." The amendment does not touch the root of the evil and is not designed to.

TOPEKA, Kansas, is moving in the matter of Sunday closing. The Ways and Means Committee met recently, says the Topeka Capital, to discuss the Sunday closing ordinance. A delegation from the Ministerial Union, consisting of Revs. Alderson, Dill, and Owens, was present to discuss the matter with the members of the committee.

"The points of discussion took a very wide course, which involved Sunday labor in nearly all its phases. This dealt with the butcher, milkman, Sunday paper question, and even the street railway company, and ran so far into the ridiculous that the ministers were compelled to draw the line and confine the discussion to a representative case, that of the butcher.

"The ordinance relating to Sunday closing states that it shall be unlawful to expose to sale fermented liquors, any goods, wares or merchandise excepting drugs, provisions and articles of immediate necessity on Sunday. It was over the expression 'immediate necessity' that the widest opinion existed among the committeemen. Messrs. Holman and Fulton thought it unnecessary to get meat on Sunday, as it could easily be kept if bought on Saturday. Colonel Burgess thought it no worse to buy meat on Sunday than to have his wife wring a chicken's neck and clean it before going to church, while General Bradford thought the butcher shop ought to be kept open for several hours, but not later than 9 o'clock. The latter opinion met with favor and it was finally left to Mr. Bradford to draw up an amendment to ordinance 68, which should specify that butcher shops be kept open for three hours, until 9 o'clock on Sundays, and also naming a $5 minimum fine, which is not contained in the present ordinance."

A FRIEND in Missouri writes us as follows:—

Publishers AMERICAN SENTINEL:

Not being very busy to-day I canvassed a little for the SENTINEL, and the first five men I showed the paper to subscribed; and I herewith send you $4.50, for which you will please send the paper to the following names: [Here are given five names and addresses.]

Our friend need have sent us only four dollars on five new subscriptions, and is therefore entitled to fifty cents credit on his own subscription under our special offer recently made. Other readers of the SENTINEL have been doing the same kind of work, and there is opportunity for still others. Let the good work go on.
