"THERE was a singularly interesting debate last night," says the Westminster (Eng.) Gazette, of February 10, "at a meeting of various guilds at the rooms of the English Church Union on the question of the observance of Sunday. Mr. Stewart Headlam, who came late from the School Board meeting with Mr. Ridgeway, more suo expressed his conviction that every one was in favor of any amount of recreation after attendance at the Holy Communion, an assertion which was loudly challenged; but there was a general consensus of opinion that, while the Sunday was a day of rest, worship, and recreation, it was very wrong for the leisure classes to make so many other people work to minister to their pleasure. In fact, the majority of those present recognized that the sons of toil had a right to an amount of liberty on Sundays which would have shocked a former generation. An extremely interesting and effective speech was made by a laborer in the building trade, who advocated the opening of museums on Sundays, as did Mr. Ridgeway very strongly."
