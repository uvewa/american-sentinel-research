SECRETARY WYLIE of the National Reform Association thus outlines the work to be accomplished by the association to secure the adoption of the proposed "Christian" amendment to the Constitution of the United States:—

1. At least two agents must be kept at Washington to watch the progress of events, to arrange for hearing, and to form the connecting link between the people and the Congress.

2. When the time comes for hearing arguments by the judiciary committee we must send to Washington the best talent in the land to present the strongest pleas possible for the submission of the proposed amendment.

3. When the bill is reported to the two houses we must flood Congress with petitions urging the passage of the bill. Letters and telegrams by the ten thousand should also be sent to individuals, Congressmen and Senators, urging them to vote for the measure.

4. When it is submitted to the conventions in the States for ratification Christian citizens without regard to sect or party should labor to secure the election of good men, who are sure to vote for ratification, as members of the ratifying conventions.

5. Meetings must be held in every city, town, village, hamlet, and country district, to quicken and concentrate the Christian sentiment of our country in favor of this amendment. Petitions must be circulated and signers obtained by the hundred thousand. Every one who can devote a little time, if only a few days or hours, should circulate the petitions for signatures.

6. Literature treating of this measure must be scattered all over the land, East, West, North, and South, so that the whole people may be awakened and enlightened on this the most important measure ever brought before this nation.

It matters little what the National Reformers do. The Supreme Court and Congress have already practically amended (?) the Constitution; but it is of the utmost importance that the people shall be made acquainted everywhere with the real nature of the National Reform movement and the National Reform combination, so that they may refuse to worship the papal beast and his image.
