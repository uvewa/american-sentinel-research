We have been criticised several times for calling the papal church, simply, the "Catholic Church." The following anecdote will serve to illustrate our use of the word "catholic" as applied to a church, which, by her own usage, in calling herself the "Holy Roman Catholic Church," confesses that she is not catholic in the true sense.

There was, many years ago, in the city of Boston, an old colored man, who gained a livelihood in winter by the sale of what he called "hot meat pies." One very cold day a farmer came to town with a load of wood. Thoroughly chilled and feeling that something at once hot and nourishing was just what he needed, and being attracted by the old man's cheery cry of "Hot meat pies," he purchased one; but lo! when he bit into it he discovered that it was frozen. He at once exclaimed, "You rascal, you said this pie was hot!" But the old man was equal to the occasion, and answered, "No boss; I said 'twas a 'hot meat pie.' Dat's the name ob dem, boss. Dat's what I calls 'em, boss." The appellation "Hot meat pies" was simply a name and not a description of the old man's pies. It is even so with the word "catholic," as applied to the Romish church; it does not describe that church; it is simply a name.
