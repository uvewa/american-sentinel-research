"It seems utterly useless," complains the Catholic Standard, "for American Catholics to protest that the charges brought against them by the American Protective Association are calumnies; that Catholics are not disloyal to the Government of the United States," etc. The SENTINEL is not an American Protective Association organ, nor is it in sympathy with the methods of that organization; but it cannot see that any great injustice is done the Catholics, nor is it a misrepresentation to say that Roman Catholics are necessarily disloyal. Not that they are necessarily at the present time in open hostility to the Government, but that the papal system so enthralls its votaries that their highest allegiance is due, not only in religion but in civil duties as well, to the Roman hierarchy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated; but the most recent example is France. There for years the attitude of the papal church was one of hostility to the Government, until only recently the pope bade his minions support the republic. Instantly the whole body of the French Catholics became supporters of the Government. But did they become loyal? Certainly not; for were the pope to so bid them they would tomorrow become hostile again.

However well satisfied a Roman Catholic may be with government, however well his liberties may be guarded, his rights guaranteed, if "the church" so bids him he must assume an attitude of hostility to that government. The pope claims the right to depose kings and to set up kings, and to absolve from their allegiance to any given government a whole people. It is this preposterous claim that makes Rome the enemy not only of religious liberty but of civil liberty as well.

The essence of Protestantism is the right of private judgment subject only to the divine law. The essence of popery is submission to the pope. The divine law commands obedience to civil rulers in all civil things, and obedience to God in all things religious. This is a principle of universal application and admits of entire loyalty both to divine and human government, for it is an unchanging rule and one of universal and uniform application. The papal rule is, however, no more stable than is man himself, for it makes the pope, who is only a man, and the man of sin at that, the arbiter and judge in both civil and religious things. Hence, a vassal of the pope can be only provisionally loyal to any civil government, his loyalty being always conditioned on the will of his supreme master, who assumes the right to depose kings and to set up kings.
