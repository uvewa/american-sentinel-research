## WHAT SABBATH-KEEPING IS.

We have already learned that the Sabbath rest is a spiritual rest, and it is therefore impossible for one to keep the Sabbath unless Christ, whose presence gives rest, dwells in his heart by faith. Every case of conversion is a display of the creative power of God in calling out of darkness into light, in delivering from the power of darkness and translating into the kingdom of his dear Son; and the true Sabbath is a sign to every Christian of the creative power that has thus wrought for his deliverance, and which is to uphold him through all his varied experiences, as he journeys toward the eternal kingdom. As the Israelites were enabled to keep the Sabbath after they were brought out of Egypt, so the Christian, who has been delivered from the bondage of sin, can enjoy the spiritual rest, which is the true idea of Sabbath-keeping.

So the Sabbath is a sign to every Christian of the creative power of God in his deliverance from the power of sin. It is a sign to him of the blessing of God in turning him away from his iniquities. It is a sign to him of the presence of Christ to make him holy. It is a sign to him of the presence of Christ in him to sanctify him. That is to say, it is a measure of the working of that creative power in his individual experience.

But the real purpose of God in creation will not be fully carried out, until all who receive Jesus Christ have been created anew, until the body has been fashioned anew, "that it may be conformed to the body of his glory," until the new heavens and the new earth are made. Then, with the new heavens and the new earth, with the body conformed to his glorious body, and with the character of God in Jesus Christ wrought in them by faith, the earth will be peopled with a righteous people, just as God intended in the first place, and just in pursuance of his original plan of creation. And so in the new earth the Sabbath will remain, the sign of God's power in a completed creation. And thus we read in Isa. 66:22, 23: "For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the Lord, so shall your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord." And so onward through all the ages of eternity, the Sabbath will always be the sign of the creative power of God.

What, then, is the Sabbath?—It is the memorial of the power of God manifested to the world through Jesus Christ, not only in the creation of the heaven and the earth, but in the re-creation of the individual. What, then, is Sabbath-keeping?—It is Christian experience. What, then, is the Sabbath blessing?—It is the blessing of sanctification by the power of God working through Jesus Christ. What, then, is Sabbath-keeping?—It is the sign to the individual Christian of his own Christian experience. It is to him the measure of the working of that creative power of God in Jesus Christ, that he may be renewed in the image of God, that he may be made a perfect man in Christ Jesus. What, then, is Sabbath-keeping?—It is the sign to the Christian that he trusts for salvation in the power that created all things. What, then, is Sabbath-keeping?—It is the sign to the Christian that his hope, his confidence, are entirely in Jesus Christ, who is the Creator and Redeemer. What, then, is Sabbath-keeping?—It is the sign of his growth in Jesus Christ. What, then, is Sabbath-keeping?—It is all and in all to the Christian.

When it is understood what the Sabbath really is and what Sabbath-keeping is, there is not a person who desires Jesus Christ, there is not a person who longs for the blessings and the rest that there are in Jesus Christ, who would hesitate one moment as to what day it is. It is what it is rather than when it is that we must consider, because when we study what it is, we shall at the same time find out in the most emphatic way when it is. One day will do just as well as another in which to rest physically, but there is only one day on which we can keep Sabbath; there is only one day that has the blessing by the presence of Christ in this way. Come to the Sabbath blessing; come to Sabbath-keeping.

## THE SABBATH SATAN'S OBJECT OF ATTACK.

It being evident that the Sabbath is designed to turn men's minds toward the true God and Jesus Christ as the agent in creation and in redemption, it follows that if any movement is to be made to defeat the plan of God in the salvation of man, in the re-creation of man, the first thing to be done is to turn men away from the Sabbath, the reminder of Jesus Christ as the only Saviour. If men's minds can be turned away from Christ, they will fail of salvation. Christ's power is the only power sufficient to save. If men can be led to trust in any other power, they will be disappointed in all hope of salvation. Therefore the most certain way to defeat the plan of God in Christ for the salvation of men, is to turn men's minds away from Christ; and the first thing to be done, then, is to turn men's minds away from that which reminds them of Christ. Therefore, if the Sabbath can be hidden, if men's minds can be turned from the Sabbath, and the meaning of the Sabbath, a successful move has been made in turning men away from the plan of salvation in Jesus Christ.

There is one being who has made it his purpose for these many years to oppose the work of Jesus Christ for the salvation of the human race. Created an angel of light, made an anointed cherub, standing in the immediate presence of God, one on whom the light of the glory of God shone in a most remarkable and special manner, Lucifer, filled with envy that he was not made equal to Christ, and that the honor which belonged to Christ was not given to him, rebelled against God. His heart was filled with pride and envy, and he turned against the government of God. In spite of every offer of mercy, he persisted in rebellion until his own course cast him out of heaven. Since that time Satan's purpose has been to defeat the plan of God for the salvation of men. Having hired man into sin that he might involve him in the same penalty with himself, he has sought to keep man away from God's plan to save him. He has sought to induce the human family to put their trust in him and his power, instead of in Christ and his power.

The root of the trouble which caused Satan to be cast out of heaven, which brought rebellion into the government of God, and which has resulted in this earth being cursed by sin, was simply this: that Satan, given this exalted position in the presence of God, was not yet satisfied, but envied the position occupied by the Son of God, and desired that the honor which was bestowed upon Jesus Christ should be bestowed upon himself. God had given him an exalted position, yet it did not satisfy his ambition, and he sought the place occupied by Jesus Christ. Persisting in this, and refusing to give up his own way and his own selfish ambition, he was necessarily cast out of heaven. From that day he has worked on this same line. He has stirred up just that same feeling of self-exaltation in the hearts of the human family, and all these centuries, he has not given up that one plan and project of his, which is that, if possible, he should occupy the place which belongs to Christ; that, if possible, the homage due to Christ should be paid to himself instead of to Christ. And from that time to this he has tried to put himself in the place of Christ; he has tried to turn men away from God as manifested through Jesus Christ.

## SUN-WORSHIP AND SUNDAY.

Our worship is due to God as revealed in Jesus Christ, since he is the Creator, and to pay that homage to any other person or thing is idolatry. All idolatry is instigated by Satan in his efforts to turn men from the true God, and is in essence a worship of Satan as opposed to the worship of the true God. The most ancient and widespread form of idolatry was sun-worship. Under one name or another, and represented by different symbols, the sun was worshiped by all the heathen nations of antiquity; and as this worship took the lead, the day devoted to this worship—Sun's day, or Sunday—was a special day in the heathen calendar; and there is a reason for all this.

It is said of God that he "only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto." And again; "Bless the Lord, O my soul. O Lord my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honor and majesty. Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment." Ps. 104:1-2. Light—an outward representation as it were, of God in Jesus Christ—light was created on the first day of the week. "And God said, Let there be light; and there was light, . . . and the evening and the morning were the first day." Gen. 1:3, 5.

And so men's minds were turned away from God, who dwells in light and who covers himself with light as with a garment, to the light, and the light bearer, and were led to worship the sun. We have traces of this all through the Scriptures. "If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness: and my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand; this also were an iniquity to be punished by the Judge; for I should have denied the God that is above." Job 31:26-28. The manner of worship was to salute the images of the sun by kissing the hand; and Job as the proof of his loyalty to the true God, appeals to the fact that he never worshiped either the sun or the moon.

When the children of Israel were delivered from Egypt, and were on their way to the promised land, they were instructed, above all things, to have nothing to do with this form of idolatry. "Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee; but ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves; for thou shalt worship no other god; for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God." Ex. 34:12-14. The "groves," or "Asherim," as they are called in the Revised Version, were sun images, lofty pillars of any material.

So universal was this worship, that when the children of Israel were on their way to Jerusalem, to the annual feasts, as they passed by, they would see upon the hills these groves, indicating sun-worship, and they sang this psalm on the way: "Shall I lift up mine eyes to the hills? whence should my help come?" Then came the answer: "My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth." Ps. 121:1, 2 (margin). How thoroughly this idea of sun-worship was in-wrought into everything! And the reason is clear. Shall I lift up my eyes to the hills? that is, shall I engage in idolatry, sun-worship? From whence cometh my help? My help does not come from any such source as that. Those are the false gods. My help cometh from the Lord who made the heaven and the earth, that is, the Creator; and the Sabbath all the time was the sign to them of that Creator and his power to save, as opposed to any power that might be claimed for the false gods which did not make the heaven and the earth.

The sun was worshiped toward the east, and so worshiping toward the east was the greatest abomination. We have reference to this in the eighth chapter of Ezekiel. After showing to the prophet a variety of abominations that had come into the worship, on the part of the children of Israel who had departed from the true God, we read in the fifteenth and sixteenth verses: "Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O Son of man? turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than these. And he brought me into the inner court of the Lord's house, and behold, at the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the alter, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the Lord, and their faces toward the east; and they worshiped the sun toward the east." And that was the climax of all the abominations that the prophet was shown.

So particular was God to guard his people against even the semblance of sun-worship that he ordered his tabernacle to be pitched with the door toward the east; then, when they came into the temple of God, as the door was open toward the east, they turned their backs on the sun and turned their faces toward the true God.

They turned their backs on the sun and sun-worship, and they looked to the Lord. That was his invitation: "Look unto me and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth, for I am God, and there is none else." But when they worshiped toward the east, they turned their backs upon the law of God in his temple, in his tabernacle; they then cast the law of God behind their backs. So, every time we turn away from the true Sabbath, we turn our backs upon the law of God, and our faces toward the false gods.
