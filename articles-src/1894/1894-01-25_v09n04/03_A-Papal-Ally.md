The Catholic Review notes with evident satisfaction the fact that in an interview given a reporter of the Baltimore Sun recently, Right Reverend Bishop Penick, General Agent of the Protestant Episcopal Church for its work among the colored people in the United States said:—

It has been interesting and gratifying to watch the drift of the controversy on State aid for parochial schools, and through it feel the loyal heart-beat of the intelligence of the country for our institutions. Being a Protestant, I hold in common with other Protestants that denominations should keep their hands off of the public school funds. But owing to the fact that for some time past my studies have been much occupied with the drift of the young life of the land toward criminality, I do most heartily feel with the Roman Catholics in their desire to have their children instructed in things deeper than mere secular knowledge. When we know that in 1850 we had but one criminal to 3,500 population, and to-day we have one to about every 645 of us, surely the demand for moral training seems to be sufficiently loud to startle all who love their country and their children.

This is so; but another thing is also so, namely, that a very large proportion of these criminals have been "educated" in popish schools and instructed by popish priests. And yet it seems that the bishop is ready to go down into Egypt for help.
