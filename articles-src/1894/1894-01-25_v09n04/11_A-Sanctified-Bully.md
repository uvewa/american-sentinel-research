As it is by professors of religion that persecution is brought upon observers of the seventh day, so it takes professors of religion to defend it. The following is copied from the Christian Advocate of Detroit, Mich., of December 2, 1893:—

The Seventh-day Adventists of Battle Creek are reported as about to scatter to the four winds for the purpose of being persecuted and oppressed by the dreadful people of this world who believe in keeping the Lord's day and not the Jewish Sabbath. Now, if these saints will behave themselves on Sunday, as well as on other days, we will venture that they will not suffer much. But if they are going to be offensively boisterous and loud on the Christian Sabbath, as is too frequently their custom, they will deserve the legal penalties whether they receive them or not.

The foregoing betrays a spirit of which no one need have very much reason to be proud. The Advocate has heard of the persecution of the observers of the seventh day, or it would not mention it. It, therefore, very well knows that those who have been arrested and imprisoned were not making themselves "offensively boisterous and loud," but had to be searched out before it could be ascertained that they were doing any work whatever. But it has no inquiry to make, as to whether a wrong may not have been done, no word of condemnation for the manifest partisanship and injustice that has been exhibited, but only a sneer for the people, a misrepresentation of the facts, and an intimation that they do not receive, even yet, what they deserve! It was out of just such choicest spirits as the writer of the paragraph under notice, that the blackest inquisitors of the Dark Ages were made; and should they be called for again, it seems there is suitable timber ready for the office. We know not what profession the writer of the foregoing paragraph makes, but we know from his language what he is: he has simply thrown off the mask, and stands before the world in the attitude of a self-righteous, self-sanctified bully.
