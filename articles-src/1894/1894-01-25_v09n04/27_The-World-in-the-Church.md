"THE World in the Church" is a pamphlet of 104 pages, by Rev. John Sawyer, D. D., of the M. E. Church, South. It is an excellent commentary on such texts as 2 Tim. 3:1-9, and should be in the hands of every one who feels any burden to warn the professed Church of Christ of her fallen condition. The Pacific Press, 43 Bond Street, New York, will fill orders for this pamphlet at the publisher's price, 25 cents. Don't fail to secure a copy at once.
