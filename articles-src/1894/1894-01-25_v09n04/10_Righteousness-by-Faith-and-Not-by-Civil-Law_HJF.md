The standard of righteousness as held by Protestants in general is the same, namely, the ten commandments. The Baptists, Methodists, Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Unitarians and others in this country hold with us the same standard by which righteousness is determined—the ten commandments. (See catechisms and creeds of the different churches.) This same standard of righteousness is held to by nearly all the Christian churches in the world, at least in theory if not in practice.

But how this righteousness is obtained, is where the difference of opinion arises. Our position is that righteousness is obtained only by faith in Christ, and faith alone. While nearly all the above named denominations hold to the same in theory; yet many of them in words and in fact deny it. This is emphatically true of National Reformers. Said Jonathan Edwards in a speech before a National Reform Convention in New York City Feb. 27, 1873, "We want State and religion, and we are going to have it. It shall be that so far as the affairs of State require religion, it shall be religion—the religion of Jesus Christ. The Christian oath and Christian morality shall have in this land 'an undeniable legal basis.' We use the word religion in its proper sense, as meaning a man's personal relation of faith and obedience to God." Mr. Edwards then believed in State and religion combined, for he said: "So far as the affairs of State require religion, it shall be the religion of Jesus Christ." It is plain from this statement, that in order for a man to have righteousness in the eyes of the State, he must conform to the standard of righteousness set up by the State religion; and as it is the business of the State to define and enforce its righteousness upon the people, it follows that the people get their righteousness from the State and not from Jesus Christ. Again, as the State is made up of men and they make and define the righteousness of the State, then it is a man-made righteousness which they get and not the righteousness of Jesus Christ. Moreover, as all our (man's) righteousness is as filthy rags; they get from the State filthy rags and not the righteousness of Christ. Furthermore, as all things that are not of faith are sin, (Rom. 14:23), and the man who gets righteousness from the State does not exercise faith in Christ, because the State stands between him and Christ, he gets sin instead of righteousness and nothing but sin. The further impossibility of obtaining righteousness by legislative enactments may be seen by considering a few passages of scripture. Rom. 3:23, "For all have sinned," "And all are unclean." Job 14:4. How can man then, by combination and civil law, produce a clean thing out of an unclean? As well might we expect to gather figs of thorns, or grapes from brambles, as to think of getting righteousness out of, or by means of, any code of laws enforced by human enactments. Righteousness is of God by faith in Jesus Christ unto all them that believe. Rom. 3:22. This is of the heart and life and not in outward observance. Is it possible for any human law to change the heart of man? As well might the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots, as for a nation to make men righteous; no matter if the nation calls itself Christian, it is still wicked.

It is further evident that no man can get righteousness by even keeping the law of God. The reasons for this are the same as in the other case, man is carnal and the law is spiritual; consequently he must be created a spiritual being. This new creation is wrought by faith in Christ. It is in this way that a man becomes righteous, and in no other way. The Apostle Paul learned this lesson when he said, "What things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ, yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord; for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung that I may win Christ, and be found in him [Christ], not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith." Phil. 3:7-9.

The one who is made righteous by faith in Christ Jesus, and who retains him in his life will be himself just like the law of righteousness in Christ, the ten commandments, so that the things contained in the law will be done in him. "For," says the apostle, "it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure." Phil. 2:13. So the work is all of God in Christ. Said Christ, "Without me ye can do nothing." It is said of the remnant church, Rev. 12:17 and 14:12, that "they keep the commandments [righteousness] of God and the faith of Jesus." This last clause tells how it is that they keep the righteousness of God, by simply keeping "the faith of Jesus," which in turn makes them righteous and keeps them so. This is righteousness by faith and nothing else is.
