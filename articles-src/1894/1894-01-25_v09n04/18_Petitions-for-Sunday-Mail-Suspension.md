It is stated that the advocates of legally enforced Sunday rest claim to have petitions representing 10,000,000 adults in favor of the suspension of Sunday mails.

An exchange says that Sunday mails are now to be attacked "with all the available forces of Sabbatarianism." Not so; Sabbatarians do not object to Sunday mails. It is Sunday keepers who war against Sunday mails.
