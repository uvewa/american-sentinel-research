It is said that a bill has been prepared and will be introduced in the Iowa legislature as a substitute for the present prohibitory law. It provides that the council of a city or town may grant to a corporation of not less than twenty-five resident freeholders an exclusive franchise for the term of ten years for the sale of liquors. Prescribing how the corporation shall be managed, etc., it provides that after a five per cent. semi-annual dividend is paid, the remainder of the profits shall go to the city or town, to the school district and to the Young Men's Christian Association! But what of it? The fines for Sunday work in Georgia go for the support of Sunday schools; why not license money as well go for the support of the Young Men's Christian Association? Or why not give it direct to the dominant church? or to the church making the largest number of converts during the revival season? This would be eminently practical for it would mightily stimulate Christian (?) effort.
