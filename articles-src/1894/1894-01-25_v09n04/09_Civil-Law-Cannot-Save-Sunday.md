Rev. Dr. J. H. Knowles, in Mail and Express (New York), says:—

The present is an age of intense social agitation, a time when all divinely ordained institutions are tested even to their very foundations. The holy Sabbath, especially, is in imminent danger. Many who bear the Christian name have admitted the secular spirit into the home and church on the Lord's day; some have suffered habits of self-indulgence to impoverish their religious nature; in some cases the excitements of worldly pleasure dissipate serious thought; while in not a few God's blessed Word is no longer relished on the Sabbath on account of the preoccupancy of the modern Sunday paper.

We may well ask. What is the right basis of action in attempting to remedy these evils? Shall we fly to civil law and plead for protection against Sabbath evasion?

Shall we seize human weapons? Do we hope to stem this mighty current by human skill and force? The holy Sabbath rests upon moral, not upon mere positive, injunction. All moral injunctions are to be regarded by us as perpetually binding; as accompanied by penalties whenever disregarded; as accordant with reason, and as answering to that mental and physical constitution which God has given to us.

We may, therefore, despair of finding relief in any method which overlooks the moral. Force is powerless. More than this. Human force, however, helpful and necessary in certain exigencies, may provoke needless hostility and precipitate evil results whenever moral questions are denied their moral basis. The Sabbath—God's designated day for holy rest and worship—is to be upheld by assigning moral reasons, by seeking through divinely wrought convictions to preserve its sanctity, and not by the authority of civil statutes.

It is not enough to rely on "moral" forces unless the term is made to include, as the only basis of success, religious conscience. It would seem as though men like Dr. Knowles would see the utter hopelessness of the efforts to secure reform by law, however devoutly they may believe in Sunday. The Sabbath, the Sabbath idea and Sabbath-keeping must rest on God's Word and the divine law. Anything less is "sinking sand." Every effort to accomplish the observance of Sunday, or of any other day, as a Sabbath by civil law, sinks it deeper in the mire of holidayism. If the Bible plainly upholds Sunday, the issue can be trusted by that standard. If it does not—as it certainly does not—all other efforts only cultivate disaster.
