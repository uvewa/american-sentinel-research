To the Editor of the Herald:

I read the following in the Herald today:

Morris Lichenaeun, of No. 220 Bowery, was arrested Sunday by Detective Sloan for selling him a shoestring for two cents in Park Row. Lichenaeun was held in $100 bail in the Tombs to stand trial for violation of the Sunday law.

There is justice for you! There is "detective work" worthy of the name! Sloan ought to have a higher place. A man who can accomplish such results without endangering life or limb should be promoted at once. Think of it! Such a hardened wretch as this Lichenaeun must be, secretly, perhaps, and with malice aforethought, to assail the peace and safety of the great city of New York—the city which once boasted Tweed and which now boasts a still greater, Tammany—by selling a shoestring in the street on Sunday!

What training Sloan must have gone through beforehand to enable him to cajole this sin-steeped, godless, Sunday-breaking vender of shoestring to deliberately transact business—yes, Mr. Weller, business to such an extent—on the "American Sabbath"!

What piety, what sincere, Sabbath-keeping piety, must have filled the soul of this detective as he walked softly out in the hush of the sacred city on its sacred day with two consecrated cents in his pious pocket with which to tempt Lichtenstein to the great wickedness which the Herald reports so graphically! How proudly he must have led the criminal toward the Tombs, conscious that he was saving the commonwealth of New York, and its holy city, from the terrible results of the base machinations and the unholy purposes of a man who dared to go in the streets and place himself where he could be tempted to do this horrid thing—tempted, too, by the agent of the government he assailed!

Think again how sacred that money was when it rested in the pious pocket of Sloan. Was it a "punched" dime, and did he get back eight cents in good money, and a shoestring, too? And what devil's price of blood it was the moment it touched the itching, sin-stained palm of the depraved seller of shoestrings!

Let it not be said henceforth that New York City is not governed—aye, governed in the interests of religion and morality. Let no man hereafter dare to doubt the future triumph of the "American Sabbath" when such feats as Sloan's can be accomplished and men live to tell the tale. When such things can be, the wicked "continental Sunday" must go to a seat which is not in the front row.

But the magnanimity of that judge! Out on bail for such a crime, and such paltry bail, $100 against two cents! There was never such a thing in history before. Surely "the quality of mercy is not strained" when such a pestilential fellow as Lichenaeun can come again next Sunday if he will and hold his tempting bait before the eyes of officers and citizens and whisper amid the holy hush of cabs and cable cars, "Shoestrings; shoestrings."

Olempora. O mores.
