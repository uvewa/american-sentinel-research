"The czar and the pope," remarks an exchange, "have exchanged autograph letters on the religious situation. It is believed that the disposition on the part of Russia and the Vatican to reestablish a religious entente is firmer than ever." It is said that when rogues fall out honest men get their dues; but what happens when tyrants are made friends? If the future is to be judged from the past no good can come to true Christians by any understanding between the pope and the czar. It was over the arrest and trial of Christ that Herod and Pilate were made friends; and our Lord's crucifixion immediately followed.
