## OCR Corrections Made

### Page 1, Masthead
- **OCR read:** "ALONEO T. JONES"
- **Corrected to:** "ALONZO T. JONES"
- **Reason:** Known editor name; obvious OCR error (O instead of Z)

### Page 1, Masthead
- **OCR read:** "BOLLHAN"
- **Corrected to:** "BOLLMAN"
- **Reason:** Known associate editor name; obvious OCR error

### Page 1, Masthead
- **OCR read:** "WILLIAM H. BULKES"
- **Corrected to:** "WILLIAM H. MCKEE"
- **Reason:** Known associate editor name from 1894; "BULKES" is OCR error for "MCKEE"

### Page 3, Article about Job
- **OCR read:** "Joh. 31:26-28"
- **Corrected to:** "Job 31:26-28"
- **Reason:** Context makes clear this is the book of Job, not John

### Page 6, Article title
- **OCR read:** "Olempora"
- **Corrected to:** "O tempora"
- **Reason:** Latin phrase "O tempora, O mores" (Oh the times, oh the customs); OCR misread

### Page 6, Advertisement
- **OCR read:** "NEXAS"
- **Likely should be:** Left as is (unclear context)
- **Note:** Advertisement text garbled by OCR; preserved as-is since it's advertising material

### Page 8, Secretary name
- **OCR read:** "DANIEL S. LAMOT"
- **Corrected to:** "DANIEL S. LAMONT"
- **Reason:** Known Secretary of War under Cleveland; obvious OCR error

## General Notes

- The OCR quality for this issue was generally very good
- Most errors were in proper names where OCR misread similar-looking letters
- Advertisement text was sometimes garbled but left as-is since it's not article content
- Page headers and running titles were stripped as instructed
