WHILE others have been talking of dividing the public school funds, the Roman Catholics of Subdistrict No. 1, Marion Township, Mercer County, Ohio, have seized the school and devoted it to the sectarian ends of that church. The fact that the law is dead against them seems to have been ignored for fifteen years, during which time Catholic Readers, Catholic Church History, and the Catholic Catechism have been taught by teachers paid by public money. For many years the local priest has had charge for a quarter of every Thursday, and exercised and reviewed the school exactly as though it had been Catholic. Moreover, it has been regularly dismissed on every Catholic holiday. All this, and more, has been brought out by the official report of Inspector D. F. Daniels to State School Commissioner Carson. The report concludes:—

After a careful investigation I believe the charges laid against the management of said district are true; that a considerable portion of the money expended for tuition has been misapplied as alleged; that abuses exist in said district that call for immediate correction; that the real welfare of the children, irrespective of sectarian affiliation, requires a complete divorce of church and school, and a rigid enforcement of the same laws to which the people elsewhere accord a ready obedience.

Isn't it a shame to interfere with them? Of course Methodists, or Baptists, or any Protestant or Jewish sect, would not be suffered to use the public schools to propagate their faith. But then their faith is heresy. Heretics have no rights. Moreover, Satolli says that "the Catholic education is the surest safeguard of the permanence throughout the centuries of the Constitution, and the best guide to the Republic in civil progress." Of course Satolli knows. Why not, then, turn over to him the whole system of public instruction? Otherwise the Constitution will not be "permanent throughout the centuries," and the Republic will lack "the best guide in civil progress." For does not Satolli also say: "The more public opinion and the Government will favor the Catholic schools, more and more will the welfare of the commonwealth be advanced"? Such being the case, we submit that Subdistrict No. 1 should be approved and not censured; and Inspector Daniels should be bastinadoed! Incorrigible heretic! Moreover, how unreasonable to compel Satolli, Cardinal Gibbons, and the Catholics generally, to resort to the slow process of circulating petitions throughout Maryland to secure from the reluctant legislature a division of the school funds, which process has already been extended to New York, and will be, it is said, to all the States! Rather should a spontaneous impulse seize the breasts of all in authority to make over the schools to Rome, and set the seal of everlasting and most loyal submission by kissing the pope's great toe!
