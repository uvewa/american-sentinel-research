Once, the Baptists were the defenders of religious liberty in this country. When it was sought to establish the Church of England in Virginia, Baptists opposed it. And when it was proposed to levy a tax for the support of "the Christian religion" they opposed that also, because the same power that could establish Christianity to the exclusion of all other religions, could with the same ease establish any sect of Christianity to the exclusion of all other sects.

But times change and Baptists change with them. Then the Baptists were a small sect struggling for existence, and had but recently felt the hand of persecution. In Virginia their ministers had been arrested as "disturbers of the peace," simply because they had held meetings at which rude fellows of the baser sort had made disturbance. Holding and teaching doctrines and practices contrary to the prevailing doctrines and practices was the real offense. The "disturbance" was only a pretext. It is even so now. Adventists are, in various places, arrested and imprisoned, nominally for working on Sunday; but really for teaching and practicing contrary to the opinions and practices of their neighbors. And Baptists justify this persecution and demand that it shall be continued!

The Standard, a Baptist paper published in Chicago, has in its issue of December 7, an article by Rev. W. H. Geistweit, and also an editorial note on this subject, which fully justify the statement that Baptists are proving recreant to their principles and are belying their record as defenders of soul liberty. Mr. Geistweit says:

Is the enforcement of the Sunday law religious persecution? Some ignorant people talk that way. Indeed, it so happens many supposedly intelligent people argue in that direction. Let me answer it by asking another question: Is the trial of a thief religious persecution? Certainly not, you answer. But isn't the commandment "Thou shalt not steal" in the Bible? Keep in mind this view as I try to answer the first question more directly. The government, for the good of society, declares that a man shall not steal; it doesn't declare it, primarily, because thievery is a sin against God; it is a law for the good of the whole family. This Government, the people who mold sentiment, which crystallizes into law,—declare that for the good of society, and the welfare of the country, the wheels of business shall stop on the first day of the week; it is not intended, primarily, that men shall obey the law because it is a religious thing; the good of the whole family is aimed at. And just as a violation of the law against thievery is a crime against the family, so a violation of a Sunday law is a crime against the family. Its religious aspect has no foothold in the government's view. To arrest a man for working on Sunday, for keeping open his saloon or store, is not religious persecution. If our Government should pass a law naming Wednesday as a day of rest, for the good of the family, as law-abiding citizens we should not work on that day. We might observe any other day, the first, or seventh, as our conscience dictates, but that does not give us license to break a law which in the opinion of the Government is for the good of the whole family. The Seventh-day Adventists work harder on Sunday than on any other day in the week, to show their contempt for the religious aspect of the day. But they are law-breakers, not necessarily against God, but against the laws of the country in which they live. I have looked for this view of the case, and am surprised to see so little made of it. But it seems to me that this is the very kernel of the whole matter. The maintenance of a civil law cannot be ascribed to religious persecution. Yet that cry is always raised when you come to discuss the Sunday question. The Government, under the Constitution, says: "You may think as you please, you may pray as you please, you may be a Trinitarian, or a Unitarian, or an infidel; you may have as many holy days as you please; but to save this Government, to perpetuate it for the common good, to save it from anarchy and bloodshed, it is deemed wise to say to the wheels of industry "stop." One day in seven is necessary to good citizenship; if you go contrary to it, you are a law-breaker, and should be punished for it.

The fallacy in his is in confounding civil and religious things. Laws for the protection of property are demanded in the interests of natural rights. But laws for the protection of Sunday are demanded solely in the interests of a religious dogma. The "good of society" is simply a pretext. Were Sunday not a religious institution we would hear nothing of Sunday laws. Nobody ever heard of an enforced holiday. It is only holy days that are forced upon people by law.

But the real animus of the article is most clearly seen when we remember that it was written from a State which makes legal provision for ordinary labor on the first day of the week by those who observe another day. But notwithstanding this, this professed minister of the gospel, and a Baptist, brands as "law-breakers" who "ought to be punished" Seventh-day Adventists who work on Sunday!

There was a time when in Massachusetts they had a law which required that for the good of society all parents should have their children sprinkled. Baptists refused to obey that law and were whipped. Was it not religious persecution? Certainly; but it was supported by arguments very similar to those now urged in defense of Sunday laws. The neglect of infant "baptism" and the vows which accompanied it, it was urged would tend to immorality and irreligion, and thus the very foundations of society would be sapped. The argument was just as good and just as valid as is the argument made in support of Sunday legislation.

Another law of Massachusetts was that everybody should on Sunday reverently attend divine services. Certain Baptists failing to recognize the services of the Established Church of the colony as "divine services," refused to attend, and when forcibly taken to the meeting-house refused to remove their hats, or to otherwise manifest a reverence which they did not feel. For this they were cruelly whipped. Was this religious persecution? Certainly; and yet degenerate sons of noble Baptist fathers declare that the imprisonment of Adventists for Sunday work is not religious persecution, and attempt to justify Sunday legislation! And the Standard, a representative Baptist paper, commends this spirit and this demand, saying of the article from which we have quoted that it "makes clear the real significance of the attitude assumed toward violators of law, even when this attitude is assumed in the name of Christianity itself. Separation of Church and State does not mean the leaving of society to go to perdition, while discussing theological abstractions from the pulpit, or singing hymns in prayer-meetings." Roger Williams and a host of noble Baptist martyrs would blush for such representatives of Baptist principles.
