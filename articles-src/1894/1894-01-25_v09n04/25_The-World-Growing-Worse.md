"In Philadelphia," says the New York *Christian Advocate*, "an elderly citizen of excellent repute, in a public address, is reported to have said that in his opinion 'the world is growing better morally, religiously, and physically; in fact, better every way except politically.' This opinion, continues the *Advocate*, "must be wrong either in the main proposition or in the exception." It is wrong in everything but the exception. 'Evil men and seducers' are waxing 'worse and worse' according to the testimony of the Word of God. And as foretold in the same Word even the churches are filled with those 'having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof.'"
