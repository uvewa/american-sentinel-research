"Vick's Floral Guide" has always seemed to us to be as near perfection as a publication of that description could well be made, but the "Guide" for 1894 certainly surpasses all its predecessors, and is indeed "a thing of beauty." But beauty is not its only good feature; it contains descriptions that describe, not mislead; illustrations that instruct, not exaggerate. This year it comes to us in a suit of gold. Printed in eight different colors besides black. Colored plates of Chrysanthemums, Poppies and Vegetables. On the front cover is a very exquisite bunch of Vick's New White Branching Aster, and on the back is the New Double Anemone; 112 pages filled with many new novelties of value as well as all the old leading varieties of flowers and vegetables.

We advise our friends who intend doing anything in the garden this year to consult Vick before starting operations. Send 10 cents to James Vick's Sons, Rochester, N. Y., for Vick's Guide, it costs nothing, as you can deduct the 10 cents from first order. It certainly will pay you.
