THE Herald and Presbyter remarks that "all Romanists are not so candid as the great Ultramontane editor Veuillot, who wrote, 'When Protestants are in the ascendancy, we demand religious liberty, because that is their doctrine; but when Catholicism is in the ascendancy, we deny religious liberty, because that is our doctrine.'" There are not a few so-called Protestants who might make a like confession were they so disposed. Even in "free America" religious liberty has its metes and bounds, and the line is not drawn at the demands of civil justice either. Much that is called religious liberty is at best only religious toleration; and tolerance is necessarily a denial of inalienable right. The assumption of the right to tolerate is an assertion of the right to prohibit.
