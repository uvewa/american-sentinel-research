THE Catholic Mirror of the 13th instant is out with a long article denouncing as religious persecution the imprisonment of Sabbatarians in Maryland for Sunday work. It is rather late in the day for Roman Catholics to cry out against governmental enforcement of religion. The writer of the article in question may be candid enough in what he says, but the whole system is at fault. The imprisonment, by so-called Protestants, of men for refusal to do homage to the papal Sunday, is simply the logical outcome of papal principles. No doubt individual papists revolt at the injustice, but the system is responsible for it. This will be more and more apparent as the iniquity develops in this country.
