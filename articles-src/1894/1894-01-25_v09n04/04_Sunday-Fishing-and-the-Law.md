The Court of Appeals has decided, four to three, that all fishing on Sunday in this State is contrary to law and a penal offense, whether done in open waters or in private ponds.

This is in accordance with the attorney-general's recent ruling that the game and fish commissioners have nothing to do with the enforcement of the statute against Sunday fishing, because that statute was not enacted for the preservation of fish, but for the preservation of the Sabbatarian character of Sunday.

Now why should not this law be repealed? It exists solely for the purpose of enforcing the religious observance of a day, and under our system and idea of government the State has no proper business to prescribe that or any other religious observance. It is not the function of government in a free country which rejects the idea of State and Church union to say what days any man shall or shall not "keep holy." It is the business of the State to protect all men equally in their perfect religious liberty and beyond that to keep its hands off.

Sunday fishing is in no sense disorderly. It is the quietest and most peaceful of occupations. Its prohibition cannot be justified upon any ground of necessity for the protection of anybody's peace.

To many thousands of very hardworking people an occasional Sunday's fishing is the only possible outing of a healthgiving, refreshing character. To forbid it by law merely because the theological notions of some persons condemn it is to impose one man's conscience upon the conduct of another without reason or right.

The law ought to be abolished.
