THE NEW YORK HERALD, of the 12th inst., contained this bit of local news:—

Captain John Drum, of the Tenth infantry, has been assigned to duty as professor of military science and tactics at the College of St. Francis Xavier, in this city.

An order to that effect issued from the Adjutant General's office, Washington, and signed by Secretary Lamont, has been received by the Rev. T. J. Campbell, S. J., president of the college. It is as follows:—

WAR DEPARTMENT,
WASHINGTON CITY, JAN. 4, 1894.

By direction of the President and in accordance with section 1.525, Revised Statutes, as amended by the acts of Congress approved September 26, 1888, and November 3, 1891, Captain John Drum, Tenth infantry, is detailed as professor of military science and tactics at the College of St. Francis Xavier, New York City, and will report in person for duty accordingly.

DANIEL S. LAMOT, Secretary of War.

St. Francis Xavier's College thus affords additional evidence that it is an eminently practical and progressive institution.

"Eminently practical," is a good term to describe a religious school that requires the services of a military instructor; it is certainly more practical than pious. Doubtless the military training to be given in this "eminently practical and progressive institution" is to be put to a very practical use in the not distant future. Military drill and armament are not designed by the papists of this country to be simply ornamental. They are for use.
