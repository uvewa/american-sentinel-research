AN Albany judge has decided that the law of this State does not give the police authorities power to require the closing of saloons on Sunday. The decision is:—

There is no law, notwithstanding the opinion of the Chief of Police and the police commissioners, that prevents a man from keeping his saloon open on Sunday. There is no law which prohibits a man from keeping his front door open or prohibits three, four or five, or a dozen people sitting in the saloon.

There must be exposure. Men have the right to sit there and amuse themselves quietly in any way they see fit, so far as they do not violate the law by being disorderly or drinking. The doors can be locked or unlocked. A man's saloon is his castle as much as his store or home. It is not within the power of the police to slip into them. It is not their business.

Of course this does not touch the question of selling liquor on Sunday, but only the power of the police authorities to require the actual closing of the room in which liquors are sold. It shows, however, the great flexibility of the Sunday law where the liquor interests are involved.

But while a man may actually keep his saloon open on Sunday, and there enjoy himself with his friends, he may not fish on Sunday in this State, even in his own private pond; for so the Court of Appeals of the great State of New York has decided. "This," remarks the World, "is in accordance with the attorney-general's recent ruling that the game and fish commissioners have nothing to do with the enforcement of the statute against Sunday fishing, because that statute was not enacted for the preservation of fish, but for the preservation of the Sabbatarian character of Sunday."
