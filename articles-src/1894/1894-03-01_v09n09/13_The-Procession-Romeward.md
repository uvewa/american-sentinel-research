THE Rt. Rev. Ignatius F. Horstman, D. D., Bishop of Cleveland, Ohio, has confirmed within the past sixteen months, thirty thousand born Catholics and nine hundred converts; and this within a territory embracing less than one-third of the State of Ohio. Such a happening, as our esteemed contemporary, the Catholic Universe, truly remarks, "tells the story of that silent procession Romeward which is gradually, but with certainty, changing the religious face of the country." And as it further says: "The ultimate conversion of America can only be delayed by the failure of Catholics to fully comprehend the nature of their terrible responsibility."—Boston Pilot.
