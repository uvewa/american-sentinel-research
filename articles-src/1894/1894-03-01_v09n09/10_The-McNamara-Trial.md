A CORRESPONDENT in Kansas City sends us the following concerning the trial of Ex-Priest James V. McNamara:—

McNamara lectured on Sunday night, January 14, and advertised then to speak again on Tuesday night to men only. The Catholics were stirred up over his first lecture, and according to the information which the attorneys claim to have, this mob was gotten up on Tuesday before he lectured in the evening, to mob him; and it is probable that not one of the mob heard him lecture. At least, the majority did not hear him, for they collected outside while the lecture was going on. Policemen were in the hall, and had he violated any law, they should have arrested him then and there, but they did nothing of the kind, and he was not arrested until two days later.

In his Tuesday night lecture, he proposed to show what is the Catholic theology in regard to "Auricular Confession." He read largely from Catholic books, showing what their teachings are on this subject. Reading that the priests were allowed to confess one to another such sins as sodomy, murder, lying, etc., and that the priests had the power to absolve the one so confessing. McNamara said that Father Dalton, Father Lillis, and others of the Catholic priests in Kansas City knew that this was so. And on the basis of this statement, that they knew these things were true, he was arrested for slander, and tried under section 3,969 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri, 1889.

The trial was by jury before the justice of the peace at Independence (McNamara having secured a change of venue). He was found guilty of slander as charged, and the jury made his fine $500 and twelve months imprisonment. This, on the second trial, the jury having disagreed on the first.

Now, the matter rests until February 26, when it will come up in the criminal court to which it was appealed.

We expect to have more definite information in regard to this matter after the trial before the higher court. It looks very much from the facts stated that the courts are being used to stifle free speech, at the behest of Romish priests, that the abominations of Rome may not be exposed. McNamara having been a Roman Catholic bishop, of Brooklyn, N. Y., certainly knows whereof he speaks; and his ability to make Rome wince is pretty good evidence that he tells a good deal of truth.
