THE following item appears in the Melbourne Age of January 4, 1894, and is an indication that the desire to enforce the papal Sabbath—the mark of the beast—upon the people, is by no means confined to America, but is becoming world-wide:—

A series of prosecutions arising out of complaints to the Chief Commissioner of Police by members of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, were instituted in the Richmond court yesterday against local shopkeepers for trading at other times than between the hours prescribed in the Police Act, viz.: from one to six o'clock. Twice previously, at the instance of the same complainants, the law was suddenly enforced, the chief cause of complaint being that children, on their way to Sunday school, are induced to spend their "collection box" pennies in fruit and lollies [candies].

The W. C. T. U. was not represented in court, the informants being Senior Constable Barrett and Constables Kelly, Teague and Donald. James Long, fruiterer, Bridgeroad, pleaded guilty to selling three penny worth of lollies and a packet of cigarettes to a girl at about 7:30 on the 17th ult. The bench inflicted a fine of one shilling, and advised defendant it would be better for him to observe the law in future.

Four others, "charged with having sold small parcels of fruit and lollies," were also each fined one shilling. Another, a milkman, was fined five shillings. As in America, so in Australia, the Women's Christian Temperance Union is forgetting its legitimate sphere, ceasing to do its first works, and beginning to be switched off to be used by the great deceiver as a tool for carrying on religious persecution. While confined just at present to petty offenses, seemingly too insignificant cases for the attention of rational beings, their eyes will no doubt ere long be turned more directly toward those who observe the Bible Sabbath, the seventh day, against the observance of which all Sunday legislation has, on the part of its author, ever been directed.
