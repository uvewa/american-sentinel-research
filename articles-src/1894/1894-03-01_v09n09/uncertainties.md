## OCR Corrections Made

1. **Page 1, Column 2, Line 32**: OCR read "tbe" → corrected to "the" (obvious typo)
2. **Page 2, Line 63**: OCR read "chace" → corrected to "chaos" (Father Sherman quote context confirms)
3. **Page 5, Line 212**: OCR read "lollies [sandies]" → retained as "lollies [candies]" (bracketed term appears to be OCR interpretation, changed to standard American term)
4. **Page 6, Line 252**: OCR read "3 Thess. 3:4" → corrected to "2 Thess. 2:4" (verified correct biblical reference)
5. **Page 7, Line 362**: OCR read "MARCH 1, 1804" → corrected to "MARCH 1, 1894" (obvious date error)
6. **Masthead, Line 22**: OCR read "CALVIN F. MULLMAN" → corrected to "CALVIN P. BOLLMAN" (known associate editor per project context)
