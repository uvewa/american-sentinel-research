TOPEKA, Kansas, is agitated over the matter of Sunday closing. A recent dispatch from that city says:—

The City Council has passed a very strict Sunday-closing ordinance, which is agitating the populace and the police. It provides for a fine and imprisonment for any person "who shall expose to sale any goods, wares or merchandise, or who shall sell any goods, wares or merchandise," in Topeka. The mayor has the ordinance under advisement, and while it is known that he personally favors the provisions of it, he says that he will try to discover whether the people want the ordinance or not.

The chief of police said that if the mayor signed the ordinance and it was published, it would be immediately and forcibly put into effect, and that he would guarantee that the smokers, the readers of daily papers and those who enjoy a pleasure drive on Sunday in a livery rig, would very quickly discover that the law was not a dead letter. "But," said the chief, "I wish that the City Council had made provision in that ordinance for the building of a wall around the city and painting that wall white, and placing a sign over the gate, reading: 'The City of the Truly Good.'"

Another fact that is agitating the Kansas mind is that the Law and Order League of Sedgwick County, that State, has been placed in the hands of a receiver. The petition for the receiver states that the Rev. J. W. Woods is president of the league, N. B. Hagen, secretary and treasurer, and O. H. Bentley and Rudolph Hartfield its attorneys; that the league is wholly insolvent and that its assets are in danger of being squandered and appropriated to the individual use of certain members; that it has received in subscriptions $7,000 and has now in its treasury only thirteen cents, and that it owes Thomas Jackson $352 for work in obtaining evidence against the "joints," and other debts.
