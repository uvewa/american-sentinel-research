We have known that all Sunday laws have had for one of their prime objects compulsory Church attendance, and that all the talk about the "civil Sabbath" and "rest for the laboring man" has only been dodges and disguises to cover up this fact. In Australia where the Sunday movement has not as yet had so much opposition as in America, the advocates of compulsory Sunday observance have not found it so necessary to disguise their real aims. Here they quite unceremoniously insist upon the enforcement of Sunday laws in the interests of the churches. For instance, a deputation from the Victorian Lord's Day Observance Society waited on the Premier of Victoria, Jan. 4, 1894, to protest against the running of Sunday excursion trains. Statements made by two members of the deputation will illustrate what has just been said:—

Mr. DAFTY.—The direct effect of the running of the trains to Fern Tree Gully and other places must be to take people away from the churches.

MR. PATTERSON, THE PREMIER.—The movement has been described as a new departure. It is not a new departure. Sunday trains have been running for a long time, and for the ostensible purpose of taking people to church.

DR. HORNSTON.—But these trains are being run for the purpose of taking people away from church. They are purely for the people's pleasure.—Melbourne Herald, Jan. 4, 1894.

The following item which appeared in the Melbourne Evening Standard of Jan. 5, 1894, still farther shows the growing tendency and even more open efforts to compel the people to attend Church services:—

The members of one of the Homestead Associations formed some weeks ago would go a step further than the Lord's Day Observance Society desired the premier to proceed yesterday. The latter desired that Sunday trains to Fern Tree Gully and Healseville should be discontinued in order that people would not be tempted away from divine worship; but the Homestead Association decided that the minister should compel an irreligious member to go to church, or in the alternative, to expel him from the settlement. Mr. M'Intyre repeats what the premier said—that the government represents all classes, those who do not go to church and those who do, and while he would like all settlers to be model Christians, he can discover nothing in the statutes empowering him to penalize the delinquent for the sins of omission alleged against him? His ministerial duties were confined to mundane affairs.
