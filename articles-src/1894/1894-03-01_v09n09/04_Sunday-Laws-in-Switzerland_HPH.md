Our little freedom loving republic has not escaped the ever-spreading influence of Sunday law agitations. From America, the wave has swept over Europe and, breaking against the Alps, seems to have spent its greatest force in Switzerland. First, lecturers were sent across the Atlantic to agitate the public mind preparatory to organized effort.

In the past, various Sunday laws have existed in many of the countries of Europe; but in general they have been enacted as civil measures to protect the laboring masses against the tyranny of capital. As is well known, the European Sunday is a public holiday much more devoted to pleasure than to religion. In Switzerland, the more pious women attend church in the morning, while the men are out at the military targets practicing sharp shooting; and in the afternoon all, from the youngest to the oldest, swarm out to the beer-gardens, pleasure resorts, etc., and regale themselves with music, beer and tobacco. An idea of the proportion of the church-going people may be formed by the fact that in one quarter of Zurich with a population of more than fourteen thousand, from one to two dozen attend church on Sunday. In France, Sunday is still less a religious day than in Switzerland. The usual pleasures prevail, and are varied by an occasional bull-fight.

All that the masses desire is liberty to use Sunday as they wish. The original design of Sunday laws was to guard this liberty; but the religious Sunday sentiment, so prevalent in America, is gaining ground here. In 1876 an International Sunday Congress held at Geneva was attended by a large number of delegates of renown from the various nations. Since, local organizations have been formed as centers from which to carry on the warfare. A journal in French at Geneva, and one in German at Basle, have been published for the express purpose of securing better Sunday laws. Of course, the preachers carry on the work. They have kept their readers well informed in regard to the progress of the Sunday movement in America, through reports, extracts from such papers as "The Pearl of Days," etc.

Catholics are also active in the same direction, but through their own organization; yet they are in this movement on friendly terms with Protestants, and understand that all are working to the same end. It can readily be seen why the Catholics harmonize so well with Protestants in this work, for all that the latter do in honor of Sunday is in honor of the Catholic Church. By such a course, Protestants are setting a trap for themselves which Catholics will spring upon them when the opportune moment arrives. This being the case, it is but natural that they should be as interested and solicitous in this work of Protestants, as the spider was with the fly, when he so politely and meekly entreated, "Will you walk into my parlor?"

The Paris World's Fair in 1889 was seized upon as an occasion for advancing the Sunday cause. The congress there held was well attended and received attention from such distinguished persons as President Harrison, Gladstone, etc., who addressed the congress by letter. Later meetings have received attention and encouragement from Emperor William and others. Last summer, the German Reichstag devoted considerable time to the matter of Sunday laws, and the same received attention at Berne. In proportion as the rulers find themselves powerless to control the increasing discontent of turbulent millions, they instinctively turn to the Church for the needed help. History is repeating itself.

While the masses desire Sunday as a holiday, many of the preachers have something else in view. They profess to be working in the interest of the laboring man; but, as in America, the laboring men occasionally give a practical illustration of the fact that this gratuitous sympathy for them is but a decoy, and that there is really another motive behind the movement. The canton of Baselland furnishes an illustration of this. The ministers worked faithfully in the interests of a cantonal Sunday law, by periodicals, circulars, and mass meetings, claiming all the while that such a law was necessary to protect the laboring classes. After having agitated and canvassed the canton they claimed that over five thousand voters called for this law. By this means the legislative body of the canton was led to act on the question. A Sunday law was framed and submitted to popular vote. The astonishing result was that the law was rejected by a sweeping majority, there being but some two thousand votes in favor of it,—less than half claimed by the ministers. Thus, when permitted to speak for themselves, the laboring classes showed that they not only had no desire for a Sunday law, but were actually opposed to it. But the preachers thinking that the people are not sufficiently enlightened in the matter are diligently instructing them, and are thus trying to work up a sentiment in favor of Sunday laws that will carry.

What has taken place in the canton of Baselland is a fair representation of the situation in general. The preachers are the life of the Sunday law agitation. Left to themselves, the people would be quite indifferent on the subject. In the cities the preachers are the most successful for there they can ply the mighty lever of selfishness to gain their ends. Many families eke out a living by keeping a small shop or store in their dwelling. Some desire a free Sunday, while many of the less successful prefer to remain home to gain a few cents to make up if possible the deficit in their daily bread. But their more successful rivals virtually say to them, "We don't need to work on Sunday, so you mustn't. It may be that you will have a hard time to live without it, but what's that to us? We want to have a good time on Sunday, so let's make a Sunday law." From this class the preachers gain enthusiastic support in their pious work. It was chiefly on this ground that the canton of Basle City secured an iron-clad Sunday law last year. It will be on this basis that Sunday laws will be secured throughout Europe,—a basis as arbitrary as it is selfish,—and this is in fact the real nature of all Sunday laws. The agitation of this question grows warmer every year, and we have good reason to believe that soon Sunday laws will become quite general in Europe.
