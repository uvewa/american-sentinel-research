THE Catholic Standard, Archbishop Ryan's organ, says:—

Many of our non-Catholic newspapers are accustomed to speak of certain members of the hierarchy and other distinguished ecclesiastic and laymen as belonging to the party of "Liberal" Catholics. Such a party, we are happy to say, has no existence in the Catholic Church.

This is but molding in other phrase the familiar motto, "Rome never changes." It should serve as a warning to those who imagine that not only individual Catholics but that Rome herself is becoming liberal.
