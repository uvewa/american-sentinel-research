At the pope's reception in Rome, January 28, an allocution was read. The twelve thousand persons present "greeted the pope with prolonged cheering." The people of Rome were assured of the first place in Leo's affections, and that he was "gratified" with the testimony of their "devotion." He then expressed his "grief," evidently, because there are some who are not thus devoted, for he speaks of the "afflicted condition of Rome," and says:—

We earnestly desire that means should be found to end the present misery, and to re-establish promptly order in these parts.

In speaking of those, who are "responsible," he thinks, for this "misery," he says:—

It is to be hoped that the people at least will profit by their bitter experience, see first the origin of evil, and adopt the most efficacious remedy.

And to explain what he means by "the most efficacious remedy" the pope recommends that "they should approach confidently and without suspicion him who holds for God his supreme religious magistracy for the world's eternal life, whereof the pope is the dispenser." But before the "misery" could end, and "order" be "re-established" by the application of the "most efficacious remedy," "not only justice, but political common sense demands that those responsible for the condition of affairs should retrace their steps and restore [Leo's] religion to the honor wherein it was held by our ancestors." And to insure the cure to be permanent he suggests that "they should also have the virtue of rendering ever prosperous our mortal existence."

Are there not lessons in this for the American people, whom this (in)famous quack is dosing with his "most efficacious remedy" pronounced by Holy Writ to be a "cup full of abominations and filthiness of her fornications"?

The pope gives the people a reception and tells them of his affection. Does the pope love the people of Italy?—Oh! yes, he tells them so! It must be seen, however, that those who are thus entitled to his affections, and with whom he is "especially gratified" are those who by their testimony show their devotion, and patronize his most efficacious remedy. But for other reasons than Leo's those who have tested his medicines and seen the effect of many centuries, have learned by "bitter experience" that he is a ten times worse quack than those "quack doctors" who make the American dailies and weeklies conspicuous by their cure-all prescriptions "free of charge."

But to what does all this amount, to American people?—It amounts to a great deal—far more than the history of the Roman Church with all its inquisitorial records contains. Is not Dr. Leo dosing the American people?—Hear him! "I love them, and I love their country. I have great tenderness for those that live in that land. Protestants and all." And has he not both sent and appointed agents and have not a great many, even of those whose names are followed by "D.D." "Protestants and all," done all in their power to advertise him, by advocating Roman principles as the only "efficacious remedy" for the moral and material ruin of this nation?

Whose medicines have the National Reformers had on the market for a quarter of a century? What were and are the so-called American Sabbath, Union, and the other "Sabbath" and Sunday leagues, and Sunday protective associations doing? If you don't know whose remedy these were recommending ask Leo XIII., and he can, whether he does or not, tell you, that every pen ever dipped, every tongue ever moved, every petition ever sent to Congress, asking for Sunday legislation, every enforcement by the States of old or new Sunday laws causing imprisonment of the keepers of "the Sabbath of the Lord," making their mortal existence exceedingly unprosperous; whatever is done to exult the Catholic Sunday, is having the virtue that makes Leo's "mortal existence prosperous," to the "moral and material ruin of the nation"?

In this dilemma "what shall we do to be saved"? There is only one remedy for the people of Rome, for the people of America, for the people of all nations of this world, viz: to approach confidently and without suspicion Him, in whose affection we had the first place when we were not devoted, who alone holds the supreme religious magistracy of the eternal life of the world to come, whereof Jesus Christ is the dispenser, who is "full of grace and truth" and "able to save to the uttermost all that come to him." And though our mortal existence may be made unprosperous by his enemies, he promises support in this life, and in the world to come eternal life. And he gives us this everlasting consolation that when he comes to destroy that "wicked one" by the brightness of his coming, we may appear with him in glory. Let us approach Him.

L. F. HANSEN.
