[The Catholic Standard thus concludes a notice of Prince Bismarck's return to Berlin.]

AFTER many years of retirement he again visits Berlin and the scenes of his palmy days. But the times are changed for him, and other rulers contest or overshadow his popularity. When he appears in public a few cheers greet his presence, but they are not even the echo of the spontaneous ovation that used to greet the coming of the great chancellor long ago. He has no place and no voice in the Reichstag, he does not meet in the conference of the king's ministers, his policy or advice is not sought for in the deliberations of matters of State, the mantle of greatness has fallen from his shoulders, his star has set! In looking around, he sees, moreover, that his old enemy, the Catholic Church, is neither dead nor defeated. The old Catholic Church which he himself formed and tried to put in her place has gone to seed and is nearly extinguished, while the true old church is prolific with new life. The Catholic deputies have increased their numbers in the Reichstag, their power and influence are courted as a conservative strength, the May laws against the freedom of religious worship are abrogated, churches are restored to their original owners, religious orders are allowed to pursue their legitimate calling in schools and colleges, and the last edict on the banishment of the Jesuits is revoked by a strong majority. All this must be a bitter mixture in the cup of enjoyment (?) for the ex-chancellor in his visit. Verily, "the mills of God grind slowly, but they grind exceeding small."
