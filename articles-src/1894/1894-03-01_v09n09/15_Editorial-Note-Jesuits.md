A Catholic paper says that, with the approval of the pope, the general of the Jesuits has written to the emperor of Germany expressing thanks for the progress of the bill for restoring his order to favor in the empire. Father Martin promises that the society will be very good, and devote its energies to Catholic education, and to the training of missionaries who shall carry the gospel (of the Jesuits, of course) to the colonies of the empire. The remarkable feature of the case is that this is just what Bismarck expelled them for.

Exchange.
