THE following is the text of the Sunday bill for the District of Columbia referred to on the last page of this paper. We are informed that it is soon to be introduced in the House by Henry W. Blair, the father of the "Blair bills," who will also introduce a bill for a national Sunday law:—

53RD CONGRESS,
2ND SESSION.

S. 1628.

IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES.

FEBRUARY 15, 1894.

MR. GALLINGER (by request) introduced the following bill; which was read twice and referred to the Committee on Education and Labor.

A BILL

To protect the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, as a day of rest and worship in the District of Columbia.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That on the first day of the week, known as the Lord's day, set apart by general consent in accordance with divine appointment as a day of rest and worship, it shall be unlawful to perform any labor, except works of necessity and mercy and work by those who religiously observe Saturday, if performed in such a way as not to involve or disturb others; also to open places of business or traffic, except in the case of drug stores for the dispensing of medicines; also to make contracts or transact other commercial business; also to engage in noisy amusements or amusements for gain, or entertainments for which admittance fees are charged; also to join in public processions, except funerals, which last shall not use music; also to perform any court service, except in connection with arrests of criminals and service of process to prevent fraud.

Sec. 2. That the penalty for violating any provision of this act shall be a fine of not less than ten dollars for the first offense; for second or subsequent offenses, a fine not exceeding fifty dollars, and imprisonment for not less than ten nor more than thirty days, and one year's forfeiture of license, if any is held by the offender or his employer.

Sec. 3. That this act shall take effect upon its passage.

It will be seen that this bill throws a sop to Seventh-day Adventists in the shape of an exemption clause. But the so-called exemption will be spurned by every consistent Sabbath-keeper. Congress has no right to pass such a bill either with or without an exemption. The principle is wrong and no amount of exemption can make it right. So long as the right to touch religious questions is asserted by the law-making power the evil remains no matter how attenuated it may be. Adventists will oppose the whole thing.
