The United States Supreme Court decision that "this is a Christian nation," received a striking confirmation recently in the Senate proceedings. It was the next day after Ash Wednesday, and Senator Voorhees, with a pious regard for the sacred observance of the Lenten season, made a motion that the Senate adjourn till the following Monday on the ground that the next day was "Good Friday," and there was no reason why they should not regard it by discontinuing the regular business. The newspapers report that other senators agreed and the motion prevailed. To the surprise of all it was afterward discovered that a mistake of five weeks had been made in their haste to honor the church holy day.

These are the same gentlemen who lately decided that the seventh day of the fourth commandment now comes on Sunday, the first day of the week, and, therefore, passed the bill closing the gates of the World's Fair on Sunday. This action met with great favor from the clergy and the religious press who saw wonderful visions of good in their deference to the ideas of the churches. I have not heard that any rejoicing has been indulged in because the thirty-eighth day of Lent has become the third according to the computation of these Christian statesmen. Either their mathematics or theology is wrong in both instances. If they can reckon the first day of the week the seventh, then why not let them make the third day of Lent the thirty-eighth? The latter is only a human arrangement anyway, while the other is fixed by divine appointment. Of course the last blunder did not become a law, but possibly it might supply proof to succeeding generations that Lent has only three days as convincing as some that is now offered to prove that the Sabbath comes on Sunday. The fact that the apostles met on the first day of the week for meeting in one instance is the very bulwark of Sunday observance. No law for it can be found, but the example is thought to be enough. Suppose that eighteen centuries hence some one should read in the Congressional Record that the Senate in this Christian nation did adjourn the third day of Lent because it was Good Friday, could any one longer dispute the obligation to follow such a practice? I am not trying to prove that the present senator is the counterpart of the early Christian, but only this, are men who are so far from the truth in the present instance infallible guides in the other? Shall we put the decision of religious questions in their hands? Both show forgetfulness. The command is, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy," but the Senate has forgotten it. The period called Lent has forty days, but this was temporarily forgotten and shortened to five.

But if it had been true that Good Friday came at the time supposed, why was it necessary for the Senate to adjourn? Is it the business of the civil rulers to conform to all the church feasts or feasts in their official capacity? Will they show similar respect to Saint Patrick's Day, and to the Hebrew Day of Atonement? If not, why not? These questions all belong to the opening chapter in a union of Church and State. The closing chapter will tell of bitter persecution for those who reject the holy days made by Congress and obey those given by God himself. Already the issue is joined between the State and individuals who practice what the law of God commands, namely, keep the seventh day and work the other six. For this they are imprisoned while judges, juries, and politicians pay an ever increasing regard to the festivals of the church which have no authority in the Scriptures.

H. E. ROBINSON.
