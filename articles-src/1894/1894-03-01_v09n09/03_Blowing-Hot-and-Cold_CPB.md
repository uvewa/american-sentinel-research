The so-called *Christian Reformer*, published in Allegheny, Pa., by the Covenanter Publishing Company, and edited, presumably, by Rev. David McAllister, D. D., in commenting on the recent decision of the Maryland Court of Appeals in the case of J. W. Judefind, convicted for husking corn on Sunday, says:—

Of course it will seem to Adventists a most unfair and unjust comparison, but the fact is that the violators of Sabbath law are to be dealt with as the violators of other laws on the statute books of our States. We most cordially indorse the following from the *Christian Intelligencer*: "The worst enemies of a day of rest and worship are those who enforce the penalties of the civil law against persons who conscientiously observe the seventh day of the week, and therefore pursue their ordinary vocations on the first day. So long as such persons do not hinder others from enjoying the rest and privilege of Sunday, they are entitled to pursue their own chosen course without let or hindrance." But the very essence of the breach of our State Sabbath laws is the infringement of the right of other citizens to the enjoyment of the rest and privileges of the Lord's day. Adventists may spend the Christian Sabbath, so long as their conduct concerns themselves alone, as they may see fit to spend it. But when their conduct on that day involves the question of the rights and welfare of the social body as against the rights claimed by the Adventists themselves, the courts must enforce what is for the highest good of the social body. And as no true right of any citizen can ever be in conflict with the rights and duties of the social being, so the strict enforcement of all just laws, including Sabbath laws, can never infringe upon the rights of any individual citizen or subject.

This is blowing both hot and cold in a single breath. How could husking corn in one's own field, and at a considerable distance from a public road, and that in the quietest manner possible, not from the standing stalk as is sometimes the case, but from a shock, possibly "hinder others from enjoying the rest and privilege of Sunday"? It could not unless one "privilege" of Sunday is to domineer over others. But we do not grant, however, that any one is under any obligation to be specially quiet in his Sunday work. People have just the same natural, God-given right to work on Sunday that they have to work on other days. There is no more reason why the Adventist should sneak to his Sunday work like a criminal, than there is that the Sunday keeper should hide behind fences and hedges on Monday. Nevertheless, as a rule, Adventists are very unobtrusive in their Sunday work, and do not, as is frequently falsely asserted, make themselves as conspicuous as possible on that day. It is true the *Reformer* does not make this charge in so many words, but the whole tone of the article is one of insinuation, as though their conduct on Sunday did involve the rights of others.

The Reformer continues:—

The maintenance of the Sabbath laws of our States is not to be compared to the enforcement of the fugitive slave law, or of any law conflicting with the high standard of Christian morals. It is rather to be compared with the law against polygamy. The Mormons plant themselves on the Old Testament scriptures in very much the same way as do the Adventists. In the one case as in the other we have a perversion of the moral laws of the divine Word against the good order of Christian civil government. And while the Mormons, like the Adventists, will complain of infringement of religious liberties, the good order of a Christian nation must be upheld against them both.

The SENTINEL has more than once shown that Sunday laws and laws against polygamy are not analogous. Moreover, as a question of Christian ethics between the so-called *Christian Reformer* and the Adventists, the editor of the former knows that "in one case as in the other we have" and "a perversion of the moral laws of the divine Word against the good order of Christian civil government." When it comes to the divine Word the Adventists have everything in their favor. That Word says plainly, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." Where, then, is the authority for the first day? The editor of the *Christian(?) Reformer* should remember also that other commandment which says, "Thou shalt not bear false witness."
