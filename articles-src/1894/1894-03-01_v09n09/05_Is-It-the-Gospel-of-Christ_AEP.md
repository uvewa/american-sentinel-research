When Christ was here he preached the gospel and he lived the gospel, i.e., "the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth." Rom. 1:16. "Whatever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." Matt. 7:12; and, "If any man hear my word and believe not, I judge him not; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world." John 12:47. The life of Christ was (and ought it not to be so now?) the root of the gospel; it was the trunk of the gospel; it was the branch, blossom, and fruit of the gospel—yea, it was and it still is the gospel. And "though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel . . . let him be accursed." Gal. 1:8. Anything against the life and principles of Christ in this world is not the gospel of Christ, and therefore is not "the power of God."

With those spiritual weapons mentioned above, Christ went forth to the work of salvation—the work of the gospel. He asked for no office in the government. He asked for no kingdom. He asked for no swords or laws of man or nations; and when the swords and staves of men came to take him, he fought no battle; he asked for no legal counsel, but was led as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth. And when hanging bleeding upon the cross, and a laughing, scoffing crowd with wagging heads looking upon the scene of agony, he lifts his eyes to heaven and cries, "Father, forgive them," and then died "like a God." Reader, in that life and that death you may see what is necessary to salvation.

When Christ sent forth his disciples to carry on his work, they went, saying, "The weapons of our warfare are not carnal" (not of this world), but "we beseech you [we pray you], in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God." That was the gospel—the same gospel of the meek, forgiving, yet triumphant Saviour, Jesus Christ, and with it those humble disciples found power enough to go against all the swords and laws of the united Roman Empire, and with Pentecostal power they triumphed in the conversion of "three thousand souls" in a single day.

If there was power enough in the gospel of Christ at that time, without any law of governments of earth in its favor, but all the power of "the iron monarchy of Rome" against it, to establish itself as it did, ought it ever to need governmental laws, or governmental aid in any way in order to continue? Will it ever need it? No, never!

What, then, must that gospel be that does need this aid? What gospel must those have who to-day are so eagerly seeking by lobbying, by boycott, resolutions, etc., to obtain such aid? Verily I say unto you, it is "another gospel" and not "the power of God unto salvation." It cannot be the gospel of Christ—the life of Christ, for he did not live that way.

Dear reader, "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus." Study and accept his life and you will receive and know the gospel.
